Song Name: Come Along
I saw the poet
At the edge
They were speaking
Some tough, some French
I'll be speaking out
You'll stand victim
As I am, I'll be waiting
You'll be seeing
Sleep alone, don't you sleep alone
Don't you be alone, don't you be alone tonight
I'll see where the Devil's gonna be in the morning time
The morning time
You got love, you got sleep, you got everything but me
I saw it
Oh, baby, I saw it
I did
But I'll be waiting all the way for you
And my lungs are constricted
Baby, there ain't nothing I can't do
Sleep alone, don't you sleep alone
Don't you be alone, don't you be alone tonight
I'll see where the Devil's gonna be in the morning time
The morning time
You got love, you got sleep, you got everything but me
Oh, ow
Sleep alone, don't you sleep alone
Don't you be alone, don't you be alone tonight
I'll see where the Devil's gonna be in the morning time
The morning time
You got love, you got sleep
You got everything but me
