Song Name: Boyfriend
Young heart, oh what a waste
Especially for such a pretty face, now
It's too bad in any case
I guess I'll be the one that got away
So go, go
Try your sad style on somebody else
No, no
Stay away with your sad songs
I don't wanna be your boyfriend
When you need a little company
I don't wanna be your boyfriend, no
When there's not another phone to ring
Friday night, you call me up
But you got my number wrong
I don't wanna be your boyfriend
Your boyfriend, your boyfriend
No, oh, oh
So cool with a cigarette
Your greatest hits on tape cassette
Brand new Dior jacket on
A cracked screen on your telephone, oh no
So go, go
Try your sad style on somebody else
No, no
Stay away with your sad songs
I don't wanna be your boyfriend
When you need a little company
I don't wanna be your boyfriend, no
When there's not another phone to ring
Friday night, you call me up
But you got my number wrong
I don't wanna be your boyfriend
Your boyfriend, your boyfriend
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
You heard it wrong, you heard it wrong
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
You heard it wrong, you heard it wrong
I'm not your boyfriend
When you need a little company
Ah, I'm not your boyfriend
When there's not another phone to ring
Friday night, you call me up
But you got my number wrong
I don't wanna be your boyfriend
Your boyfriend, your boyfriend
No, no, no!
