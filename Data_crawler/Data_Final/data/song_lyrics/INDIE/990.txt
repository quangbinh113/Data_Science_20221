Song Name: miss me if u want to
Why waste my time
Girl when you say that I'm the only
Up late at night
You thought you knew but you don't know me
I just want someone
Someone I can talk to
I bet that you won't
Miss me like you ought to
Spend a check, I'm a mess
Loneliness, I know it
Out at night, yeah I might
Acting like I know I'll be alright
Run away, whatcha say
Trace my steps to your apartment
Why waste my time
Girl when you say that I'm the only
Up late at night
Girl, I think you could get to know me
We all want someone
Someone we can talk to
I bet that you could
Miss me if you want to
Yeah you could miss me if you want to
Yeah you could miss me if you want to
And if you don't know what to say
You could just look at me that way
That way
Why waste my time
Girl when you say that I'm the only
Up late at night
Girl, you should know I wish you knew me
Just hit my line
You know if you want someone to talk to
I bet that you could
Miss me like you ought to
Yeah you could miss me if you want to
Yeah you could miss me if you want to
