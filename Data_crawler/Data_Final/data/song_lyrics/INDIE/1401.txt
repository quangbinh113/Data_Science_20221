Song Name: Back on the Fence
I am back on the fence again
Okay, yeah, okay
Okay, yeah, I'm okay
I'm just back on the fence
I'm moving backwards in slow motion
A still horizon, but here I am again (here I am again)
Slipping on frozen moments
I know they're not for me
So I creep
Maybe if I'm staying for a moment I will feel it
But maybe it's all for nothing
Maybe if I'm staying 'til the morning I will feel something
I'm back on the fence
Another week (another week)
Another year (another year)
Eventually I'll disappear
It's easy to fight it
Out of sight, out of mind it
I'm sleeping through sirens again
I'm back on the fence
Splitting hairs like atoms
And I can't fathom this will of the wisp
Spinning in vicious circles
Wondering when I'll give in again
All my friends would say there's more to this
There's more to this than
Skipping stoned, tripping home
My back on the fence
I'm back on the fence
I'm back on the fence
Eventually I'll disappear
It's easy to fight it
Out of sight, out of mind it
Run from my fears
I'm tethered in heather greys and evergreens
I'm inside out or in between
I'm in a daze, it's just a phase
