Song Name: Did I Make You Up?
Lost in a daydream
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real?
Did I make you up?
Was I wrong?
Did I make you up?
All along
I've been wakin' up
You're clearly disconnected
So, who am I connected to?
Some person you projected
Were you ever telling me the truth?
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was naive
Lost in a daydream
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real?
Did I make you up?
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was naive
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was naive
Lost in a daydream
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real?
Did I make you up?
Did I make you up?
Did I make you into someone else now?
So in love with who you won't become
Were you ever real?
Did I make you up?
