Song Name: New House
It doesn't come that easy anyway
Every time I try
It never feels the way it did at the start
This one for my dawgs
That see where I'm coming from
And know why it's hard
I do it for you
No one can save me this evening
She does her all but
I've never been the easiest ride
She says, "It's okay, we know it's alright"
(So I said picture it)
I can see us in a house next year
(You'll be) making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
(And stay) keeping it real with me all the time
All the while, they can't touch me anyway
So I'll be holding it down with you every day
(Oh, yeah)
Holding it down (Oh)
Oh, oh, I'll be holding it down
Holding it down (Yeah)
Oh, oh
I'm so good at falling asleep
Grateful for you waking me
If it weren't for you
I would've stayed here for weeks
And the bed is just upstairs
The only place I feel peace
There's nothing I forgot to do
Nowhere that I'ma need to be
There's no one left for me to impress
How am I meant to know what's good
When nothing good on the screen?
It's been the same way for a while
Now and I'ma come clean
You know that I haven't been inspired
Since like I was 18
And the extra stress isn't necessary anyway
So the only thing that's worrying is right
In front of me in a line
And life is too short to be staying inside
But I didn't realize I ran from the light
And no one can save me, I'm bleeding
I do my best, but I rarely am a regular guy
At least I've got 3-6-4 more days to get it right
(Take a seat, picture this)
I can see us in a house next year
You'll be making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
You'll be keeping it real with me all the time
No distraction, no one's even tryna reach me
Well, not until they need something, honestly
And the trouble is
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time (Time)
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time

Oh yeah
It doesn't happen like this every day
Every time I look at her
I feel the way I did at the start
She's holding me up, I'll never depart
All the emotions straight from the heart
She got me all in my feelings
I wouldn't know how to live
Life if it wasn't with her
I know what it's worth
