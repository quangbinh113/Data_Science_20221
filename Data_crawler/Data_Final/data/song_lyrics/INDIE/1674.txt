Song Name: Nonexistent
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know I saw it
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know
(Haa haa, oh oh ouu)
(Haa haa, oh oh)
(Haa haa, oh oh ouu)
(Haa haa, oh oh)
My day is nonexistent
When you're away from me
I keep my heart at distance, oh
Would you even try to let him go?
We both know it's waiting there
Let him go
I felt you, you felt me
I bet you know what I mean
Whenever I get to you I'm daydreamin'
Now, oh
We gonna leave it all behind
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know I saw it
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know
(Haa haa, oh oh ouu)
(Haa haa, oh oh)
(Haa haa, oh oh ouu)
(Haa haa, oh oh)
Oh can I be existent?
In your mind at least
I keep my heart at distance, oh
Would you even try to let him go?
We both know it's waiting there
Let him go, oh oh
I felt you, you felt me
I bet you know what I mean
Whenever I get to you I'm daydreamin'
Now, oh
We cannot leave it all behind
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know I saw it
Am I to believe it?
Should I just ignore it?
It feels kinda distant
But I know I saw it
(Ha ha, oh oh ouu)
(Ha ha, oh oh)
(Ha ha, oh oh ouu)
(Ha ha, oh oh)
We shouldn't be acting like this
It was really lovely to meet ya
We shouldn't be acting like this
It was really lovely to meet ya
But now I'm gonna leave
I'ma let it go
(Oh, aaa, should we let it go?)
(Oh, aaa, should we let it go?)
