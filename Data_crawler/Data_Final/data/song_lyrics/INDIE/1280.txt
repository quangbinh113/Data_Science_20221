Song Name: Angelica
Angelica was on her way to the party
She doesn't need to wait for anybody (what-ah)
Knows exactly what's she's doin'
I watch as she commands the room (commands the room)
The ambience was overrated at the party
Want to run away before it's even started
I look at my feet, then I look for the door (the door)
Can't find my friends, so I just take a bit more
A bit more, a bit more
A bit more, a bit more
A bit more, a bit more
A bit more, a bit more
A bit more
And then it all
Comes to an end
We all go again
Go again
Good times, all the tim–µ
Good times, all the time
Angelica, she brought lasagne to the party
I tried my luck at dancin' with everybody
Sometimes life gets hard to deal
I like you, you've got sex appeal
But I don't wanna follow you on the 'Gram
I don't wanna listen to your band
I don't know why I haven't left yet
Don't want none of this
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Angelica, she brought her ray gun to the party
Angelica obliterated everybody
I look at my hands then I look for the door
Can't help but feel like I've been here before
I don't know what I'm even doin' here
I was told that there would be free beer
I don't wanna follow you on the 'Gram
I don't wanna listen to your band
And then it all
Comes to an end
We all go again
Go again
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
Good times, all the time
