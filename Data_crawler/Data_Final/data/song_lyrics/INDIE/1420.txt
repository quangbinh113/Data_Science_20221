Song Name: Invisible Fence
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you could tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
Be careful, be still
My little lost one
Just keep a hand on the wheel
I know you got some
Okay, then drop some
Recoup off that last one
So now I feel like Top Gun
Where you, where you drop from
You supposed to love me
Who you get your ends from?
Damn you sorta fancy
Them bed sheets like satin
So smashing
Wanna wake up in Bed-Stuy like Aladdin
Got a whole world I can show you
If we end up, shits too deep
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you could tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you could tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
The other night was like gymnastics
Doing backflips
Think it's crazy how you acting
Are you an actress?
Say it like you mean it
Make it more dramatic
Crazy how you keep on laughing
I know it helps but
Wish I knew how it all happened
My brain got patches
I've been easing on the gas
Need some balance
Now shit is looking backwards
Never that
Yeah, yeah
Keep me coming back
Keep me coming back
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you could tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you can tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
I think I missed the mark
I'm going 'til it gets real
And then I'm going dark
She asked me, "How does it feel?"
I said, "It's glorious"
I wonder how you could tell
When there was four of us
Okay, borders up
