Song Name: One More Hour
Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until
All that I have
And everything's still
The minutes are racin'
Whatever I've done
I did it for love
I did it for fun
Couldn't get enough
I did it for fame
But never for money
Not for houses
Not for her
Not for my future children
Until now
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) how could I love again?
(Move on) how can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) with no more time to spend
(Move on) I know the answer more and more
As long as I can
Long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
Long as I can
Be the man I am
Oh, life is strange
For one more hour
I can rage
For one more hour
As long as I can (lose her)
As long as I can (move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (lose her)
As long as I can (move on)
Remember who I am
As long as I can (lose her)
As long as I can (move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
As long as I can (how could I love again?)
Be the man I am
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said they wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute fella right before you go out there
