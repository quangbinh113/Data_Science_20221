Song Name: MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want
Come, lay me down
'Cause you know this
'Cause you know this sound
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake, I crave your taste
All night long 'til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh, no, ooh-ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh-oh
These burning flames, these crashing waves
Wash over me like a hurricane
I captivate, you're hypnotized
Feel powerful, but it's me again
Come, lay me down
'Cause I know this
'Cause I know this sound
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake, I crave your taste
All night long 'til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh, no, ooh-ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh-oh
And just call on me, ah
Just call my nameã…¤
Like you'll need me
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake, I crave your taste
All night long 'til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh-oh-whoa
