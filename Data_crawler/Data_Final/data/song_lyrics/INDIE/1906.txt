Song Name: Makeup
One, two, three, four
It takes some time to make your mind up
Takes some time to make up your mind
And all my life, my mind's been changing
All the pieces rearranging
You take my love and throw it away
But sadly, my love's not for others to play with, oh
It takes some time to make your mind up
Takes some time to make up your mind
And all my life, my mind's been changing
All the pieces rearranging
You take my love and throw it away, yeah
Sadly, my love's not for others to play with, oh
It takes some time to make your mind up
Takes some time to make up your mind
It takes some time to make your mind up
Takes some time to make up your mind
