Song Name: *sigh* Nevermind
I'm putting my finger down
But it's in my pocket, won't let it out
Rippin a hole in my denim jeans
If it tears through, I can't stop it now
Biting my tongue 'til I taste the blood
It's not half bad but it's not that good
I'll eat my words 'til my belly aches
My tummy hurts 'cause I'm scared to say
Just breathe baby (just breathe)
It'll all be over soon (it'll all be over soon)
Go back to your tree baby (ahh)
And stay in your cocoon (it'll all be over soon)
...
So many thoughts running through my head
That's where I'll leave them, left unsaid
I'm not fully misunderstood
I just can't seem to talk good
So give me some of your time, I just need patience
And I don't wanna stay silent
But I don't feel free, free to speak
'Cause your words always bury mine
And I don't want to compete
So just forget me
Backspace, delete
I'll leave it be
Just breathe baby (just breathe)
It'll all be over soon (it'll all be over soon)
Go back to your tree baby (ahh)
And stay in your cocoon (it'll all be over soon)
Just breathe baby (just breathe)
It'll all be over soon (it'll all be over soon)
Go back to your tree baby (ahh)
And stay in your cocoon (it'll all be over soon)
