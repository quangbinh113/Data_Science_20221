Song Name: Not Quite
Not quite alright
Yeah, I got the whole place to myself
Not feeling fine
Oh, you got the whole house to yourself
And I'm really not doing very well
No, I'm not really not doing very well
Not feeling fine
Oh, I know that I'm bad for your health
Not quite alright
I know this might be out of line
But I'm really not doing very well
No, I'm really not doing very well
Do not turn on others, as suggested to
The dark, dark blue
The dark, dark
Do not turn on others, as suggested to
The dark, dark blue
The dark, dark
Not quite alright
Yeah I know that you've been up all night
Not feeling fine
Oh, I know that you don't all the time
But I'm really not doing very well
No, I'm really not doing very well
Do not turn on others, as suggested to
The dark, dark blue
The dark, dark
Do not turn on others, as suggested to
The dark, dark blue
The dark, dark
