Song Name: My Type
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises
How to go about and choose?
Break it down by shapes and sizes
I'm a man who's got very specific taste
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
When there's loving in the air
Don't fight it, just keep breathing
I can't help myself but stare
Double check for double meanings
I'm a man who's got very specific taste
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-dah
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-dah
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da, da-da
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
