Song Name: One Day
And stop
'Cause why'd you have to kill my cat?
Why'd I have to take you back?
And time and time, I play the empath
I don't know why
But some lights on in an empty pub
A toilet with the seat left up
Is closure like a deer in headlights
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
She said, "Let's talk about what I want to do"
'Cause all I want to do is turn back time
At least a couple Tuesdays
To before I found one life turn two
I said it last time
But I'm not afraid of empty rooms
I'm not afraid of new perfume
And, in fact, my dear, I'm fucking terrified
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
Woo!
'Cause I know that
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh baby, isn't life so
Fucking inconsistent?
