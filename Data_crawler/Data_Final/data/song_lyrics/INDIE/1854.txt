Song Name: Gush
I shouldn't have told you
That I was ready
Before I knew I was
It's not that I didn't try
To keep my shit together
This whole ordeal just took over
When you told me for the first time
I was speechless
I couldn't believe my ears
Is this what I've become?
Apologetic in song
To feel obliged to right what I did wrong
To right what I did wrong
To right what I did wrong
To right what I did wrong
(For that mistake I'm sorry)
(For that mistake I'm sorry)
(For that mistake I'm sorry)
(For that mistake I'm sorry)
