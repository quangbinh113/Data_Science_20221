Song Name: So Sad, So Sad
So sad, so sad
I could never make you stay
Too bad, too bad
I could never walk away
So sad, so sad
I rely upon cliche
To help me explain
Why I will never be the same
Trying to be a perfect circle
Neat just like I take my drinks
A crumb upon my plate
Leads to a week of crying streaks
I'll never walk away, walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never make you stay
It's such a shame
Even wind knocks me around
It's not that I don't try
It's just that I'm better on the ground
What if I gave
My ambition for a brain?
Only a fool
Would approve that trade
Trying to be a perfect circle
Weak just like I take my drinks
A crumb upon my plate
Leads to a week of cryin' sleep
I'll never walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never walk away, walk away
I could never make you stay
