Song Name: We Didn't Even Date
We didn't even date
Then why do I still got so damn much to say
Well, maybe it's my fault
Get attached and then still call it love
Think of you all the time
Doesn't matter 'cause I'm not even on your mind
Wish I could just take it all back
Didn't date but we might as well have
Probably shouldn't cry
'Cause you weren't my boyfriend of that kind
Maybe you're just nice
Give me a few days
Make feelings go away
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
'Cause we didn't even date
Then why do I still got so damn much to say
Maybe it's my fault
Get attached and then still call it love
Think of you all the time
Doesn't matter 'cause I'm not even on your mind
Wish I could just take it all back
Didn't date but we might as well have
Didn't date, didn't date
Kinda hate that you stay
On my mind all the time
'Cause you're not even mine
Didn't date, didn't date
Kinda hate that you stay
On my mind all the time
'Cause you're not even mine
Didn't date, didn't date
Kinda hate that you stay
On my mind all the time
'Cause you're not even mine
Didn't date, didn't date
Kinda hate that you stay
On my mind all the time
'Cause you're not even mine
We didn't even date
But I've still got so damn much to say
And I'd never take it back
Didn't date, but I wish that we had
