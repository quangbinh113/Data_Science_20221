Song Name: People I Don't Like
Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah
This room is so suffocating
Walking on ice, but nobody breaks it
Stuck in this one-way conversation
Guess I'll be here for a while
And you're blowing smoke in my face
And telling me all about your paycheck
Take a shot with a fake smile to chase it
Guess I'll take another round
Everybody in this party's fucking fake
I really wish that I could say it to your face
But I won't, so
Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah
Blah, blah, blah, I'm so bored
Love your shoes, tell me more
On and on about yourself
Can't you bother somebody else?
Raise a glass if you're like me, yeah
Getting trashed, 'cause you can't leave
Guess we're in this together
Makes my head hurt
Everybody in this party's fucking fake
And so am I, but I just got here so I gotta show some face
Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah
To the people I don't like
You're trying too hard
(Keep trying, keep trying, keep trying)
To the people I don't like
To the people I don't, don't, d-don't, don't, don't
