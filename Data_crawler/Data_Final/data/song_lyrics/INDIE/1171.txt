Song Name: Unwind
All work no play, that's why you're uptight
You pay no mind to what you feel inside
Put your mind at ease 'cause you pay no rent
Just let me know when you're ready to unwind
I want to see you satisfied
If you ever need a break
If you ever need to settle down
We can swim into a daze
I promise that you're never gonna drown
We don't need to give and take
Evaporate and let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off
Walk into the room like you need answers
When it don't matter what you think you'll find
Set your phone aside so we could get lost
In things that don't cost a penny of your time
Don't tell me that you're satisfied
If you ever need a break
If you ever need to settle down
We can swim into a daze
I promise that you're never gonna drown
We don't need to give and take
Evaporate and let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off
We could take a day off
We could take a day off
Swim and ride the wave
We could take the day off
If you want to
We could take the day off
Swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
If you ever need a break
If you ever need to settle down
We can swim into a daze
I promise that you're never gonna drown
We don't need to give and take
Evaporate and let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off
And we could take a day off
