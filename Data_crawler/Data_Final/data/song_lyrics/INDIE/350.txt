Song Name: I Don't Miss You at All
I swear I don't
Miss you at all
And I barely still remember
Who's in the pictures on my wall
'Cause, no, I can't
Recall your scent
Jasmine, Tuberose, and Lily
Or your silly French accent
All but forgotten
About those eyes
The shade of green that if he'd seen
Would make F. Scott Fitzgerald cry
But I won't
Break down at 2 AM and call
'Cause I don't
Miss you at all
And I'm sleeping fine
I don't mean to boast
But I only dream about you
Once or twice a night at most
And it feels so good
Eating alone
I don't get distracted by your smile
And miss the green lights driving home
No sign of stopping
The house isn't far
But I think our song is coming on
And now I wanna crash the car
But I won't
Make that mistake again and fall
So I say I don't
Miss you at all
And someday I won't
Miss you at all
