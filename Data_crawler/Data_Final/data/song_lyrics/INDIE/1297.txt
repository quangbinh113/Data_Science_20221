Song Name: Bunny Is A Rider
Bunny is a rider, satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider, satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy, hmm, ain't nothing
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her, no sympathy, hmm
But I'm so nonphysical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name (yeah)
Bunny is a rider, satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider, giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy, hmm, ain't nothing for free
Dirty like it's Earth Day, tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check, crush that wreck? Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday, can I go as Alice?
Tryna catch that rabbit
But I'm so nonphysical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh (ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
Yeah, I'm so nonphysical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, firеworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a ridеr
Can't find her, eeh (ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh (ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh (ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a
Bunny is a rider
