Song Name: Mr. Lonely
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
Wish I had someone to call on the phone
Now, I am a soldier
A lonely soldier
Away from home
Through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home
Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I've been forgotten
Yeah, forgotten
Oh, how I wonder how is it I failed
Now, I am a soldier
A lonely soldier
Away from home
Through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home
