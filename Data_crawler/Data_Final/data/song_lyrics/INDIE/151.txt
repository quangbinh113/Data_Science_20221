Song Name: happy never after
Once upon a time, I still believed in myself
I was happy being me and didn't need any help
And then somebody that I trusted
Crushed the feelings I felt
I guess a happy never after was the deal I was dealt
True love doesn't have a happy ending
Cause when it's real, it doesn't ever end
If I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?
Would I flip the script or would I do it all again?
Am I the hero, or maybe the villain?
Am I the sidekick, or even the fill-in?
I'll keep going out for every roll
In a story that'll never be told
If I wrote you a note, would you ever listen?
If we never met, would you be who I'm missing?
I'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete
The story that'll never be we
I been havin' trouble with believin' in love
Ever since the day you left me, it depressed me and thus
I haven't met somebody worth believin' in much
I guess the movies I grew up on didn't teach me enough
Learnin' to grow and go and sew my broken heart up
Doesn't happen in an hour, just like Hollywood does
There's a problem and you solve it
That's the way they taunt us
But how am I s'posed to fix me if I'm all that I've got?
True love doesn't have a happy ending (No, it doesn't)
Cause when it's real, it's never really dead
If I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?
Would I flip the script or would I do it all again?
Am I the hero, or maybe the villain?
Maybe the sidekick, or even the fill-in?
I'll keep going out for every roll
In a story that'll never grow old
If I wrote you a note, I hope that you'd listen
And if we never met
You'd probably be who I'm missing
I'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete
The story that'll never be we
Yeah, we'll never be we
Yeah, we'll never be we
Fuck
