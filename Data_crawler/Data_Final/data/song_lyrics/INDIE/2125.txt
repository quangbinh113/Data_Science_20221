Song Name: The 1975
This will get bigger if you know what I mean
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I heard it's en vogue to be super thin
But your friends aren't thick so they can't come in
I'm feelin' apathetic after scrollin' through hell
I think I've got a boner
But I can't really tell and the fans are on
It's cynical
This Adderall
And vitriol
And young people drinkin' Aperol
And it's about time
This is what it looks like
I'm sorry about my twenties, I was learnin' the ropes
I had a tendency of thinkin' about it after I spoke
We're experiencin' life through the postmodern lens
Oh, call it like it is
You're makin' an aesthetic out of not doin' well
And minin' all the bits of you
You think you can sell whilst the fans are on
Whimsical, political
Liberal, with young people as collateral
You see, I can't sleep 'cause the American Dream
Has been buying up all of my self-esteem
While QAnon created a legitimate scene
But it was just some bloke in the Philippines
And it's about time
(And it's about time)
(This is what it looks like)
(And it's about time)
(And it's about time)
(This is what it looks like)
(This is what it looks like)
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're livin' and you're seventeen
