Song Name: For You
I'm getting too comfortable in my skin again
Laughing too loudly at my own jokes again
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Need to stifle my voice again
Need to make myself small again
So that I can fit in the palms of your hands
So that I can be loved again
Shove a sock down my throat again
Remind me I'm not funny again
Be the cool girl you wanted everyone to see
In high school, I wanted everything but me
But pardon me, I've overshared
I'll back myself into this corner
I'll hide my tail between my legs
It's really for the best
And I'll be quiet for you
And I'll make room here for you
I'll throw out my things and ignore the constant sting
Shove your keys on my ring
And I'll ask, "How are things?"
For you
For you
For you
For you
