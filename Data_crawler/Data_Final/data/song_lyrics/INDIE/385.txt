Song Name: in your neighbours garden
I don't mind if you're running around chasing her
Just leave me out of it
Don't bother me no more
I don't mind as long as you leave me out of your life
Leave me out of it
I want no part of it
I'm tryna be a better me
So leave me growing
Like the roses in your neighbour's garden
I don't mind if you're running around chasing her
Just leave me out of it
I want no part of it
I don't blame you for moving on with your life
I'm tryna do the same
Let me do the same
I'm tryna be a better me
So leave me growing
Like the roses in your neighbour's garden
I'm tryna be a better me
So leave me growing
Like the roses in your neighbour's garden
