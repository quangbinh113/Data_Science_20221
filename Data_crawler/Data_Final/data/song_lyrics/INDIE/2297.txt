Song Name: Sweet Jane - Full Length Version; 2015 Remaster
Standin' on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, Janey's in her vest
And me, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band
Riding that Stutz Bearcat Jim
You know, those were different times
All the poets they studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
I'll tell you somethin' Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And both of them save their moneys
And when, when they come home from work
Sittin' down by the fire
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids, you can hear Jack say
Get ready, uh
Sweet Jane, c'mon baby now
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Some people they like to go out dancing
And other people, they have to work, just watch me now
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villans always blink their eyes
You know children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
But, anyone who ever had a heart
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
They wouldn't turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her, hey, when she smiles
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
