Song Name: CAN'T GET OVER YOU (feat. Clams Casino)
I can't get over you
Can't get over you
And before I die, I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can
Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me to the nightlife?
Baby, I like more curves like
But I want you, and I don't know right
(Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm out for you
I can't get over you
Can't get over you
And before I die, I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can
