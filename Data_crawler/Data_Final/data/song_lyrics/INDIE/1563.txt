Song Name: Pool House
This song's called "Dugout" ("Pool House")
"Pool House" - this song is called "Pool House"
Waiting around for something to change my mood
'Cause I know that what's in these plastic cups isn't going to
Kids on the lawn stuck in pairs of two
Your lunch is on its way back up
But you're still in the pool
Wait inside
I'll be fine
I guess I'll sit outside
While you change your mind
I'll risk it all to find a place where I can hear my thoughts
Song's playing too loud
But upstairs they're still making out
I'm getting all choked up
I guess it's just my luck
And I'm stuck on the porch
What am I waiting for?
Wait inside
I'll be fine
I guess I'll sit outside
While you change your mind
Wait inside
I'll be fine
Wait inside
Change your mind
Oh honey, change your mind
