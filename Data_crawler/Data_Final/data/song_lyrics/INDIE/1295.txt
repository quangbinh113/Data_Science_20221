Song Name: Slacks
Got a piece of my mind to tell you who's mine
Nobody hurts like me for you
Soft slacks at night, I'm wearing 'em tight
Nobody hurts like I do
Your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine
So stop feeding me, "A little more time"
Your shit's a mess, I'm not yours to undress
I'm leaving this love for the last time
I'm not yours, I'm mine
You've got the means to caress
But weak you leave me a mess
One touch is enough, your hands a little too rough
(Your hands a little too rough, your hands a little too rough)
Will I ever be enough?
I'm not yours, I'm mine
I'm not yours
We fall the fader to black
Release the ropes and feel the slack
I'm not yours, I'm mine
I tell you every time you're walking a fine, fine line
I'm not yours, I'm mine
I'm not yours
Heard it all before
I'm not yours
Heard it all before
I'm not yours
Heard it all before
I'm not yours
Heard it all before
I'm not yours
