Song Name: Love Fade
Tender heart
Tender sea
In the sun
We can't descend
Under citylights
A silver ring
On the sea
Enough to say
I fade
I, love fade
As the sun rise
Warstruck wine
Washed this skin
Diamond pointed light
Across their backs
I fade
I, love fade
As the sun rise
I fade
I, love fade
As the sun descends
