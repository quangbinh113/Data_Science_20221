Song Name: Pick U Up
Never went to college, leave your comments in the message box
He walks like Elvis Presley 'cause his Bentley cost a million bucks
She's hanging out the window and she's saying my name (Say my name)
Her head out of the window and she's saying my name
I have a talent for discretion, I make a good impression
As everybody's playing the game (What's that?)
Hey there, did you call me?
Are you lonely?
Should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money?
Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?

There must be something in the water
I honestly can't be bothered to spin around in circles like this
Well these veteran social climbers, their ambition and desires
A cocktail of charm and explicit pics
She's out the window and she's saying my name (Say my name)
Her head out of the window and she's saying my name (Ahuh)
Oh, well, my god this is a tough one, she'll take my breath and then some
At least I'll leave this world with a final thrill (Hey)
Hey there, did you call me?
Are you lonely?
Should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money?
Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?
I'm changing my position if you're
Thinking what I'm thinking, yeah it's not allowed
It's a funny situation when your
Man's out on vacation, yeah I'm ducking out
Feel the love
Yeah, we'll take you where we can in the city of angels
Do you feel the love?
Yeah, we'll take you where we can, take you so many places
(All these beautiful faces)
Hey there, did you call me?
Well should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money?
Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?
(Oh you love me now, haha)
