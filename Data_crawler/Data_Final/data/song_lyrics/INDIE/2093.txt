Song Name: Time Baby III
Sometimes it rains inside my head
And the words run dry
Now, Walls of breathing hands are reaching up
To touch my thigh
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
Sometimes it's bright inside my head
Except the back of my eyes
And hands of breathing walls are reaching up
'Cause that's the time we lie
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
No, they don't have to take you away
