Song Name: Not Into You
Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not-
You're sitting, waiting beside your phone
The apple of your eye
The one you love is awake, you're alone
And you can't help but realize
That you waste your time
Tell yourself a lie
That you waste your time
Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not-
I love ya
(And I) can't stop thinking of ya
(Oh, and I) love you
I can't stop thinking of ya, of ya
Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
