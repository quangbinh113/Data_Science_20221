Song Name: Call U Tomorrow
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Hear me out
Maybe this is, is
The death of us
I'm crying out
God, hear my prayer
Maybe there's no ending us
You hear our cry
And if I mean something
If I still mean something to you
I'm still here
And if I mean something
If I still mean something to you
I'm still here
So, can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow? (I don't really wanna speak to you no more, yeah, yeah)
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
