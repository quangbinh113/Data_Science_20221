Song Name: About You
I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads

Something to do while we try to recall how we met

Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
You and I (don't let go) were alive (don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let g)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
There was something 'bout you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning
I never know what to think about
I think about you (so don't let go)
About you (so don't let go)
Do you think I have forgotten
About you? (Don't let go)
About you
About you
Do you think I have forgotten
About you? (Don't let go)
