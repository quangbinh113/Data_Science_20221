Song Name: Famous
One day we'll all be famous
They'll be knowing what our name is
Driving them fast cars
Swiping them gold cards
Bring us the cheque we'll pay this
Whatever the price of fame is
Baby we gon' be famous, famous
I got it made, gonna top the charts
Be the Hollywood sign be a big star
Legacy, on the boulevard
Take another picture, give a little more
No stress just gotta make myself
Be a best seller waiting on a shelf
I say it'll be worth it when I can do it my way 'erday
Just wanna call out the haters
On a Kanye basis with fierceness
So we wouldn't have to care
'Bout what they say anymore
One day we'll all be famous
They'll be knowing what our name is
Driving them fast cars
Swiping them gold cards
Bring us the cheque we'll pay this
Whatever the price of fame is
Baby we gon' be famous, famous
I got it made, followers ten mil
But as I turn around ain't nobody being real
All the pain, hidden between thrills
Feelin' so busy I forget how I feel
We can take it slow, just post another photo
We'll be raking in the likes like it makes us feel alright, right?
Hash tagging blessings on blessings
And only stressing 'bout filters
Hash bragging endless vacations
And quote inspirations
I thought I was me but i'm just combinations
'Cause who wants to be themselves
When you can be someone else?
One day we'll all be famous
They'll be knowing what our name is
Driving them fast cars
Swiping them gold cards
Bring us the cheque we'll pay this
Whatever the price of fame is
Baby we gon' be famous, famous
One day we'll all be famous
They'll be knowing what our name is
Driving them fast cars
Swiping them gold cards
Bring us the cheque we'll pay this
Whatever the price of fame is
Baby we gon' be famous, famous
One day we'll all be famous
They'll be knowing what our name is
Driving them fast cars
Swiping them gold cards
Bring us the cheque we'll pay this
Whatever the price of fame is
Baby we gon' be famous, famous
(On day we'll all be famous)
