Song Name: Unknown Song
Through the years I have learned
How you conquered my world
Upsetting waterfalls
When we were falling in love
Love's the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my bloodstream obviously
You're a haunting melody
I tried to forget
You know memories
I'm still on the run
I'm begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to get control?
Will I ever know?
You corroding my soul
Your friends are gone and now
You're fucked up by yourself
They leave you all alone
And now you're on your own
Your friends are gone and now
You're fucked up by yourself
They leave you all alone
And now you're on your own
Through the years I have learned
How you conquered my world
Upsetting waterfalls
When we were falling in love
Love's the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my bloodstream obviously
You're a haunting melody
I tried to forget
You know memories
I'm still on the run
I'm begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to get control?
Will I ever know?
You corroding my soul
Your friends are gone and now
You're fucked up by yourself
They leave you all alone
And now you're on your own
Your friends are gone and now
You're fucked up by yourself
They leave you all alone
And now you're on your own
