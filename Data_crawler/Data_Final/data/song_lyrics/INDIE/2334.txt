Song Name: Lost on You
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?

Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And will you know
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Ho, ooh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Ooh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Ho, ooh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Hoooooh
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Wishin' I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around
Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Ho, oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Ooh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Ho, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Hoooooh
Is that lost on you?
Hoooooh
Ooh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Ho, oh
Tell me are they lost on you
Ooh, oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Ho, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
