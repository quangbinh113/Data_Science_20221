Song Name: I Love You So
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've gotta get away and let you go, I've gotta get over
But I love you so (ooh-ooh)
I love you so (ooh-ooh)
I love you so (ooh-ooh)
I love you so (ooh-ooh)
I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So, please let me go
But I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so
