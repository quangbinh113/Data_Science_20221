Song Name: What Once Was
I guess I knew this would happen to you
Inside I did, but I refuse to know the truth
I'm heading back inside to sit at home with you
I think I know what's wrong

My friends put on their bravest face
Their tales between their legs, something's out of place
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face
Keep your mouth zipped, son
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hanging on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was
Tell me all important stuff
What's your favorite colour?
What makes you so tough?
Please don't let go when you've had enough
I'm on my knees

Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hanging on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hanging on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was
Waiting for my love
Waiting for-
