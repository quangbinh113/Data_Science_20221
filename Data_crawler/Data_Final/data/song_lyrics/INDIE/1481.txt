Song Name: Ben Franklin
Part two feels like spring
All on my own
Guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew how I'd take it
You brought her to flex
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really try
And damn, this time I really tried
Lived on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain for–µver
But you said you'd die
Said you would've died for me
Raise your voice to me
Second time, I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you never met me
I never should've hurt you, I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would've died for me
