Song Name: No Name
Every now and then I see a part of you I've never seen
Birds can swim and fish can fly, the road is long, no wonder why
One of these days you'll realize what you mean to me, oh
Every now and then I see a part of you I've never seen
Every now and then I try to tell you just how I feel
Heavens talk, the rain begins, the sky turns black, nobody wins
Well, I try to talk, but I can't
My soul has turned to steel
This happens every now and then when I try to tell you just how I feel
So, if you ever love somebody
You gotta keep them close
When you lose grip of their body
You'll be falling
'Cause I'm falling
Deeper in love, in love
Deeper in love, in love
Deeper in love, in love
Deeper in love, in love
In love
