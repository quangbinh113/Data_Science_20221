Song Name: hungover sunday
Stuck in your room, it's half-past noon
Hungover Sunday with nothing to do, to do
The blinds are drawn, the sun's coming through
Shines on your face, what a beautiful view
No, I'm not leaving soon
'Cause I drank too much and I feel kinda funny
I can't get up, girl, I'd rather do nothing with you
Nothing with you
And there's not too much I planned today
So let's stay in, we can get away, just us two
Girl, me and you
On this Hungover Sunday, woah
Hungover Sunday, oh, oh-oh
We know how this goes
We been here before
Roll out of bed just to roll up some more
No, I don't need plans with you
Just look at our clothes all on the floor
Turn on some music, babe, and lock the door
Yeah, I drank too much and I feel kinda funny
I can't get up, girl, I'd rather do nothing with you
Nothing with you
And there's not too much I planned today
So let's stay in, we can get away, just us two
Girl, me and you
On this Hungover Sunday, woah
Hungover Sunday, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, I drank too much and I feel kinda funny
I can't get up, I'd rather do nothing with you, girl
Nothing with you, girl
And there's not too much I planned today
So let's stay in, we get away, just us two
Girl, me and you
On this Hungover Sunday, woah, ooh
Hungover Sunday, woah, oh
