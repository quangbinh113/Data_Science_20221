Song Name: Moonlight Shawty
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
She's a goddess
A wish from star in my heart, oh, yeah
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
Dance with me and I'll sing to you in my heart, oh, yeah
Yeah, and we can just dance in the moonlight
And these are the times that it feels right
And when I'm with you I do not hide
You're the light to the night, you're my moonlight
You're the light to the night, you're my moonlight
Let's go to the park and we'll fly a kite
You can come with me and I won't bite
And if I be late, baby, hold tight
I'm hugging you, holding you, cold nights
You're my weakness girl, you're my Kryptonite
You can come with me and you won't fight
As long as you be my bright light
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
Dance with me and I'll sing to you in my heart, oh, yeah
Dance with me and I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
She's a goddess
A wish from star in my heart, oh, yeah
