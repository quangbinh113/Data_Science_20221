Song Name: feel u
I said I loved you, I didn't lie
Now how you gonna go in and out my life?
I'm thinkin' that we're goin', we go out
We get in my car, we're goin'
62 in 55 (yeah, yeah)
I want you right by my side (yeah, yeah)
Kiss and touch your lips tonight (yeah, yeah)
Girl on girl, we lovin' right
Tell me what you want tonight
Feel you soft, I feel you all
We get into the bed, let me help you take it off
Feelin' all, feelin' right
Tell me what you want baby, I'll get it right
Just so that you know you are a keeper, I need ya
Feelin' in my stomach gettin' deeper and deeper
Skin, touch
Skin, lie
Gettin' really close, so I can see your eyes
Skin, touch
Skin, lie
Gettin' really close so I can see your eyes
I feel you soft, I feel you all
We get into the bed, let me help you take it off
Feelin' all, feelin' right
Tell me what you want baby, I'll get it right
Just so that you know you are a keeper, I need ya
Feelin' in my stomach gettin' deeper and deeper
Skin, touch
Skin, lie
Gettin' really close so I can see your eyes
Skin, touch
Skin, lie
Gettin' really close so I can see your eyes
