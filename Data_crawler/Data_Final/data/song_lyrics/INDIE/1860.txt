Song Name: AHH!!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
1 2 3 4!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
My head is like a washing machine
Tried to wash away these thoughts, still can't get clean
Round and round and round, my brain is still spinning
I might need rehab, cause I overdosed on overthinking
They're telling me to quit
But I need my next fix
But I'm broken with it
I know I've gotta quit
But I can't resist
Overthinking every little thing
Any thing
And it makes me go
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
I need to stop over thinking
My head
My head
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHH!
I need to stop overthinking
