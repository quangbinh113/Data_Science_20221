Song Name: I'm Not Enough and I'm Sorry
I'm done feeling worthless, imperfect
You hit me where it hurts
You put the blade right on my wrist
And slit until it spurts out blood, red, dead
That's just how I'm feeling
You tell me that you love me
But there you go leaving, why you so surprised?
You're a demon in disguise
These past two weeks all I been doing is crying
Tired of putting all my effort, but never receiving
You tell me I'm a piece of shit and that I really feel it
I'm not enough and I'm sorry
I really love you and I'm sorry
I struggle at showing and I'm sorry
You pretend to smile and I'm sorry
No, no, no
I'm done feeling worthless, imperfect
You hit me where it hurts
You put the blade on my wrist
And slit until it spurts out blood, red, dead
That's just how I'm feeling
You tell me that you love me
But there you go leaving, why you so surprised?
You're a demon in disguise
These past two weeks all I been doing is crying
Tired of putting all my effort, but never receiving
You tell me I'm a piece of shit and that I really feel it
I'm not enough and I'm sorry
I really love you and I'm sorry
I struggle at showing and I'm sorry
You pretend to smile and I'm sorry
No, no, no
No, no, no
