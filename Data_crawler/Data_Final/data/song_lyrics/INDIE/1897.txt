Song Name: GROWING PAINS
One, two, three
Hit it
Why do you turn your back to me
When I'm alone?
When I need you the most
Why do you turn your back to me?
When I'm alone
I need you the most
One, two, three
I don't know who you are
I'm living alone
Better for me
I'm on schedule
And I don't miss
Don't be so bold
Like it was a moment
Get some boba, baby
Don't hit me lonely
Whatever song is looping
In your head I don't hear at all
No, no, no, no
You're the movie star
In your moody heart
And I can't play the part
Like you were always trying to do to me
I see that (Ooh ooh)
Why do you turn your back to me
When I'm alone?
When I need you the most
Why do you turn your back to me
When I'm alone?
I need you the most
(Why do you turn?)
Begging you baby, don't let me down
Love like the eyes of a serpent now
Why do you turn
Why do you turn
Turn your back to me?
(Talking to me)
