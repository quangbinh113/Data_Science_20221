Song Name: I Like You
I am scared to say I miss you
Last time I had you I should have kissed you
These feelings fester up inside
But how could I deny these butterflies?
I hope I'm not stuck on your waiting list
'Cause I dream of you in colors that don't exist
And I think it's high time for you to know
I like you, I like you, I like you
And I hope you like me too
You've been there through all I've been through
Kept me sane and held my hand too
The way you make me feel alright
So how could I deny your lips on mine?
I hope I'm not stuck on your waiting list
'Cause I dream of you in colors that don't exist
And I think it's high time for you to know
I like you, I like you, I like you
And I hope you like me too
I am scared to say I miss you
Last time I had you I should have kissed you
These feelings fester up inside
But how could I deny these butterflies?
