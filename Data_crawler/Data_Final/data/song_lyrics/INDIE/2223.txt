Song Name: Come Down and Waste With Me
Hold out
Ill be right there
Feel like I've been only
Inside where I hold it
Good find while I call
How long are you waiting?
Tell that I've been off
Look by, under-felt
Good for making more
Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me
And Im so tired I'm barely here at all
So un-required the feelings I control
On the side, I never want to know
Goodbye
Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me
Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me
