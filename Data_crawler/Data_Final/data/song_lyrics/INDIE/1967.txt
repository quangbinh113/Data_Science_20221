Song Name: Smoke Signals
I went with you up to the place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to Walden it with you
Any longer it would've got old
Singin' "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s alright
I'm sleepin' in my bed again and gettin' in my head
And then walk around the reservoir
You, you must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach
One of your eyes is always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then and I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead
And you must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach
I wanna live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checkin' out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you ridin' shotgun, speeding 'cause fuck the cops
And you, you must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach, mmm
I buried a hatchet, it's comin' up lavender
The future's unwritten, the past is a corridor
I'm at the exit, lookin' back through the hall
You are anonymous, I am a concrete wall
