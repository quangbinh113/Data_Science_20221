Song Name: she knows it
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
I think I'm in love, you're like my twin flame
You and I, we're perfectly aligned, it drives me insane
That he gets to call you mine
When he don't get your brain like I do
Yeah, it's like ecstasy
When you're next to me
Think that you should leave him
And stay with mе
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get hеr out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
What about the things you said that he does?
And how every day with him is like some fight club
We had an instant connection when it took you two months
Yeah, we had more fun
Yeah, it's like ecstasy
When you're next to me
Think that you should leave him
And stay with me
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
You seem lonely and it's so damn cruel
'Cause you're so back and forth like you're striking a chord
And then leading me on when you know that it's wrong
In denial, everybody sees it but you
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
I like a girl that's got a boyfriend
Can't seem to get her out of my head
And she knows it should be me in her bed
Yeah, she knows it, she knows it, she knows it
She knows it, she knows it, she knows it
