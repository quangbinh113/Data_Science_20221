Song Name: dad
When I close my eyes
There's no compromise
It's made up of me
Everything I see
When it's out of reach
Swimming far too deep
Feeling like the brink
Please don't let me sink
I'm moving
In these moments, I'm losing

And it's proving
That I shouldn't be choosing
Choosing you
Turn off the radio
I don't wanna know
Who's in Hell today
Don't wanna feel this way
Wish that I was small
Where the grass felt tall
Hiding on my own
Dad, come take me home
I'm moving
In these moments, I'm losing

And it's proving
That I shouldn't be choosing
Choosing you
And these moments won't wait for me
(All my life)
And I'm tired of trying to be
(In your eyes)
I'm moving
In these moments, I'm losing

And it's proving
That I shouldn't be choosing
Choosing you
