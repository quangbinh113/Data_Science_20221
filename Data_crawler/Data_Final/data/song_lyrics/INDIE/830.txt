Song Name: I Hear a Symphony
I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
Now in it's place is something new
I hear it when I look at you
With simple songs I wanted more
Perfection is so quick to bore
You are more beautiful by far
Our flaws are who we really are
I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
You took my broken melody
And now I hear a symphony
Ah-ah oh-ooh-oh ah-ah
And now I hear a symphony
