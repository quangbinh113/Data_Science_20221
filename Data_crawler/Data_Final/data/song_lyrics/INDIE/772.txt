Song Name: Medusa
There's blood in the water
And they're coming to bring me down
What's hope with no savior
Yeah, there's no one in this ghost town
She looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
And I crumbled to pieces
My body, my weakness is on the floor
And the wind will blow and blow
And I won't be here no more
My wishing well has run dry
Stars are dying in the sky
So I'll shed my blood and tears
I'll show no fear just to survive
She looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Oh Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
Ahh, ahh
Ahhhh
She says, mortal one you've been chosen
You're beautiful, but you're broken
So hold on to this moment
And fight until you're hopeless
There's secrets and riddles
That live in these walls
There's ghosts of past heroes
And I hear them call my name
We won't be tamed
Oh, she looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
She looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Oh Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
Ahh, ahh
Ahhhh
Ahh, ahh
Ahhhh
