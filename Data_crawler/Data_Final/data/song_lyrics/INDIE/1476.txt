Song Name: All I Need
She's all I need, she's something special
Can't stop her now, won all the medals
She takes me to another level
I can't let go
Just can't get enough
Notice she's doing fine, no problems, not thinking about this
Funny 'cause I'm just tryna forget all this shit
But then again, then again
I can't, I can't
Just learned to fly but don't know how to land
Should say what I wanna say
So we can take this off my mind and move on with the day (okay?)
She's all I need, she's something special
Can't stop her now, won all the medals
She takes me to another level
I can't let go
Maybe I'm delusional
Maybe I've been up too long
Or maybe I'm still asleep in a dream
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up
I guess I like the feeling when it's bitter sweet
And I don't mind just chilling at the party
But I would rather hang out with your body
We could stay up too long and get wavy
She's all I need, she's something special
Can't stop her now, won all the medals
She takes me to another level
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
But I just can't get enough
