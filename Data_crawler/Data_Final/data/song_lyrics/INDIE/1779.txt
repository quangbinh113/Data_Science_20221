Song Name: I Want To Be With You
Swimming in my t-shirts
No matter the weather
Say what you mean
I want to be with you
I see you in the water
Straps on your glasses
Say what you mean
I want to be with you
I can't take it
I want what's right in front of me
I can't fake this
Say what you mean
I want to be with you
I know my shit's weird
And I live in the suburbs
And it's almost unnatural how lame I act around you
Give me a chance
To say what I mean
Please do the same
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
You shut my mouth
And you buckle my knees
My princess please
You know it's all I want to do
So I'll get over my head
And I'll make my bed
'Cause darling, you'rе the one
And fuck, I want you
'Cause darling, you'rе the one
You know I want you
You know you're the one
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
And fuck I want you
