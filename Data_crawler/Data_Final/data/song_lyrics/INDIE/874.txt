Song Name: .
When I see you with her
It only gets worse
And, oh, how it hurts
I can't say 'cause I'm all out of words
Lost on this earth
Just floating around
Someone help me down
It's been so hard ever since you broke my heart
But I'll never tell
Honey, I'm not doing so well
It's not your fault
I could've done more like being upfront

Honest about what I want
But it's not like me to just say what I feel
Though I feel it, it's real
Oh-oh
It's been so hard ever since you broke my heart
But I'll never tell
Honey, I'm not doing so well
Honey, I'm not doing so well
Honey, I'm not doing so well
Oh, I'll never tell
Honey, I'm not doing so well
I'm not doing so well
