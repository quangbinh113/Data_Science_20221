Song Name: Demons and Monsters
Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Ya, yeah
World over ran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah my thoughts always wander
Lost in my head, yeah my thoughts always wander
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
People in charge are just really the robbers
World overran by the demons and monsters
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
Chasing these demons that wasted my time
Monsters be chattin' inside of my mind
Baby, I love you, but don't text my line
You just distract me when I'm tryna shine
Bullets to people that causin' me pain
Losin' myself, yeah, I'm mentally drained
And you brought me sun whenever it rained
And now you're a stranger I see random days
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
You got me runnin' in circles
Scribbles inside of my journal
Your beauty is what had me stare though
But you got me jumpin' these hurdles
World overran by the demons and monsters (Yuh)
People in charge are just really the robbers (Ayy)
Fall into evil corrupt for the dollars (Ayy)
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander (I'm sayin')
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
Smokin' green and doin pottery, to get into the lottery
No money but the property, a simple piece of poverty
We all need some modesty, equal forms of quantity
And I might cause a robbery
To steal back all the ease of mind that's taken by society
I'ma need sobriety
Addicted to the things that ran me down, man, what an irony
But always suffer silently, building up this rivalry
Cut it up, then toss it, people smiling, like, "Finally, they gone"
All of my thoughts gonna wander, yeah
Lost in a search for a dollar, yeah
The good people turn into robbers, and
I'm hiding from demons and monsters, and
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
