Song Name: Can't Stand It
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super fucking cute
And I can't stand that
I've been searching for
A girl that's just like you
'Cause I know
That your heart is true
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand that
Let's sell all our shit
And run away to sail the ocean blue
Then you'll know
That my heart is true, yeah!
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand that
You, you got me where you want me
'Cause I'll do anything to please you
Just to make it through another year
You, I saw you 'cross the room
And I knew that this was gonna blossom
Into something beautiful
You're beautiful
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand that
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand that
And I can't stand that (I love you baby, I love you)
No I can't stand that (I love you baby, I love you)
