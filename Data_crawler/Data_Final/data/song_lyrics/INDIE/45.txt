Song Name: prom dress
I'm nearing the end of my fourth year
I feel like I've been lacking, crying too many tears
Everyone seemed to say, it was so great
But did I miss out? Was it a huge mistake?
I can't help the fact I like to be alone
It might sound kinda sad, but that's just what I seem to know
I tend to handle things usually by myself
And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the Prom Queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
Now I'm sitting on the floor and all I want to do is run
I keep collections of maps upon my wall
To try to stop myself from revealing it all
Affecting others is the last thing I would do
I keep to myself though I want to break through
I hold so many small regrets
And what if is down inside my head
Some confidence it couldn't hurt me
My demeanor is often misread
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the Prom Queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
Now I'm sitting on the floor and all I want to do is run
All I wanna do is run
All I wanna do is run
All I wanna do is run
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the Prom Queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
Now I'm sitting on the floor and all I want to do is run
All I wanna do is run
