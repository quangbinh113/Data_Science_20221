Song Name: Supalonely
I know I f- up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic
I'm a sad girl, in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends
Know what's happened
You're a bad thing
I know I f- up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely chic)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Supalonely)
Now I'm in the bathtub, cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking, bubbles in my eyes
Now maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club, just tryna get a backrub (Lonely)
I'm a sad girl, in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends
Know what's happened
You're a bad thing
I know I f- up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Woo)
Lonely (I'm a lonely chic)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Supalonely)
I loathe romancing in itself, yeah I'd be damned to try
I'm only dancin' by myself, so I don't slam my eyelids, but
Compostable cups, pop a penny, I-I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up
But my boogie still stays freshless as-
I know I f- up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely chic)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Supalonely)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (I've been lonely, I've been lonely)
(I've been lonely, by the way)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I've been lonely)
