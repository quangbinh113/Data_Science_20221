Song Name: SO WHAT!
These thoughts in my head take control
But when I'm down, I beg for more
I beg for more
And I've been thinking about you all night
I don't wanna fight
All these other random girls wanna kill my vibe, yeah
What a waste of time
So what I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are choking
I'm so over life
So what I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight
Exhausted, it's toxic
You took a line and crossed it
Don't miss me, you're busy
It sucks that you're so pretty
Walk out my door and you're driving away
PTSD leaving me in my grave
I'm not okay
So what I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are choking
I'm so over life
So what I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight
She said it's all my fault, it's all mine
She said it's all my fault, it's all mine
She said it's all my fault, it's all mine
She said it's all my fault, it's all mine
So what I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are choking
I'm so over life
So what I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight
