Song Name: How Was Your Day?
How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Forgotten how you used to smile
What do you look like?
Remember when we used to fight?
And I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new
'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then, you're the best that I've had
Call me up late
Say it's okay
'Cause I'll be away for a while
I can't remember your smile
You used to kiss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new
'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had
'Cause even when we're miles away, I know
You'll still want me as usual
But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you
How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Remember when we used to smile
You used to miss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That things have to change like the weather and the days
But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you
