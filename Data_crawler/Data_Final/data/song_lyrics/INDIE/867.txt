Song Name: Destroy Myself Just For You
Maybe it'll last
Maybe it'll last this time
I'm gonna die one day
I know it, I know it
There's no surprise to this pain
Destroyin', destroyin', destroy
I destroy myself just for You, You
I destroy myself just for You, You
I
Maybe it'll last this time
Feel like I'ma crash
I hang up on the cross for You
I would give it all for You
I'm gonna die one day
Destroy myself just for You, You
I
Pray my salvation makes it to the pearly gates
Bring the suffering that I face
All the things that I face
Destroy myself just to wait for You
(I destroy myself just for You, You) ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
1 Samuel 7:3
And Samuel said to all the house of Israel
"If you are returning to the Lord with all your heart
Then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you
And direct your heart to the Lord and serve him only
He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines"
So the people put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth
And they served the Lord only
