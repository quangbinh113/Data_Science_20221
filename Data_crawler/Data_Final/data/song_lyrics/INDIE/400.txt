Song Name: Comfort Crowd
This hurt that I'm holding's getting heavy
But I'ma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty
Begging on my knees
Screamin', "Someone come and help me"
But by the time they're there
I've already hid the body
My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady
Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly
Telling you I'm fine
I don't really need nobody
But you say through a sigh
That I said that lie already
I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd
Comfort crowd
We rot, thinkin' lots about nothing
Yeah, I could spend a lifetime
Sitting here talkin'
And even if I cry all over your body
You don't really mind
Say you like your shirt soggy
Yeah, I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd
Comfort crowd
We mess around
And laugh too loud
And make the sounds
We try to hide when people are around
By blood we're bound
Through ups and downs
Their smiles and pouts
Comfort crowd
You can always count
Yeah, I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd
