Song Name: The Cut That Always Bleeds
I don't love you anymore
A pretty line that I adore
Five words that I've heard before
'Cause you keep me on a rope
And tied a noose around my throat
You're gone, then back at my door
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doin' when you're comin' back
And I don't wanna have another heart attack
Oh, I can't be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
Say you love somebody new
Then beat my heart to black and blue
Then they leave, and it's me you come back to (Ah-ah)
To say you loved me all along
And kiss the bruises 'til they're gone
Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe inside your arms
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute bleedin' from my back
'Cause I don't have another one for you to stab
And I don't wanna have another heart attack
Oh, I can't be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) But even though you're killing me, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need you like the air I breathe
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need, I need you more than me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need you more than anything
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Please, please
'Cause I could be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I could be anything you need
As long as you don't leave
The cut that always
