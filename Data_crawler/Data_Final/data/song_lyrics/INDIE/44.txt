Song Name: Falling for U
I was hangin' with you and then I realized
I didn't think it was true, I was surprised
When I found out I've fallen for you

I didn't wanna believe my feelings for you
I didn't wanna believe that I could lose you
If I told you just how I felt
But I can't help it
I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it
'Cause I'm stuck on you
And it might be pathetic and you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you
Please tell me, boy
Can you get a clue?
Or come through 'cause I just want to be with you
I'm scared
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe it's better if I just try to conceal the truth
For me and, for you
But I'm still stuck on you, ooh, ooh
I, I'm still falling for you
For you
