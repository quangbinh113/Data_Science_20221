Song Name: madhouse
Home, home sweet home
Live, laugh, love
These are somethings written by the phone
On the wall of this home
Located on nowhere avenue
Don't understand how everyone lives inside their head
Multi-colored ornaments in people's houses make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that's half the battle baby
Continental condiments in peoples houses make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
Memes, beauty dreams, self-help schemes
These are some things I can sit and read
Every dark, every tweet
Reckons with the different same old time
Confused in tide
While everyone powers on with life
Multi-colored ornaments in people's houses make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that's half the battle baby
Continental condiments in peoples houses make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
(Home sweet home, live laugh love)
(Home sweet home, live laugh love)
Multi-colored ornaments in people's houses make me feel like
I'm the only one who's out here
Everybody feels like that kid
Continental condiments in people's houses make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
(Welcome to the madhouse, baby)
