Song Name: It Could Be Nice
Closely
Closely
Closely
Closely
Tell me the truth (closely)
Do you love it?
When I take control, you can choose (closely)
I can help you, but you want to go, you got a dude (closely)
Let me love you
Let me make you want to just smooch (closely)
But you lie
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say?
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say?
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say?
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say?
So put me in use (closely)
If you love it
Let me work it
And tell me about you (closely)
What's your burden?
Let me hold it
You're in a mood (closely)
Let me love it
Let me make you gold against blue (closely)
Closer, hmm, closer
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say? (Wouldn't you say)
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say? (Wouldn't you say)
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say? (Wouldn't you say)
It could be nice
Wouldn't you say? (Wouldn't you say)
