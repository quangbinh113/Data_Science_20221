Song Name: Cognitive Dissonance
Was it real or a dream?
Can I trust what I see?
When I'm torn at the seams
How can I make-believe?
The fabric of reality is strong enough to tether me
There's weightlessness in fantasy
Life's heavy, but it's gravity
Maybe I'm missing it, bliss is just ignorance
Cloaked as indifference, cognitive dissonance
When I lie up at night, truth isn't hard to find
Wake up and live with it, cognitive dissonance
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it cognitive dissonance?
Get too close, build a wall
Miss a friend, never call
Chase a wish through the trees
Turn my back, and it's chasing me (it's chasing me)
Oh, the fabric of reality is strong enough to tether me
There's weightlessness in fantasy
Life's heavy, but it's gravity
Maybe I'm missing it, bliss is just ignorance
Cloaked as indifference, cognitive dissonance
When I lie up at night, truth isn't hard to find
Wake up and live with it, cognitive dissonance
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it cognitive dissonance?
It was real and a dream
Tried to trust, couldn't see
That I'm torn, but it seems
Everyone is torn like me, so
Maybe I'm missing it, bliss is just ignorance
Cloaked as indifference, cognitive dissonance
When I lie up at night, truth isn't hard to find
Wake up and live with it, cognitive dissonance
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Dissonance, dissonance, dissonance, dissonance
Isn't it? Isn't it cognitive dissonance?
