Song Name: Picnic In The Rain
Follow me
Come beneath the street
'Cause I got you
Yeah, I got you
Hold your hair
Coming at the back
'Cause I got you
Yeah, I got you
Take me out today away
Even if the sky is grey
Our life gave it up to stay
For our picnic in the rain
Waited so long
After it all
And I got you
Yeah, I got you
Callin' my name
Over again
And I got you
Yeah, I got you
Take me out today away
Even if the sky is grey
Our life gave it up to stay
For our picnic in the rain
Take me out today away
Even if the sky is grey
And our life gave it up to stay
For our picnic in the rain
