Song Name: Earth to Jay
So what's out there worth pursuing?
My inner voice says don't change at all
So don't ask me what I'm doing
On a plane to a dumb festival
I'm not different but I'm not the same
Youth is a young man's game
Earth to Jay, you're not the first
One to get your ego hurt
It's something else every day
Welcome to outer space
Outer space
Oh, go home
Oh, go home
Earth to Jay, you're not the first
One to get your ego hurt
It's something else every day
Welcome to outer space
Outer space
Outer space
Earth to Jay, you're not the first
One to get your ego hurt
It's something else every day
Welcome to outer space
Outer space
