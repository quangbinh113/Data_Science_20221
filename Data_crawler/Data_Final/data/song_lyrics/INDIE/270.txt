Song Name: Clouds
O, o, o, oo
O, o, o, oo
I forget all my dreams
I forget everyones name I meet
I forget about time and space
But I can't stop thinking 'bout your face
I can't stop thinking 'bout your face
Clouds are rolling by
I open my mouth and I breathe them right in
All my thoughts slip away
But I can't stop thinking 'bout your face
I can't stop thinking 'bout your face
Oh, I won't stop
Til you knock on my door
Won't stop
Til you knock on my door
O, o, o, oo
O, o, o, oo, o
I forget this and that
I forget about the shit that doesn't matter
My memory could be erased
And I'd still be thinking 'bout your face
Oh, I won't stop
Til you knock on my door
Won't stop
Til you knock on my door
O, o, o, oo
O, o, o, hmm
O, o, o, oo
O, o, o, oo o
