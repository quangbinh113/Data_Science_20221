Song Name: Car Crash in G Major
I was driving when the airbag popped and knocked sense into me
I was crying when the shrapnel hit and cut out part of me
You were lying when the cop asked you about me
The car's on fire
With you inside
Who's to say what it means
Now your mom she is going to therapy
And your dad says you're a disappointment to me
I was drunk when I crawled out of the wreck and screamed
The car's on fire
With you inside
And that's okay with me
