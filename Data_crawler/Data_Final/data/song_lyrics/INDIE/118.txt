Song Name: Fangs
I don't want a hard life
You keep me hangin' on a thin line
Waiting for the good times
But I can't afford time
I'm young and rich and stupid
Easy prey for Cupid
Easy dirty money
Makin' dollars out of Juul Pods
Runnin' from a real job
Luckily, I'm lucky
Tonight you're looking lovely
So I guess I'm wondering
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Hiding from a headache
I'll move to Cali 'cause the earthquakes
Feel like a massage break
Everyday's a beach day
My life is like a vacay
Margarita Monday
Baby, be my next prey
I'll make you make me chocolate pancakes
Kiss me on my dumb face
Could it be I'm your taste?
Have you seen what hides on my face?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
Can you see my fangs?
