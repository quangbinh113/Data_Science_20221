Song Name: 4th of july
(Instrumental)
There was an earthquake on the fourth of july
Something inside you was
Shaken by that
Fireworks display over the mountainside
You couldn't get those swinging lights out of your mind
But don't cry, demolition baby
Always blowing it up
Getting so stuck
Both hands in the dirt
Well i heard they tore that factory down
Only thing that big you felt safe around the
Beauty in all that machinery
Pumping in all its autonomy
It calmed your mind
Showed you time
But don't cry demolition baby
Always blowing it up
Getting so stuck
I see you, digging a foundation
Waiting for the world to go by
So you might as well try
Both hands in the dirt so you might as well try
Both hands in the dirt (so you might as well try)
Both hands in the dirt (so you might as well try)
Both hands in the dirt (so you might as well try)
Both hands in the dirt
There was an earthquake on the fourth of july
Something inside you was
Shaken by that
Fireworks display over the mountainside
