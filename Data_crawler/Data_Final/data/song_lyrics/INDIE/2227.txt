Song Name: Damn I'm Tired
I say I'm sorry
Your arms still at your side
Wish I could see it in your eyes
Let's be honest
I'm not on your mind
And I don't wanna make you try
Damn, I'm tired
Of being nice
All it does is make me sad
I'm not gonna lie
I'm not gonna hide
And be someone else
Just to be loved all the time
Don't you worry
You can say you're sorry
I'll help you say it if you like
If love is the answer
I've got a question
If I'm not myself, who do you love?
Damn, I'm tired
Of being nice
All it does is make me sad
I'm not gonna lie
I'm not gonna hide
And bе someone elsе
Just to be loved all the time
I'm tired
I'm tired (I'm tired)
I'm tired (I'm tired)
I'm tired (I'm tired, ooh)
