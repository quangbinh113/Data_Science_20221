Song Name: I Got It
All these blessings fallin' in my lap like I'm a grandpa
All this money I go swimmin' in it like a tadpole
They say there's a bad side to the fame where they at though
My past niggas had themselves to blame how dem apples
Ye ain't want wahala from this Naija from the Delta
Did you want more flavor in the game yeah you're welcome
My level done changed I ain't the same and it's seldom
Anybody comin' at my name I'm to well done hеll yeah
Jeez, look at the cheese, look at thе ice, look at the wrist
Yea look at me
Can you believe the I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
I know you feel this heat
Comin' in hot, hundred degrees
Can you believe that I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
What you need
Baby I reign supreme
You say you want the fire, I got the kerosine
What is your sole desire
I'll take it to extreme
Know how to take you higher
Lets make a scene
Hey, hey, it's done, it's a wrap
What you wanna do back
We gone for a fact
Yeah we got what you lack
Sorry but it's over
Got no luck, no four leaf clover
Ya might fall out like it's October
I thought I already told ya
Jeez, look at the cheese, look at the ice, look at the wrist
Yea look at me
Can you believe the I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
I know you feel this heat
Comin' in hot, hundred degrees
Can you believe that I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
Big dog who you callin' bitches
Rushed in like it's college scrimmage
6 speed, tell me what's the limit
You better bow down to a goddess image
Nuh-uh, no you're not gonna try to swallow my shine
Nuh-uh, no you're not gonna tell me what isn't mine
Nuh-uh, play your part little one do not cross the line
Nuh-uh, feel the art and don't front you're wastin' my time
What a shame little bitter bitch
Couldn't stand to be outmatched so you threw a fit
You know I could have helped you just a little bit
I should have known better man you were full of shit
Now I'm done with it look at what you missed
Jeez, look at the cheese, look at the ice, look at the wrist
Yea look at me
Can you believe the I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
I know you feel this heat
Comin' in hot, hundred degrees
Can you believe that I got it
Better believe that I'll flaunt it, yeah, yeah
