Song Name: Line Without a Hook (feat. mxmtoon)
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand if no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Momma never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse and it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I found a way to kill the sound, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said
To make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Instrumental
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I know that you know
Listen close and move slow
I can't speak fast or else I'll crack
It's the price I pay for going back
And I've dreamed to be seen
Now I've got it, do I want it?
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said
To make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
I, I
Darling, when you're fast asleep
I feel your dreams begin to bleed
Saying, is it worth it? Is it worth it?
Tell me, is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
'Cause there is something
Then there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me
He's singing "She's a, she's a lady
And I am just a boy"
Singing "She's a, she's a lady
And I am just a line without a hook"
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Oh, was it something I said
To make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
