Song Name: Promises
Promise I made was to love myself
Sometimes I lie to myself
Where're you going?
No one knows
It was perfect in my head
Things are changing, but I'm still here
Wrote down these words
And it seems so clear
You was the one who said, "Believe in love"
We get closer, but not close enough
Why'd you have to leave?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Oh, I can't do this anymore
Why'd you have to leave?
Why'd you have to go?
Tell me that I meant something to you
Oh, I can't do this anymore
I wrote a letter to myself and it was full of promises
One for you and one for me
Love is not our enemy
I wrote a letter to myself and it was full of promises
One for you and one for me
Love is not our enemy
(Need some distance from you)
(I just disappoint you)
(Need some distance from you)
(I just disappoint you)
(Need some distance from you)
(I just disappoint you)
(Need some distance from you)
(I just disappoint you)
