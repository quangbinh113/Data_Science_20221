Song Name: i'm too pretty for this
He says this and he says that
He always says he wants me back
But I'm not blind to all his bull (mhm)
I've heard it all that you forgot
But you're just scared that you'll get caught
And I'm too good for you to lose
Why do your promises never stick?
And why are your words always full of shit?
And why don't you try just a little bit
When you say you want me so bad?
Oh, I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
Oh, I'm too pretty for this (ha-haa)
God, I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
He looks good and he seems nice
Until I gotta see the price
And that's a lot for me to pay, yeah
I've heard it all that I'm the one
But it's not you who had to run
But still expected me to stay
Why do your promises never stick?
And why are your words always full of shit?
And why don't you try just a little bit
When you say you want me so bad?
Oh, I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this (ha-haa)
God, I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna pull your weight
Want me back but it's too late
Never falling for a boy like you
I'm not dumb to all your bait
You and I were never fate
Pack your bags and take 'em to the blue
'Cause I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this (ha-haa)
God, I'm too pretty for this (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm too pretty for this
