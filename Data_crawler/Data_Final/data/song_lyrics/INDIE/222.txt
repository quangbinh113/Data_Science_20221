Song Name: sucks 4 u
I've been doing better since you haven't hit my phone up in a week or two
But next time that you're calling gonna call you out for lying like you always do
And every time that you come back around
You know I always end up on the ground
So don't tell me that you miss it
'Cause this time I'm not listening
Sucks for you, babe
I thought that you would kill me, but I'm okay
And every since you left me I've been
Busy with a new babe staying out late
Sucks for you, babe
You really thought that I was gonna sit and wait
For you to realize leaving was a mistake
But it's too late
What can I say?
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
I was drinking whiskey under colored lights and thinking I'd forget the times
You were selfish and so reckless, treating me like a possession, I said it was fine
You're saying that the silence is too loud
But I only care what's better for me now
So don't tell me that you miss it
'Cause this time I'm not listening
Sucks for you, babe
I thought that you would kill me, but I'm okay
And every since you left me I've been
Busy with a new babe staying out late
Sucks for you, babe
You really thought that I was gonna sit and wait
For you to realize leaving was a mistake
But it's too late
What can I say?
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you, babe
I thought that it would kill me, but I'm okay
And ever since you left me I've been
Busy with a new babe staying out late
Sucks for you, babe
You really thought that I was gonna sit and wait
For you to realize leaving was a mistake
But it's too late
What can I say?
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for you
Sucks for
