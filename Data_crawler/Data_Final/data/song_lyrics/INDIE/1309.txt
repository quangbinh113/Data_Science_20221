Song Name: Road Head
You gave road head
On a turnpike exit
Going home
Going home
Last ditch desperate
Like a makeshift cell phone
Pump and run
Pump and run
Pump and run
Pump and run
Dream on, baby
Were his last words to me
Dream on, baby
So dreaming baby
Took that corkscrewed highway
Lightless miles
Of big rigs
Lightless miles, miles and miles
