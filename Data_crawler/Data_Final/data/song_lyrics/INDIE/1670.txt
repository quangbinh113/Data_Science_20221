Song Name: Dancing with my phone
I'm just laying on the floor again
Can't be bothered to get up now
I wouldn't care
If I never get up again
I don't want to
Then our song comes on the radio
Makes me wanna start to dance
Oh, I wanna know
If you feel the same way as me
Why would you go?
Dancing, I'm all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
On my feet and now I'm out the door
Walking by the places that we used to go
I remember all your favorite stores
I won't lie
I don't think I even know myself anymore
You're the one who knew me fuckin' well
Yeah, you know
Dancing, I'm all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
Dancing I'm all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
Dancing all alone
Dancing all alone (I'm dancing all alone)
Dancing all alone
Dancing all alone (I'm dancing with my phone)
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
Dancing all alone
Dancing all alone
Dancing all alone
Dancing all alone (thinking about you)
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
