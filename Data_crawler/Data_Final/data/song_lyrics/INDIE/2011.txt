Song Name: Shake It Out
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
And I've been a fool, and I've been blind (I've been blind)
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa oh
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa oh
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off
Ooh whoa oh
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out, and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa oh
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa oh
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off
Ooh whoa oh (shake him off)
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back (shake it off)
But given half the chance, would I take any of it back? (Shake it off)
It's a fine romance, but it's left me so undone (shake it off)
It's always darkest before the dawn (shake it off)
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa oh
And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark, at the end of my road
And I'm ready to suffer, and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (oh whoa oh)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (oh whoa oh)
But what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen
To me, yeah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa oh
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa oh
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off
Oh whoa oh
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa oh
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa oh
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off
Oh whoa oh
