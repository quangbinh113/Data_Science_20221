Song Name: BAD FRUIT*
I'm just a little volcano in the nighttime
I can see the world burn under my fingertips
I'm just an apple, I'll fall when I turn ripe
Hit the floor hard, I was never picked
I'm just a little tornado in the sunshine
Click your heels, run on golden bricks
I'm just a little moon running from the sunrise
Make the waves crash, hide behind my only friend
I read every sign on some real shit, but I still trip over every line
On some real shit, it took a long time for me just to feel this
Working overtime, faking like we're fine, showing diligence
Acting like you're hard, but you're still a bitch (still a bitch)
Messing with my mind, what the pills did (fire)
Niggas press my line, hit the kill-switch
Niggas dying in the summertime, but I never trip
It wasn't one of mine, I'm heaven-sent
In my mother's eyes, everything I did
Kinda undefined, real deal, real spill
Fallin' off the vine when I was a little kid
Livin' on rewind, sunset
Some said it was my time, I ain't done yet
I'm a lil' volcano (volcano...), give me space (space...)
With my hand out the window (window...), bite the wave
