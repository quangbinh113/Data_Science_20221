Song Name: Understand
Will you be mine?
Do you wanna stay?
I understand your options girl
If you wanna go away
Will you be mine?
Will you love me 'til the end?
Do I stay on your mind like you do or am I just afraid?
And I know
That it's hard to choose
You're afraid of the things in your life that you might just lose
I want you to be mine
I wanna hold your hand
If all I have is tonight
Then I understand
