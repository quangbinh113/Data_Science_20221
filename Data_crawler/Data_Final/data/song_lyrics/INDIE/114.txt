Song Name: Maybe
Feel the weight, feel the space in the void of my own time
I'm surrounded in pain passed down through my bloodline
And I have tried to escape from the maze but it's no use
These chains never break, never budge, never come loose
The story's over
The story's over
Standing still and it feels like I'm lost in a coma
Inside, realize I'm at war in my own mind
It's a place for good days, I'll be here for a long time
You don't know where I've been, you weren't there on the front lines
The story's over
Maybe it's not over
Changing is found in motion
Maybe it's balanced with your moving
Could stopping bring you closer?
Maybe, tilts you over
Leaning into the same old story
Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe, ah, ah) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe, ah, ah) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe, ah, ah)
Maybe fear can't define all the walls 'til you enter
And even blood couldn't find who you are at the center
Could it be that you're more than the scars on the surface
As the heat is beneath all the ash of the embers
Crossing over
Crossing over
The way it's told, there's no more room to grow
The way it's told, there's no return, oh
Maybe it's not over
Changing is found in motion
Maybe it's balanced with your moving
Could stopping bring you closer?
Maybe, tilts you over
Leaning into the same old story
Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe, ah, ah) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe, ah, ah) Crossing over
(Maybe, ah, ah)
(Maybe)
