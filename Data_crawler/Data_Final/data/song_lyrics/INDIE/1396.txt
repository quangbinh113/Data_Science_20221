Song Name: Chaeri
Regrets, the things I should've said
Was I a bad friend who was only that bad with you?
I'm sorry, did you feel lonely?
I didn't realize back then it was really that bad for you
September started sweet, then winter got so mean
The fruit left on my sheets, if I could do it all again, I would've said
Chaeri, please, you're killing me
It's only that bad, it's only that bad
If you tell yourself you'll never get out of bed
Chaeri, please, you're killing me
It's only that bad, it's only that bad
If you tell yourself you'll never get out of bed
Forget the way things could've been
Did I learn anything? It was only that bad with you
September like a dream, but winter got so mean
The storm was underneath, if I could do it all again, I would've said
Chaeri, please, you're killing me
It's only that bad, it's only that bad
If you tell yourself you'll never get out of bed
Chaeri, please, you're killing me
It's only that bad, it's only that bad
If you tell yourself you'll never get out of bed
Three, four, down to the floor
Lose control, little more
Three, four, down to the floor
Lose control, little more
Let it come alive (three, four, down to the floor)
Let it grow (lose control)
Better crucified than unknown (little more)
Let it come alive (three, four, down to the floor)
Let it grow (lose control)
Better cut and dried than unknown (little more)
Let it come alive (three, four, down to the floor)
Let it grow (lose control)
Better crucified than unknown (little more)
Let it come alive, let it grow
Better cut and dried than unknown
