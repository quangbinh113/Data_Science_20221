Song Name: Finally Fine
If I gave you up and never
Ever saw you again, would I be better?
Or would I lose all my spark?
Would the light turn to dark?
Without you would I be myself?
When you leave me, I feel angry
When you come back, I forget what I was saying
Why do you make me that way?
Leave me so quick, won't you stay?
Without you, my problems start weighing
On my shoulders, it gets heavy
I try to carry the load
I need something that will help me
I just can't do it alone
I don't need you like I used to
But I think about you every day
How you could make me forget
What I would never confess
Without you I can't run away
Now that I left you, I'm better than ever
And even though you still cross my mind
I could never go back
To the life that we had
Without you I'm finally fine
And the trees seem so much greener
How could I be so blind?
And the fruit tastes so much sweeter
Without you life is sublime
