Song Name: Japanese Denim
I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that, yeah
But I wait for you
I don't like to drink, I don't like to think, fuck that, ooh
But I ponder you, oh
I'm bending it over
You're my four leaf clover
I'm so in love, so in love
There's no one above up above
Forever's a long time, yes
My blue jeans
Will last me all
My life, ohh yes
So should we
I'm spending all, yeah
This time, ohh
Met you at the shop, sun was gettin' hot, I'm lonely, yeah
I'm in the city on my own
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie
But that's the way it goes
I'm reaching Nirvana
Goodbye sweet Rwanda
High school was never for me, yeah
I say let it be, let it be
Forever's a long time, yeah
My blue jeans
Will last me all
My life, ohh yes
So should we
I'm spending all
This time
You don't even know me
You don't even know me, yes
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the tree

Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahh-ah
