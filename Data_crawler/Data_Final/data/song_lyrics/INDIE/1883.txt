Song Name: Midnight on a Sunny Day
When I'm with you
I feel no pain
If I am wrong
No one cares anyway
Midnight on a sunny day
You know the most I can take
Midnight on a sunny day
You chase the bad vibes away
I don't care who you used to be
It's not fair, that's old news to me
It's alright, I know you've changed
Everyone has bad days
Midnight on a sunny day
You know the most I can take
Midnight on a sunny day
You chase the bad vibes away
Away, away, away, away
Hey, dude, where'd you get your shades?
I lost my pair in Echo Park the other day
Midnight on a sunny day
You know the most I can take
Midnight on a sunny day
You chase the bad vibes away
