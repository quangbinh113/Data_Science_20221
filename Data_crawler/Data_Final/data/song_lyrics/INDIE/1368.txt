Song Name: Summer In My Head
It's a helpless game, you know when seasons change
Sit down but do you remember? Does it feel the same?
It must be so easy living life as you should
If you can fly, yeah, you would out of your neighborhood
Could have been so easy, get in a getaway car
And you know who you are, you're the star of the
Picture on a Saturday night, we're in a middle of true love
Yeah, the tale of your life on the silver screen
Is the summer really that nice? When you think of that night
Well, we were cold as the nights on the telephone
It's a helpless game, every time it rains
Why does the weather brings us together? I know it feels so strange
Even if it feel so easy, I wanna be understood
If I can fly, yeah, I would, out of your neighborhood
Don't wanna feel so easy, you're at the top of town
Then you're the queen of the town, like that she did and
Picture on a Saturday night, we're in a middle of true love
The tale of your life on the silver screen
Is the summer really that nice? When you think of that night
Well, we were cold as the nights on the telephone
Summer's always better in my head
Better in my head, better in my head
Summer's always better in my head
Better in my head, better in my head
Picture on a Saturday night, we're in a middle of true love
With the tale of your life on the silver screen
Is the summer really that nice? When you think of that night
Well, we were cold as the nights on the telephone
