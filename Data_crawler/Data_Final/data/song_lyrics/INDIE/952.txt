Song Name: LMK
Lately, I've been missing you
But I know everything is gonna be alright
Thoughts of me kissing you
That would all lead up to the times we'd fight
Wanna know what's up with you
Ever since you left, you've been out of sight
Girl, I wanna know the truth
Just so I could tell you what's on my mind
What's up? I've been calling you
It seems like I can't get to you
Thought I was being on feeling blue
Feels like I'm alone in this game for two (yeah)
Tell me what you wanna do
Live your life, no stopping you
When you're up late nights, who you talking to?
Let me know, I'm so confused
Oh-oh-oh
What you want?
Let me know and I'll stop
Ooh, so confused over you
Yes it's true, I'm missing you
So tell me how you're feeling
I just want you to know
I can move on if you leave me alone
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
