Song Name: Dance In Room Song
Fuck you
Fuck all your friends
Everyone, all of them
I liked it better when you knew me
When you held my hand
But love is gone (It's gone)
Love is dead (It's dead, It's dead, It's dead, yeah)
It's all fluid
And Simon says
"Play along," I'm playing dead
I can't believe I let you lose me
Now I hold my breath
I get high off, high off
Feeling half alive, well
I don't wanna be a
Freak, I don't (Fuck)
But I remember every single morning
Every joke, you know, and all I'll say is
Everybody's leaving, but you don't know
I make pretend
I turn off all the lights, I
Dance, I scream, I cry
I think i'm ugly, I'm ugly
They never wanna touch me
I'm sick, I don't mind
I like to picture you in movement
In a big black dress
But goodbye, goodbye
Guess you were never mine, so
I don't wanna be a
Freak, I don't
But I remember every single morning
Every joke, you know, and all I'll say is
Everybody's leaving, but you don't know
I make pretend
I turn off all the lights, I
Dance, I scream, I cry
I don't wanna be a
Freak, I don't
But I remember every single morning
Every joke, you know, and all I'll say is
Everybody's leaving, but you don't know
I make pretend
I turn off all the lights, I
Dance, I scream, I cry, I cry
