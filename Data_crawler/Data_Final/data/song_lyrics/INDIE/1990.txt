Song Name: Left Hand Free
Ain't shady baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal, eenie meenie minie mo, and flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle, and, oh
My days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his Colt single-action army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days, he disagrees
Oh, no (Speak easy)
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no
Ain't shady baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal, eenie, meenie, minie, mo
And flower you're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no
