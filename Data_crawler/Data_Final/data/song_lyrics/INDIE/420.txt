Song Name: Talia
Hey, my love
I buried you a month or two ago
I keep thinking that you're standing on my floor
That you're waiting there for me

Hey, my love
You've walked out a hundred times, how was I
Supposed to know this time that you wouldn't call
That you wouldn't come home
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing
I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick
I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough
I swear that I will wake up next to you
When you left
You took my bestest friends away
And in this mess
I think I dug a thousand graves
Talia, I hope you're happy anyway
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing
I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick
I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough
I swear that I will wake up next to you
Broke my heart
Now I'm wasting my time on you
Broke my heart
Now I'm wasting my time
If I drink enough
I can see you dancing
I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick
I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing
I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick
I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough
I swear that I will wake up next to you
