Song Name: Rose Pink Cadillac
Oh, I love the way you dance
Hm, how you move your feet
Hm, how you turn your head
How you look me in the eyes, my girl
You're a rose pink Cadillac
And I love the way you roll
Sink your wild tagged teeth through my neck
Oh, until the blood flows
Life's a longass journey
With some fool that wrote the map
Everyone's digging for the cross on the page
No one knows where it's at
'Cause I love the way you move
Love what you do
Everything you are to me
'Cause I love the way you are
Love what you talk
Evеrything you do is neat
Love to know how, baby
I could get a chance
Just to look in your еyes
Maybe I could be your man
How you do the things you do
I don't understand
How you do that things you do with your heart
I'll never know
You're a rose pink Cadillac
And I love the way you roll
Sink your wild tagged teeth through my neck
Oh, until the blood flows
Life's a longass journey
With some fool that wrote the map
Everyone's digging for the cross on the page
No one knows where it's at
'Cause I love the way you move
Love what you do
Everything you are to me
'Cause I love the way you are
Love what you talk
Everything you do is neat
Love to know how, baby
I could get a chance
Just to look in your eyes
Maybe I could be your man
'Cause I love the way you move (love to know how, baby)
Love what you do
Everything you are to me (I could get a chance)
'Cause I love what just you are (just to look in your eyes maybe)
Love what you talk
Everything you do is neat (I could be your man)
'Cause I love the way you move (love to know how, baby)
Love what you do
Everything you are to me (I could get a chance)
(Just to look in your eyes maybe I could be your man)
