Song Name: In The Waiting Line
Wait in line
'Til your time
Ticking clock
Everyone stop
Is everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Do you believe
In what you see?
There doesn't seem to be anybody else who
Agrees with me
Do you believe
What you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see?
Nine to five
Living lies
Everyday
Stealing time
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Do you believe
What you feel?
It doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me
Do you believe
What you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see?
And I'll shout and I'll scream
But I'd rather not be seen
And I'll hide away
For another day
Do you believe
What you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see?
Is everyone saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Is everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
And everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
And everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
