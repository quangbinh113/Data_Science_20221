Song Name: Phone
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone when you know I need time alone?
What we had was strong
But I'm tryna move on
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop blowing up my phone
You called me yesterday
Say what you always say
That I've been on your brain
You're wishing we could get back (Oh yeah)
Talking that you miss my face (Really?)
But I said we needed space
Who am I to think you've changed?
'Cause every day you've been
Tweeting me, texting me
Anyway you can talk to me
And the truth and reality is
It's so over
You leave another message
But this isn't what an ex is
Just cut the line
I need me myself a night
But you still call my phone
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone when you know I need time alone?
What we had was strong (It was so strong)
But I'm tryna move on (Tryna move on)
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop blowing up my phone
Had to block your number twice
Based on my friend's advice (Block his number)
Told you a gazillion times
To leave me alone to do me (You better do it)
I've got my shit to do (That's right)
No doubt that you do too
Yes, love is hard to lose
But you gotta let go
It's a shame we weren't to be
But I'm doing whats best for me
Thats the truth and reality
When it's so over
You leave another message
But this isn't what an ex is
Just cut the line
I need me myself a night
But you still call my phone
Why'd you call my phone? (Call my phone)
Why'd you call my phone when you know I need
Time alone? (When you know I need time alone)
What we had was strong (It was so strong)
But I'm tryna move on (Tryna move on)
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop blowing up my phone
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone when you know I need time alone?
(When you know I need time)
What we had was strong (So strong)
But I'm tryna move on (Move on)
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop
And so you say it's because "I love you"
I won't lie, every now and then I think of us
Can you stop calling please babe
Give me the space I needed
Maybe I will still be there
But you still call my phone
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone when you
Know I need time alone? (When you know)
What we had was strong (It was so strong)
But I'm tryna move on (Tryna move on)
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop blowing up my phone
Tell me why?
Why'd you call my phone?
Why'd you call my phone when you know I need time alone?
(When you know I need some time alone)
What we had was strong (So string)
But I'm tryna move on (Tryna move on)
I'm not asking for too much
Just please stop blowing up my phone
