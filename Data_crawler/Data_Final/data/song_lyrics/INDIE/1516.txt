Song Name: First Love / Late Spring
The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet
A peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that
Lately, I've been crying like a tall child
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't", so I can crawl back in
And I was so young when I behaved 25
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't," so I can crawl back in
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
