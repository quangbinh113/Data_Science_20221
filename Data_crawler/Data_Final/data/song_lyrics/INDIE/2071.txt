Song Name: The Book Lovers
Lines and lines
Of the spines
Colored everyone
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Down the aisles
Along the titles
Where you and your eyes
Read with your eyes
Aah...
Read the sign above the door
It's not for everyone
Makes you feel
Individual pages are one
But that you ignore
Aah...
Read the sign above the door
You're on like anyone
Down the aisles
Along the titles
Where you and your eyes
Read with your eyes
Aah...
Read the sign above the door
It's not for everyone
