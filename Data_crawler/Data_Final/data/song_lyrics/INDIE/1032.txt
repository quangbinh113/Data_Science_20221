Song Name: You Right
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through that I just wanna get with you
And you're right
You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe, and you'd never feel the same
You'd be thinking 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales, but we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no, she tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me, acting like it's not that deep
Boy, you can take it off of me, tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to be, I can't tell no one but they all know
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through that I just wanna get with you
And you're right
You right (you right), I got my guy (you right)
But I, I (I) can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Girl, I want you like you want me to
I feel that energy (oh, yeah)
When you're on top of me (oh, yeah)
I know your man, he ain't controlling you
But you still hesitate
'Cause you choose loyalty (oh, yeah)
And I know your history (hey)
Met him before your peak (hey)
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes, I'll put it in, then you'll belong to me
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through that I just wanna get with you
And you're right
You right, I (right) got my guy (I got my-)
But I, I, (but I) can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I (yeah) got my guy (yeah)
But I, I (yeah) can't help it, I want you
