Song Name: Backwards Directions
It's true
I gotta dirty mouth do you
Think about the things I do
When it's judgement hour and I never knew
It's true
I gotta dirty mouth do you
Think about the things I do
When it's judgement hour and I never knew
I've been running backwards directions
Hold my hand accept my confession
I've been spinning in and out again
I've been running backwards directions
Hold my hand accept my confession
I've been spinning in and out again
Let me pull my hair back
And put me on a better track
My lungs are full a little burnt
But yours I know are much worse
Let me get my story straight
I'll find you in another place
The game is rigged I want my prize
I guess I'll just take first place
I've been running backwards directions
Hold my hand accept my confession
I've been spinning in and out again
I've been running backwards directions
Hold my hand accept my confession
I've been spinning in and out again
It's true
I got a dirty mouth like you
Think about the things I do
When it's judgement hour and I never knew
I've been running backwards directions (it's true)
Hold my hand accept my confession (I got a dirty mouth do you)
I've been spinning in and out again (Do you)
I've been running backwards directions (it's true)
Hold my hand accept my confession (got a dirty mouth do you)
I've been spinning in and out again (Do you)
