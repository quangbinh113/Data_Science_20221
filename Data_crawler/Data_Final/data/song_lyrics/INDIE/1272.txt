Song Name: Evergreen (You Didnâ€™t Deserve Me At All)
He don't love me no more
He don't love me no more (ooh, ooh-ooh)
Evergreen, he controls me
Was there something wrong with my body?
Am I not what you wanted, babe?
If I ever tried, If I ever tried, I would
Evergreen (oh, oh)
He tears me to pieces (oh, oh)
(Evergreen, oh, oh)
Doesn't even have to try (evergreen, oh, oh)
She don't know you like me
She could never love you more, more than me
But sometimes, I pray that you fall in love (I, I)
I've cried, I've cried so much for you, baby
Evergreen (oh, oh)
He tears me to pieces (oh, oh)
(Evergreen, oh, oh)
Doesn't even have to try (evergreen, oh, oh)
You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I'd break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all, at all, at all
One last time, I see Ever, Evergreen
Please, don't come home to me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, sweet Evergreen
He don't love me no more
He don't love me no more
He don't love me no more
