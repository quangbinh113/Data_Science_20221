Song Name: Call Me Your Hope
Call me your hope
I will meet you tonight if you did it right
Somethin' you say
You won't feel
Anything that would come across your own mind
Hey
Look at the time
It's noon soon
You won't be able to see me
I'll disappear
If I found out
That you're not worth
My precious time
Call me your hope
I will meet you tonight if you did it right
Somethin' you say
You won't feel
Anything that would come across your own mind
I will meet you tonight if you did it right
Somethin' you say
You won't feel
Anything that would come across your own mind
