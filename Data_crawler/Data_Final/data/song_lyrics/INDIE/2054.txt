Song Name: Say Goodbye
I do so much shit for you
But yet all you do is call out my wrongs
I am always there for you
But yet all you do is call out when I'm gone
Just make up your mind
I don't wanna waste my time
Stop saying that you love me when you don't even try
I've been up since the AM
Bottling up my emotions 'cause
When I say, "What's wrong?" that's another fucking wrong
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yea
You had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yea
You had all this time
(Go ahead and cry, yea, you had all this time)
(You had all this time)
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, god damn
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, god damn
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yea
You had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
What's the point of trying now
When you had all this time?
What's the point in trying now
When you had all this time?
