Song Name: The Adults Are Talking
They've been saying
"You're sophisticated"
They're complaining, overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your walls
And don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused, 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you
You were waitin' for the elevator
You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming
No more askin', questions, or excuses
Information's here

Here and everywhere
And don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused, 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and then
I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not
It's not your fault
I don't want anyone
As I do
It's not for you
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ooh-ooh
Stockholders

Same shit, a different life
I'll get it right sometime
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
(Yeah boy, here we go)
(And a one, and a two, and a three)
(Here we go friends)
(Come on, I can't)
(Maybe that's a kooky situation)
(So let's go back to the old key, old tempo, everything)
