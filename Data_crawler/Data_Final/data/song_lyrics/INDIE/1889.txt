Song Name: Baby
Sometimes I know how to dance with you
Sometimes but not today
In love, are you?
In love with you
You know that baby I'll be in your eyes
I see you know that baby I'll be in your eyes
You know that baby I'll be in your eyes
I see you know that baby I'll be in your eyes
Sometimes, you know, everybody sways
Sometimes but not today
In love, are you?
In love with you
I don't know what to do with you
So tell me what to do with you
You know that baby I'll be in your eyes
I see you know that baby I'll be in your eyes
You know that baby I'll be in your eyes
I see you know that baby I'll be in your eyes
I don't know what to do with you
So tell me what to do with you
I don't know what to do with you
So tell me what to do with you
