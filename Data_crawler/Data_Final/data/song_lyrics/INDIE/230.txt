Song Name: Hot Rod
My memory is not like the other one
Turn to strike my face
Always second place
Tell me again why is it I
Never can do anything right?
Complicated theories of life, sarcastically
But we both know-oh-oh
The way it's gonna go-oh-oh in the same way
Maybe I'm not all not that you thought
And we don't mo-o-ove
Like we used to do-o-o in the same way
Maybe you're not such a hot rod
Taken back again all the I ever was
It was only just a phase
I never thought of it that way
But what do I know?
I'm sorry for
Not wanting to be your d√©cor
Truth is such a violent force, pushing you away
But we both know-oh-oh
The way it's gonna go-oh-oh, in the same way
Maybe I'm not all that you thought
And we don't mo-o-ove
Like we used to do-o-o in the same way
Maybe you're not such a hot rod
Oh we both know-oh-oh
The way it's gonna go-oh-oh, in the same way
Maybe I'm not all that you thought
And we don't mo-o-ove
Like we used to do-o-o in the same way
Maybe you're not such a hot rod
