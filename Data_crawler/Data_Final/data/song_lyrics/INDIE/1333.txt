Song Name: MANIC PIXIE DREAM BOY
1, 2, 3, go!
Hard to remember
Just how it came about
Waited forever
To find you like to play around
You said you loved me
You've never said before
Only to vanish
Right outside my front door
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
You dare daredevil
Tattoos right up your neck
Crying to death grips
So unapologetic
Oh, how I miss you
In all your toxic ways
Guess you were never
Gonna be my baby
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
He want the noise
He want the noise
My manic pixie dream boy
