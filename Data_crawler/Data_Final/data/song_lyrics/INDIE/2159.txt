Song Name: London Is Lonely
Started feeling like I'm living in the upside-down
Haven't seen you in forever and I don't know how?
And I've been smoking and staying out too late
But you know I've got good intentions, babe
Started feeling like I could see you in the rush hour crowd
When I catch you in a stranger on the underground
But something's missing, I've got an empty space
And something's different when you leave my place
So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll not try to think of the distances between us
And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'll be alright
But it's getting harder and harder to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay? 'Cause I'm, oh, so sick of this place
Feeling way too big and nothing can hold me
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely without you
Any minute now I swear, I'm gonna lose my mind
So many people, it's so easy to get lost sometimes
And this winter is going on too long
Though it don't snow here, it's stays pretty cold
And I miss your warmth
So I'll try not say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us
And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'll be alright
But it's getting harder and harder to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay? 'Cause I'm, oh, so sick of this place
Feeling way too big
And nothing can hold me
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely
I'm lonely without you
I'm lonely without you
God, I'm lonely without you
And it's so good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'll be alright
But it's getting harder and harder to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay? 'Cause I'm, oh, so sick of this place
Feeling way too big
And nothing can hold me
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely
I'm lonely without you (I'm lonely without you)
I'm lonely without you (so lonely without you)
God, I'm lonely without you (so lonely without you)
London is lonely, so lonely
I'm lonely without you
God, I'm lonely without you
Without you, mmm
