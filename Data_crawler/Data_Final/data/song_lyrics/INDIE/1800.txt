Song Name: Ruin My Life
I think I'm gonna crash my car
'Cause I can't keep my eyes on anything but you
Run away with no regard for the rest of the world
'Cause the rest of the world isn't you
Everything at once wouldn't be too soon
Putting all my eggs in one basket
It's so dramatic and probably problematic
I wanna fuck off every one of my plans
Fall out with every one of my friends
Burn all of my bridges
I'd kill my career long as you're right here
Wanna sneak out of every party
Stop trying to be somebody
Would you come be my downfall?
One look at you, and I'd lose it all
I wouldn't mind
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life (Ruin my life, ruin my life)
I think I'm gonna break my phone
And lеt everyone еlse I know forget me
You're the only one who gets me
Like when we jumped into the ocean
It was so cold, I was holding my breath
Under shades of blue
Right there that was the moment I knew
I would fuck off every one of my plans
Fall out with every one of my friends
Burn all of my bridges
I'd kill my career long as you're right here
Wanna sneak out of every party
Stop trying to be somebody
Would you come be my downfall?
One look at you, and I'd lose it all
I wouldn't mind
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life (Ruin my life, ruin my life)
I wouldn't mind
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life (Ruin my life, ruin my life)
Baby, I know if I died tomorrow
You'd be the last thing I think about when I go out
I wanna fuck off every one of my plans
Fall out with every one of my friends
Burn all of my bridges
I'd kill my career long as you're right here
Wanna sneak out of every party
Stop trying to be somebody
Would you come be my downfall?
One look at you, and I'd lose it all
I wouldn't mind
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life (Ruin my life, ruin my life)
I wouldn't mind
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life
Wouldn't mind if you ruin my life (Ruin my life, ruin my life)
