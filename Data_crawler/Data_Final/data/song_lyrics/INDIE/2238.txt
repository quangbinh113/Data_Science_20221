Song Name: what if love isn't enough
Running a race without a finish sign
And I'm losing again, like every other time
Behind my first intentions, a shadow of doubt
You're sharp and you know it, and I'm bleeding out
And one thing I know for sure
Is that nothing is sacred anymore
You're leavin' again like you always do
But don't tell me you missed me, 'cause you didn't have to
And all that I know for sure
Is that nothing is sacred anymore
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
What if love isn't enough, isn't enough?
