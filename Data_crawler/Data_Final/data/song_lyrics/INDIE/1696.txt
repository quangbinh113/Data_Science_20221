Song Name: I'm in Love
I'm in love
With someone
Whose in love
With someone
And that someone will never be me
It's a real damn shame
Yet I'm the one
Who caught you dancing in the rain
And then fell in love
I shoulda kept my guard up, yeah I know
But it's like the rain was falling lighter
Then the snow
Or just like in movie scenes, where everything
Became so slow
And I don't know why I can never forget
The moment I saw her
Right on my door step
Her heart is a heart like no other
I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that someone will never be me
And I'll take a look
Look at you
Look at them
And you seem so happy
Something I know that I'll never be
You know I can't help but wish that you were mine
I bet you must be tired from always running through my mind
I try not to but it hurts me when you won't spare me a glance
God what I would do for a chance to be your...
Man I must be dumb
Caught between someone and someone that they love
Should've left that fantasy behind and been done
I try to convince myself that you ain't the one
Now I'm in love
I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that someone will never be me
And I'll take a look
Look at you
Look at him
And you seem so happy
Something I know that I'll never be
Da da da da da
I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that someone will never be me
I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that someone will never be me
