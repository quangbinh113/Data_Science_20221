Song Name: When I R.I.P.
Cheer
They been waiting for me
What the fuck? The fuck?
Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take
Just alive tryin'
'Cause it's been a long day
'Cause I'm asleep when I R.I.P (ba-da-da-dam)
Flashbacks
Relapse
Camera flash
And don't forget your hashtag
Rucksack
White stacks
You're a dead man
You better rid of that gat
You gonna run game
They don't never run you, uh
When they bitchin' on your name
You say fuck you too, too
It's a fuckin' cold case
Give detective no clues, clues
'Cause I'm Indiana J
When I'm trippin' on the juice
Now let's get real quiet
Feel so, feel so stupid, woo!
Ye-yeah, talk to me
'Bout to make a big deal, uproar
And I'm in for the kill, La Roux
Bitches lookin' like a meal, contour
Percocet until we can't feel no more
And I smoked somethin' that gon' knock me out, out
Somehow this body won't just stay down, down
Now let's get real quiet
Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take (ba-da-ba-dam)
Just alive tryin' 'cause it's been a long day (ba-da-ba-dam)
'Cause I'm asleep when I R.I.P (ba-da-ba-dam)
