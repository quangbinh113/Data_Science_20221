Song Name: Dover Beach
On the coastline, in the water
Your mirage is like a stalker
I should push him off the cliff side
'Cause he's colouring my insides ocean blue
And everywhere I look, I look at you
It's true
Up in my imagination, I rehearse our conversations
And at least I'm never lonely
Even though I know you're only in my mind
And there's no point in covering my eyes, even when I try
I hear your voice over and over
Sitting on the bеach of Dover
What is happening? Oh dear
I keep wishing you wеre here
And I swear I'm gonna lose it if I keep playing your music
But what else is there to do?
Everywhere I look I just see you
In my self-made isolation, you're my only inspiration
When the mirror says I'm ugly and if anybody loves me, it's a lie
And right before I'm swallowed by my mind and cursing at the sky
I hear your voice over and over
Sitting on the beach of Dover
What is happening? Oh dear
I keep wishing you were here
And I swear, I'm gonna lose it if I keep playing your music
But what else is there to do?
Everywhere I look, I just see you
It's deep red, my broken dream
My last breath, the king and queen
The world ends, it's you and me
In my head, if we can be together maybe we'll live forever
Sand between my toes, I've got vertigo, I'm afraid of heights
If I could I'd cry, we've got incompatible star signs
I'm in love with you
What's the point in looking at the view?
'Cause every time I do, I just see you (I just see you)
It's deep red, my broken dream
My last breath, the king and queen
The world ends, it's you and me
In my head if we can be together, maybe we'll live forever
I met your ghost, he followed me
Down to the coast of Dover Beach
I talk to you in poetry
You stole the view of Dover Beach
I met your ghost, he followed me
Down to the coast of Dover Beach
I scream at you in poetry
You stole the view of Dover Beach
