Song Name: i feel like chet
It's really bad
I fall too hard
One simple chat
I've got no guard
I feel like Chet
It's way too easy
Falling in love
Oh, isn't that cheesy
Oh, isn't that cheesy
I sit around all day
Just listening to love songs
Thinking about how someday
My someone will come along
I'm a hopeless romantic
Afraid of commitment
But I can't help that I like to think
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat (my glasses are tinted rose pink)
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I live on dreams
Above the clouds
Creating crushes
Out of crowds
Molding stories
Out of clay
And knowing that
It's all for play
It's all for play
I'd like to believe that
Something could happen with me
But I don't talk and I don't chat
I just lay awake hoping I'll find the key
I'm a hopeless romantic
Afraid of commitment
But I can't help that I like to think
Though my glasses are tinted rose pink
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat (my glasses are tinted rose pink)
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
I feel like Chet
But I won't chat
No not with you
'Cause it'd fall flat
