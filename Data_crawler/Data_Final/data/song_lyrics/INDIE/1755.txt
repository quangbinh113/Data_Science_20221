Song Name: Synchronize
Smoke in the sky got me feeling so blue
Burning down the city while I'm here with you
Smoke in the sky and I'm holding you tight
Because
I love the way we synchronize
We synchronize
Let the moment crystallize
Don't think twice
I just wanna simmer
Like the way you glimmer
Pretty fires all around
Tell me, are we dreaming?
Dancing on the ceiling
Wanna keep you safe and sound
And all the smoke in the sky got me feeling so blue
Burning down the city while I'm here with you
Smoke in the sky and I'm holding you tight
Because
I love the way we synchronize
We synchronize
Let the moment crystallize
Don't think twice (yeah)
Feel your skin on mine
Forget about the time
Floating on a purple cloud
I don't mind as long as you hold me in your arms
We ain't never coming down
And all the smoke in the sky got me feeling so blue
Burning down the city while I'm here with you
Smoke in the sky, and I'm holding you tight (yeah)
'Cause I love the way we synchronize
I love the way we synchronize (we synchronize)
Let the moment crystallize (crystallize)
I love the way we synchronize (don't think twice)
I love the way we synchronize (I love the way we synchronize)
We synchronize (let the moment crystallize)
Crystallize (I love the way we synchronize)
Don't think twice (don't think twice)
(I love the way)
(I love the way we synchronize)
(I love the way)
(I love the way we synchronize)
(Don't think twice)
