Song Name: Keep You Mine
Guess we started a fire
Now the bedroom is burning
Can we put it out?
'Cause we're both saying things
That we're gonna regret when
Every word's too loud
We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Gotta lay low, low, low now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better
When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're falling
It hurts less in the morning
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
To keep me yours and keep you mine
There's a cloud in this room
And I can't cut the tension
'Cause we lost the knife
In the mountain of dishes
That none of us mention
We eat out at night
We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Gotta lay low, low, low now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better
When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're falling
It hurts less in the morning
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
