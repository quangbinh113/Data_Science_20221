Song Name: Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
I think she got what she wanted
Waited a week before she even responded
We had a couple friends in common when I met her
Wasn't worried, but I should've been
I think she knew what she was doing getting into my car
Outside Amoeba Music or the standard bar
Independent when I met her
Now she's my only medicine
When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's staring at the ceiling like she's seeing outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be Heaven if Heaven was an actual place

(For the record)
This is not what I wanted
I wanted my heart to remain in my pocket
She took it out and wrote her name right on it
And now I'm only borrowing
How come every time I leave,I can't breathe as deep?
I'm always staying on the call while she falls asleep
Might call it codependency, look at me
Freezing while she's showering
When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's staring at the ceiling like she's seeing outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be Heaven if Heaven was an actual place
When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's staring at the ceiling like she's seeing outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be Heaven if Heaven was an actual place
