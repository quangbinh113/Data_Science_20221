Song Name: Anti-glory
(Tur-)
Slipping away our car
Up and downtown
Now feeling up is falling me out
In the back of the barn, in the back of the yard
From the town in the back where it's far
(Tur-)
Turn it away, can't make it out out loud
Now feeling the filth of the town
From the dance in the hall
To the plans guitar
For the boy in his band, they don't know one at all
(Tur-)
In gray it's always upper down left
Like Conan for the never uptight
Dance

Dance
With me
(Tur-)
Slipping away our car
Up and downtown
Now feeling up is falling me out
In the back of the barn, in the back of the yard
From the town in the back where it's far
(Tur-)
Turn it away, can't make it out out loud
Now feeling for a filth of the town
From the dance in the hall
To the plan's guitar
For the boy in his band, they don't know one at all
(Tur-)
In gray it's always upper down left
Like Conan for the never uptight
