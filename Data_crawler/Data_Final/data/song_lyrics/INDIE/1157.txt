Song Name: drunk
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
Smell like smoke, nuit de l'homme
It's been a while since we last spoke
So tell me, how's it go?
Still love blues, nothin' new
Careless love, I've had a few
How 'bout you?
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
I never have thought
When you're gone
I'd find it hard to carry on
And it's probably 'cause
I fell in love way back then
And I think about us when
I think about us when
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
I got nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
I got, I got nobody else
