Song Name: Warning Sign - Alt Version
All the words you know
Tell a lie even if wrong
As the worst things unfold
Tell the truth just to be told

It's a warning sign
I'm just reading it bad
There's a broken line
All the ways we've had
All the words you hold

Feel the wind turn into cold
Building up what you've done
All the times we still had those

I can't understand
But still I call you when I'm down
Left under the plan
Anymore to where I find
You came around
I can't understand
But still I call you when I'm down
Left under the plan
Anymore to where I find
You came around
I can't understand
But still I call you when i'm down
Left under the plan
Anymore to where I find
You came around
