Song Name: Care
When I mess up, I can't help but smile
Why don't you stay for a while?
I got a few things to say
But you don't care anyway (you just don't care)
I must be talking to a wall (a wall)
'Cause girl, your face (your face)
Says it all
You just don't care
I wish you cared (I wish you cared)
Why don't you care
With me tonight?
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, tonight (tonight)
Tonight, tonight (tonight)
(Tonight)
(Tonight)
When?
