Song Name: Lovers Rock
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm trying to tell you something
Something that I already said
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who is trying to sell you something
Something that you already have
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of this song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing
While the others talk
We were listening to lovers rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom

And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of this song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing
