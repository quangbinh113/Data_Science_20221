Song Name: Wait, I Lied
I kept us moving at the beat of my heart
Your voice was soothing, how did we fall apart?
Wish it was better, how did it all fade away?
Another letter, begging you to stay
I've seen you here, stop and stare
I don't care
Believe me dear, you're everywhere
I can't get you off my head
Wait, I lied, do you wanna know the truth?
It's all coming back to you
What the hell am I to do?
What the hell am I to do?
You kept on trying to justify the wrong
I kept on crying, where do I belong?
I've seen you here, stop and stare
I don't care
Believe me dear, you're everywhere
I can't get you off my head
Wait, I lied, do you wanna know the truth?
It's all coming back to you
What the hell am I to do?
What the hell am I to do?
I seen you here, you stop and stare
You're everywhere
Believe me dear, I don't care
I can't get you off my mind
Wait, I lied (not again), do you wanna know the truth? (Yeah)
Is it coming back to you? (I still need you)
What the hell am I to do? (I still want your love)
What the hell am I to do?
