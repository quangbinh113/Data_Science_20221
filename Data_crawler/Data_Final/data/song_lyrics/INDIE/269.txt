Song Name: Make Me Your Queen
I know that I mean nothing to you, babe
I've tried my best to keep these thoughts away
Oh, I've tried to speak but there's nothing left to say
'Cause I mean nothing to you, babe
I know that I mean nothing to you, dear
If ever I stop by, you're never here
And I don't mean shit, I know you've made that clear
'Cause I mean nothing to you, dear
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
Ahh
I know that I mean nothing to you, babe
I'm in your grip from which I can't escape
And I can't help but think that I might maybe not mean nothing to you, babe
Oh babe
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
Oh, so too much to take
I'm awake, I'm awake
I feel false and I feel fake
And I'm awake, I'm awake
It ain't hard to get sick of my shit
I'm asymmetrical
Get over it for goodness sake
I'm awake, I'm awake
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
It's all too much to take
I'm awake, I'm awake
