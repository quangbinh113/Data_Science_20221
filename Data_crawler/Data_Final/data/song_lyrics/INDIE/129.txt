Song Name: 888
Walking in Figures of 8
I hope I'm not too late
Figure 8 clouds
I'm working things out
Clouds looking strange
Papercut fingers dancing on the strings
If I could see you right now
I'd dance just for you when the nightlight goes out
Would you dance for me too?
I'm counting on you
The corner shop closes in under an hour
Let's buy too much booze and get drunk in the shower
Thinking in figures of 8 and it's easy 'cause
I know what it adds up to
Every day is the same but you gave me a brand new set of numbers
Life's in a different colour
Would you dance for me too?
We'll make Peppa Pig plasters the coolest new trend
I never asked for my childhood to end
I'm trapped in my tiny human brain and it's killing me
But I'm fine, yeah, I'm alright
If I move my hands fast enough, I won't die
I'm trapped in my tiny human brain and it's killing me
But I'm fine, yeah, I'm alright
If I move my hands fast enough, I won't die
If I move my hands fast enough, I won't die
