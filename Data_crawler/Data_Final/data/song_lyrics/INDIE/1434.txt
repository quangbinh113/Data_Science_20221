Song Name: Silk Chiffon
Sundown and I'm feeling lifted
Downtown cherry lipstick
Watch her silk dress dancing in the wind
Watch it brush against her skin
Makes me wanna try her on
Like life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my miniskirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side cause I'm out til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
I'm high and I'm feeling anxious
Inside of the CVS
Watch her turn round halfway down the aisle
With that you're on camera smile
Like she wants to try me on
And life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my miniskirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side cause I'm out til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She say that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
If it feels good to me, it feels good to me
Ooh, why wouldn't it be? ooh, why wouldn't it be?
If it feels good to me, it feels good to me
Ooh, why wouldn't it be? ooh, why wouldn't it be?
She's so soft like silk chiffon
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
Silk
Chiffon
That's how it feels
Ooh, when she's on me
