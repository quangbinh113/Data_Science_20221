Song Name: I'm with You
I saw you standing there
Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle, my darling, I'm ready
To burst into flames for you
I was just coasting 'til we met
You remind me just how good it can get
Well, I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't, it feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start and when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around 1:00
We fell asleep to escape from the sun, and we woke up
To the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said, "Baby, this rain changes everything"
And my heart ran away from me
I was just coasting 'til we met
You remind me just how good it can get
Well, I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't, it feels like you do
Opening up can open some wounds
How does it start and when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
Darling, I do
I'm with you
There's nothing I won't do
To see you shine
I'll swing for the fences, I'll run to the line
And it's high time that you love me
'Cause you do it so well
To see you shine
I'll swing for the fences, I'll run to the line
And it's high, high time
Oh darling, I'm with you
Oh darling, I'm with you
There's nothing I won't do
There's nothing I won't do, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm with you
Oh, darling, I'm with you
