Song Name: Where Is My Mind?
Whooo-ooh
Stop
Whoo-oooh
Whoo-oooh
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground (whoo-oooh)

Try this trick and spin it, (yeah) yeah (whoo-oooh)
Your head will collapse (whoo-oooh)
If there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean (whoo-oooh)

Animals were hidin' behind the rock (whoo-oooh)
Except for little fish (whoo-oooh)
Bumped into me, swear he was trying to talk to me coy koi
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground (whoo-oooh)

Try this trick and spin it, yeah (whoo-oooh)
Your head will collapse (whoo-oooh)
If there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
Way out in the water, I see it swimmin'
(Whoo-oooh)
Yeah, our feet on the air and our heads on the ground (whoo-oooh)
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (whoo-oooh)
(Whoo-oooh)
(Whoo-oooh)

(Whoo-oooh)
(Whoo-oooh)
Whoo-oooh
