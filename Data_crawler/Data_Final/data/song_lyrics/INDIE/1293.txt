Song Name: Deep End
Throw me in the deep end
I'm ready now to swim
The air in my lungs
May not last very long but I'm in
I see you on the weekend
Dancing like a star
You've practiced your lines
To convince us you're fine
But I know that's not where you are
Once in a blue moon
You may come undone
We're made up of the same blood
I'll be your medicine if you let me
Give you reason to get out of bed
Sister I'm trying to hold off the lightning
And help you escape from your head
Come and waste the day
Watch a super 8 video tape
We were kids in the car
Having lighthearted arguments
We don't know what's there 'til it's gone
Just hear me out
And you might understand
We're made up of the same blood
I'll be your medicine if you let me
Give you reason to get out of bed
Sister I'm trying to hold off the lightning
And help you escape from your head
Throw me in the deep end
I'm ready now to swim
