Song Name: Float
Understated, overwhelming
Life is always best when you're around
You make everything I once thought great seem so insignificant now
Everything I wanna tell you
I don't think I have the words right now
But everything that makes me feel alive
I swear you make me feel, somehow
I stumble over words I haven't said in years
It's so different with you
Forever I'll beg this feeling to stay
Dear, I hope that you do too
'Cause when I lay awake at night
The thought of you brings peace of mind
And I can't lie, despite my trials
I've lacked this peace for all my life
For all my life, mmm
Honey, it's okay, you're afraid of falling
You don't have to say it out loud
But you know, you
Take another step off the edge, we're floating
We don't have to ever look down
But you know, you
Feels good, it's a heavy copacetic
God knows that I'm never gonna let it go
'Cause baby, I'm not blind
A love like this is hard to find
Feels good, it's a heavy copacetic
God knows that I'm never gonna let it slip
'Cause baby I'm not blind
A love like this, a love like...
Honey, it's okay, you're afraid of falling
You don't have to say it out loud
But you know, you
Take another step off the edge, we're floating
We don't have to ever look down
But you know, you
