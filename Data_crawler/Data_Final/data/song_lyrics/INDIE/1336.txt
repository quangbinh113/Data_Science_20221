Song Name: Uppercut
Nothing better than 1 to 4
Nothing better than saying I love you
To someone you just adore, ah
Nothing better than an accident
Turning into brilliance, and you make some masterwork
And you get some resilience
For when the next time comes
And it's not so yum
And every dark corner of your mind creeps up
Nothing better than a late night Fred's
With Mads, Sarah, Brian & Ren
French fry and laugh riot
Man these guys just totally fuckin shred
Nothing like the dog in the morning
His fat face on my shoulder
I always dreamed of this moment, always
But when the next time comes
And it always does
Where every single moment couldn't get more fucked
Swear it to me babe we'll always have our fun
Even when we're grinded into cosmic dust
Plenty of horror stories
Plenty of bad days
Plenty of haters wanna take your light from you babe
Plenty of pigs, plenty of plagues
Nothing worse than New Year's Eve
I just wanted to feel seen
And I think he knew that when he took what he took from me
But I passed that test
Like I was an elven queen!
And when the record starts
I get real tough
It's a jab, cross, hook, hook Uppercut
I swear it to you babe we'll always have our fun
Even when we're grinded into cosmic dust
And even when we're back on earth as pond scum
I swear to you babe, we'll always have our fun
Plenty of horror stories
Plenty of bad days
Plenty of haters wanna take your light from you babe
Plenty of pigs, plenty of plagues
