Song Name: Hard to Let Go
Hard to let go
My friend, you changed a while ago
Estranged, pride stiffens like dough
You're closing in your cage
Proud sparrow
Hard to let go
I know the slows that break you low
You chase small embers that glow
Hunching close by night
Sleep deprived
Hard to let go
The little voice that "told you so"
Good fiend, I'll never let go
To watch you wash the rain
With water
