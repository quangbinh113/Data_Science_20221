Song Name: Sad B*tch
Sunny with a chance of clinical depression
Henny in the Yeti I'ma drink it like water
Flannel round my ass I don't want no attention
Bitches gettin petty cuz they mans hot and bothered
Leave me the fuck alone lil stupid ass hoe
No more serotonin in my dome
Boutta run thru the bag
Gotta stack in my hand
Show it off on the gram but
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
Lotta bad habits
Think I need another
I'ma pop that seal so I don't gotta feel
Got a smile on my face but the smile ain't real
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
Lotta bad habits
Think I need another
I'ma pop that seal so I don't gotta feel
Got a smile on my face but the smile ain't real
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
Syrup got my tongue turning violet
I'm so numb need some excitement
Confront a bitch now a bitch silent
Attitude got me feelin violent
I ain't with that LA life
Get the money then goodbye
If you want the smoke catch me outside
How you kill a hoe who dead inside
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
Lotta bad habits think I need another
I'ma pop that seal so I don't gotta feel
Got a smile on my face but the smile ain't real
Really I'm a sad bitch
I'm a bummer
