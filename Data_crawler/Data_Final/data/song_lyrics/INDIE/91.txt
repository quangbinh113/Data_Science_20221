Song Name: City Boy
When I walk around my room
There is nothing else to say
When I walk around my room
Everything will be okay, ow!

I am a city boy
You are a city girl
You date the city tool
I am a city fool
I am a city boy
City boy
When you have an artistic view
It'll rub off on your take
When you answer to a bunch of dudes
You should run away
I am a city boy
You are a city girl
You date the city tool
I am a city fool
I am a city fool
I am a city fool
I am a, I am a city fool
I am a, I am a city, city fool
