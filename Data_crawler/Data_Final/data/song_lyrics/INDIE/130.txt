Song Name: Poison
Ease your breath, Untie my hands
Release my neck, If you can
You don't have to be like that
Don't be afraid, There's nothing strange
It's not a trap
But there's cars coming closer
And I think they're trying to run me over
Poisoning my food
And putting drugs inside my water
There's ghosts in my house
And I can taste blood in my mouth
Don't be afraid, I'm not insane
Just irrational, but isn't that the same?
