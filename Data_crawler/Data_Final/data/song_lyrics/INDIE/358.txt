Song Name: Normal
Think I drank too much, again
Looks like fun, but it's pretend
Why do I try to fit in
When I just wanna go home?
And I know this isn't like me
I just want people to like me
Got my glass up in the air
And I act like I don't care
And I take some, but I shouldn't
And I say things that I wouldn't
And I'm just part of the crowd
But I feel better now, so
Keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
Keep on kissing that guy that's not my type
I just wanna feel normal for the night
I should go, it's getting late
But I'ma keep on dancing 'til I feel okay
So keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
Taking pictures in the dark
Smoke it up 'til I can't talk
Fooled myself, almost forgot
That I just wanna go home (I just wanna go home)
And I know this isn't like me
I just want people to like me
Got my glass up in the air
And I act like I don't care
And I take some, but I shouldn't
And I say things that I wouldn't
And I'm just part of the crowd
But I feel better now so
Keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
Keep on kissing that guy that's not my type
I just wanna feel normal for the night
I should go, it's getting late
But I'ma keep on dancing 'til I feel okay
So keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
I, I, I just wanna feel normal for the night
I, I, I just wanna feel normal
So keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
Keep on kissing that guy that's not my type
I just wanna feel normal for the night
I should go, it's getting late
But I'ma keep on dancing 'til I feel okay
So keep on playing that song that I don't like
I just wanna feel normal for the night
