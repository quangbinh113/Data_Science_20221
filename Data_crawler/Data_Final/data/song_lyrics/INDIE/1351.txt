Song Name: N o o N
I got a way to spend some time
You know that I've always been dreaming of your love
Every night just Dreaming of your love
Oh I cannot think
If something I say makes you take a step back awaaay yeah
Ohhh ooo ooo oo ooooh
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
Can you wait a second
You always got me
Waiting for your love
Got me you waiting
Oh girl
I need your attention
Sometimes
Oh oooh
Staying up late
Staying up late
Staying up all night
Waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I didn't know how to spend my days
When you were over there
When you were over there
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
What can I do for now
The way you go through a door got me wanting u
Like I'm a fiend
