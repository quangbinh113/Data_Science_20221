Song Name: Mother
I don't wanna make a big scene
I just need a moment, lying on this street
If your lungs stop, you die
If you lose love, that's life
What a blue sky
All my friends, they miss you a lot
I know your father probably hates my guts
When the lover cuts ties
And the people get caught in the cross-fire
And yesterday I told my mother
You learn to love again
And oh, she was the daughter you never had
And I know sometimes you might miss her
But I know the years can heal
And if there is another
Maybe you'll love them in the same way you loved her
Tuesday with your wet hair and curls
Wearing pajamas and the outside world
Couldn't look in your eyes
Then you got in your car, and started to drive
And yesterday I told my mother
You learn to love again
And oh, she was the daughter you never had
And I know sometimes you might miss her
But I know the years can heal
And if there is another
Maybe you'll love them in the same way you loved her
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
And tomorrow I'll say mother
You learn to love again
I know you want to write her
You never thought you'd grow a blood bond to another
You didn't birth, but that's the joy of human nature
Some people stumble into your heart for all time
