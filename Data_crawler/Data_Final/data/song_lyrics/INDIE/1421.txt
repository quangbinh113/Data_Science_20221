Song Name: Back3School
I post what I did going back to school
I got a new friend and they think I'm cool
I got baby face, gonna make them drool
I'm going back to school
And I got a little sun on my vacation
I'm not in a rush, I got patience
I don't know what it does, but I'm taking some
I'm going back to school
'Cause I don't know who you are, but I'm screaming your name
You suck on my arm and I kiss on your face
Climbed into your car and you drove us away
'Cause I'm going back to school
This song really slapped, brought me back to life
I thought of my kids, I thought of my wife
I thought sometimes I really, really love my life
I'm going back to school
'Cause I don't know who you are, but you're screaming my name
I sucked on your arm and you kissed on my face
Get out of the car, think we went the wrong way
'Cause I'm going back to school
Oh, please take me back to school
