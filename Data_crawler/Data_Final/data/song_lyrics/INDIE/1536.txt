Song Name: I Forget Where We Were
Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria, blinded by the sunshine strips
You, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth the wounded with the wounder's whip
And that's how summer passed
Oh the Great Dividing Range of
Green, green grass and oh
Maybe it was peace at last, who knew
Mm, hello love, my invincible friend
Oh hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were
Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us, the blind leading out the bored
And as per usual, you were
Skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door
Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see
Maybe you're right babe, maybe
And that's how summer passed
Oh the Great Dividing Range of
Green, green grass and oh
Maybe I'll hold on fast to you
Mm, hello love, my invincible friend
Oh hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh hello love, for you, I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no
And that's how summer passed
Oh the Great Dividing Range of
Green, green grass and oh
Maybe it was peace at last, who knew
