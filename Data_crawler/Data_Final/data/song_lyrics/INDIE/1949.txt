Song Name: Marlboro Nights
Two, three, four
I don't wanna go to school tomorrow
I can't study thinking about you
And you know I always do
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
When I can stay up thinking about you
And you know I always do
Marlboro nights
You said you would, you said you would
You said you would, you said you would
Marlboro nights
You said you would, you said you would
You said you would, you said you would (woo)
