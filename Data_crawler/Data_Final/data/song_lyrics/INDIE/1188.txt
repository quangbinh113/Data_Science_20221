Song Name: dear insecurity (feat. ben abraham)
Dear insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am?
Oh, insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be just the way I am?
Dear insecurity
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the things you make me think
You make me sick to my stomach, I wish that I wasn't me
Somedays when I wake up, I see myself in the mirror
I feel like what shouldn't be couldn't be clearer
My nose, to my clothes, from my chin, to my skin
I'll never be good enough, ever again
For you, so I'd change for you
Then I dyed for you, then you made me blue
If I were you, I'd hate me too
But I already feel like you do
Because you tell me I'm not worth shit
And the bad luck's on purpose
And if I'm sad, then I deserve it
But underneath the surface, I'm hurtin', searchin', and learnin'
My imperfections may be perfect
Dear insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am?
Oh, insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be just the way I am?
Dear insecurity
I feel like I'm dying on the inside
But I smile it off
I'm a mess, I'm depressed, I'm alone and it's all my fault
Did I do something wrong?
This feeling's unfair
You're making me anxious, but why the fuck do I care?
I overthink everything 'til my thoughts are impaired
I hate everything about me, I think I need some air
Drink some water, take a breath
Take a moment to be thankful for the reasons that you're blessed
It's not about mistakes you made or failures that you had
It's all about the memories and little things you have
Your freckles and flaws, to your body and bruises
Your scars, to your beautiful birth marks, the truth is
We're one in the same, so play the cards that you're dealt
Nobody likes you more than when you're being yourself
Dear insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am?
Oh, insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be just the way I am?
Dear insecurity
I am proud of the person who I am
Nobody's gon' tell me who I am, or who I can be
I am taking my life into my hands
So tired of hiding who I am, I am me
So
Dear insecurity
When you gonna take your hands off me?
When you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am?
Oh, insecurity
It's time I make you take your hands off me
Set me free, I'm gonna let you see
I'm proud of who I am
Just the way I am
I'm proud of who I am
