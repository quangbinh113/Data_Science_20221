Song Name: SNAP
It's 4 a.m., I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you
I just need time
Snapping one, two, where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four, don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
I'm writing a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd, my heart's been on fire
I've been spending my nights in the ring tryna put it out
So I'm snapping one, two, where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four, don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh)
'Cause I might snap (oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap
Snapping one, two, where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (still in my heart)
Snapping three, four, don't need you here anymore (need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might sna-, yeah-yeah-yeah, might snap (oh-ooh-oh-oh)
'Cause I might sna-, yeah-yeah-yeah, might snap (oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Get out of my heart, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, heart (oh-ooh-oh-oh)
'Cause I might snap (oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Get out of my heart, yeah
'Cause I might snap
