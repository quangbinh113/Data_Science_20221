Song Name: Feeling Lonely
I woke up this morning
Feeling lonely
You were gone, and my cellphone too
But what is this feeling?
Empty inside my head
Feels like a heart attack
Oh oh, woah
I miss you so bad
The thought of you makes me sad
I'm going mad (no, I'm not)
Oh oh
Can't help it, I just miss you
How did I lose you now again?
Can't help it, I just miss you
Why did I lose you now again?
Woo
Parapara
Feeling lonely
Parapara
Parapara
I'm feeling lonely
Parapara
You were gone and my cellphone too
You were gone and my cellphone too
Oh oh
Can't help it, I just miss you
How did I lose you now again?
Can't help it, I just miss you
Why did I lose you now again?
Feeling lonely
