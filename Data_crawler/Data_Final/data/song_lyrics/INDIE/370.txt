Song Name: fever dream
Life's a losing game when you don't play
Don't hold your cards too close is what they say
Now, love is just another leap of faith
But I jump right in
I took the train, I took the call
I didn't know just where I'd fall
Or where it'd take me
Another step, another stair
I'll never know if I'll get there
But just maybe
I want something more than
More than restless mornings
Getting by's so boring
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Take another look before it goes
Days are only footprints in the snow
How far away can I walk
Till I'm way too far from home
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I want something more than
More than restless mornings
Getting by's so boring
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Take your time, enjoy it
Every fleeting moment
Getting by's so boring
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
I took the train, I took the car
I didn't know just where I'd fall
Or where it'd take me
Another step, another stair
I'll never know if I'll get there
But just maybe

I want something more than
More than restless mornings

Getting by's so boring
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Take your time, enjoy it
Every fleeting moment
Getting by's so boring
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
