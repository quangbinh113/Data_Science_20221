Song Name: Portland, Maine
I don't wanna be talking on the phone every night
6 p.m., which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where ya are, who you're with
Let's just agree this is it
Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend
That I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
And I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
See, I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
Since you don't know yet, but you won't come back
And I ain't going nowhere, you know that
Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running

I won't pretend
That I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right
Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend
That I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
And I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
