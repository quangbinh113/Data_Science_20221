Song Name: New Girl
Crush, who's got a crush?
I like the way you blush
I like the way you bite
Touch, each time we touch
I wanna take too much
Keep me up all night
I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you
Cash, got hard-earned cash
I like the way you crash
Your lips into mine
Fast, we drive too fast
We got a chequered past
But I can let it slide
I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you
Why'd you cut up all your clothes?
Tell me something no one knows
I don't owe you anything
But you're too much fun to let it rain
Ain't it fun, remembering?
I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you
