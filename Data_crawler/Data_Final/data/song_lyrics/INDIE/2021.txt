Song Name: You Don't Want Me Anymore
Sometimes the truth hurts
More than the lies
My feelings for you
They'll never die
You say I'm perfect
Then wouldn't it be worth it to try
(Are you leaving?)
Again
(Yes)
You're going through shit
Just don't make excuses
You don't want me
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
And you say you love me
But tell him you want him
You say you sorry but then go look for him
Got me so fucked up
You got me so fucked up
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

And maybe
If we met a different time
Things will be different now
Things will be different now
And maybe if we met a different time
Things will be different now
Things will be different now
(How much do you really last)
(Please)
(Please don't let go)
(Don't leave me)
