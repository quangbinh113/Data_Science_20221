Song Name: Too Afraid
I wanna change, but I don't know how
I've been trying to turn my life around
I've been to every party, every bar
Nothing thrills me in this city anymore
I guess I didn't know if I was happy
I can't pretend, I can't pretend
Been feeling like I don't belong, and I see
I've reached an end, I've reached an end
What, well, what can I do?
I hate this city, but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well, why can't I change?
I wanna move on, but I'm just too afraid
Just too afraid, just too afraid
Just too afraid, that's why I stay
Get on the train, I go underground
People look so lonely with eyes turned down
This isn't living, this isn't how I thought my life would be
But I need to get out
Nothing's gonna change the way I feel
I can't pretend, I've reached an end
What, well, what can I do?
I hate this city, but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well, why can't I change?
I wanna move on, but I'm just too afraid
Just too afraid, just too afraid
Just too afraid, that's why I stay
Just too afraid, just too afraid
Just too afraid, that's why I stay
Ah, it could all be different
Ah, in this life
Change your future in an instant
Ah, just to feel alive
What, well, what can I do?
I hate this city, but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well, why can't I change?
I wanna move on, but I'm just too afraid
Just too afraid, just too afraid
Just too afraid, that's why I stay
Just too afraid, just too afraid
Just too afraid, that's why I stay
That's why I stay
That's why I stay
