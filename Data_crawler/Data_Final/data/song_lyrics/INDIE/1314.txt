Song Name: Ghosts
He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says
"These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"
Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying 'I'm still mourning
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you'
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love
So he went crazy at nineteen
Said he'd lost all his self esteem
And couldn't understand why he was crying
He would stare at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts that broke his heart.
Oh the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
Oh the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love
He says 'I'm so lost,
Not at all well'
Ooh
Ooh
After it was done when there was nothing left to be
Turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
After it was done after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each other's shoulder
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I ever believed in
Everlasting love
