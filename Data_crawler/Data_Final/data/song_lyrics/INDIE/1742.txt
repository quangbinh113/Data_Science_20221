Song Name: Take My Picture
Take my picture
Listen real close
You might figure
I fit you the most
Send me spinning
You're giving your all
When you're swimming in the deep
You won't be afraid to fall
Said you never had a kiss like mine
Run your hands from my neck back to spine
In the middle of the room
Everything's blurry except for you
How I love it when you do what you do to me
Forget your name but I don't feel the need to ask
Cause I'm so caught up in the moment â€“ time is flying over
I'm a little hazy, I don't feel the same
Normally I'm shy now I don't feel ashamed
Today is different
You make it different for me
Take my picture
Listen real close
You might figure
I fit you the most
Send me spinning
You're giving your all
When you're swimming in the deep
You won't be afraid to fall
Heaven, I been here before
(Seems like a dream now, don't it?)
Silhouettes on my bedroom floor now
Strike a pose, don't you hide the excitement
Got me dying for your attention baby
Oh I love the way you move when you're talking cheap
Think we'll find a way to leave the party
Soon enough you'll walk me through your door
And then we'll see who knows
Take a photo for the memory
One that I will keep for all my reveries
You got my interest
And you make it different for me
Take my picture
Listen real close
You might figure
I fit you the most
Send me spinning
You're giving your all
When you're swimming in the deep
You won't be afraid to fall
Listen closely
To my body
Break it free and
Listen closely to me
Take my picture
Listen real close
You might figure
I fit you the most
Send me spinning
You're giving your all
When you're swimming in the deep
You won't be afraid to fall
Take my picture
Listen
Closely to my body
Figure
Fit you
More than I thought I would
Spinning
This is
All that I was wanting
Listen to me swimming in your mind
Take my picture
Listen real close
You might figure
I fit you the most
Send me spinning
You're giving your all
When you're swimming in the deep
You won't be afraid to fall
