Song Name: Palomino
We go traveling down this highway line
See you in every corner of my mind
Nobody else in this nowhere town
I've been dragging your ghost around
Where you go my love goes, darling
I can hear the unknown road calling
So, let the winds carry you home, my darling
For where I go your love goes, darling
Closing my eyes I can hear the fanfare
Drums and whistles, anticipation in the air
All the what-ifs, they're a cross I'll have to bear
I have to leave you now and pretend that I don't care
Where you go my love goes, darling
I can hear the unknown road calling
So, let the winds carry you home, my darling
For where I go your love goes, darling
I want to ride off on a palomino
Feel the fire in my breath and the breeze in my hair as I go
Why the hell am I even looking back for?
For I know, where you go my love goes
For I know, where you go my love goes
Where you go my love goes, darling
I can hear the unknown road calling
So, let the winds carry you home, my darling
For where I go your love goes, darling
Gonna let the sun shine down
This nowhere town
The winds carry you home
Gonna let the sun shine down
This nowhere town
I'm heading out to roam
Gonna let the sun shine down
This nowhere town
The winds carry you home
Gonna let the sun shine down
This nowhere town
I'm heading out to roam
