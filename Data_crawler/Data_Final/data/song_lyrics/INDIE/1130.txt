Song Name: I Will Spend My Whole Life Loving You
Ooooo
Ooo ah ooooo
Ooo ah ooooo
Ooooo
August Afternoon
I can picture you
A-walking with your father at your side
In the summer heat
California speaks Softly
Like she's making up her mind
And now
As I stand beside you I say
Baby
Isn't it crazy
That we are born
Only to die
Oh believe me
I've been counting my stars
Cause I will spend my whole life
Loving you
(Ooooo)
(Ooo ah ooo)
Through your shining eyes
Sweet like Jeffery Pie
I pretended I could read your thoughts
Now it's just the truth
Seems our hearts are fused
Sudden
Like the goal your sister brought
And how
Am I lucky enough to say
Baby
Isn't it crazy
That we are born
Only to die
Oh believe me
I've been counting my stars
Cause I will spend my whole life
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
And I say Baby
Isn't it crazy
We are born
Only to die
Oh believe me
I've been counting my stars
Cause I will spend my whole life
Loving you
