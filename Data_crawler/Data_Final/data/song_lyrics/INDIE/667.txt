Song Name: The Fine Print
Welcome to space
What were you expecting?
It's a dangerous place
Thank you for investing
Go there for your rota
There for your orders
Fill up these quotas
We'll bill for your quarters
Report to your foreman
But watch for marauders
'Cause if you get eaten
There's fees for your mourners
Prosperity's there in the care of magnates
In Halcyon heaven awaits!
Did you think it was supposed to
Look like the poster?
It mostly does
Oh, if you'd only read closer
Just ten short years to a new frontier
Snooze as you cruise
And you'll wake up here!
You've been trapped in that ship
For an awful long time
So perhaps you have simply forgot what you signed
Oh, honestly?
Did you not read the colony policy?
That defines you as company property?
That waivers your say in autonomy?
The conglomerate's got you in lock and key
We put the dollar back into idolatry
If you're upset, you can rent an apology
We are a family forged in bureaucracy
No "I" in "team," but there's "con" in "economy"
Were you expecting adventure?
Were you hoping for fun?
My friend, you're indentured
And pleasure's exempt from your tenure
So venture back down to your slum
That's provided at generous prices
Your worth is determined by your sacrifices
A small term of service when down on the surface
Internment's a freebie that comes with the purchase
We work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to give
Ourselves the right to buy
Ourselves the right to live
To earn the right to die
Welcome to our little town
Why don't you settle down?
Here, just fill out the paperwork
And you can look around
We're happy as can be
Inside the valley cannery
We live to pack the cans of meat
And not to question where it's found
Until we end up in the ground
Around the corner in the yard
You know, we thought we liked the sound
Of finding glory in the stars
The board has taught us to be proud
Of never reaching very far
So we earn what we're allowed
And give it right back at the bar
The ale to cure what ails ya
Zero Gee Brew, your favourite flavour
So work 'til you bleed, ennobled by labour
Then purchase relief from your local retailer!
If you'd rather drop dead, that's fine
But you know that dropping down dead bears a fine
So you do your job and I'll do mine
I gotta meet a six foot deep bottom line
We make a fortune for the board
By selling boredom door to door
Because it's all that we deserve
And it is all we can afford
The secrets of the universe
And all the worlds to be explored
But our dreams are back on Earth
And now the work is our reward
And you'll be grateful
For seats at the table
Though it dips at one end
And the bench is unstable
You may waste your days
But at least you were able
To pay off your grave
Since we leased you your cradle
Be faithful and pray
We'll repay what you invest
Behave as you slave
For humanity's interest
On account that you're all on account
And we're quickly amounting
Humanity's interest
You'd think that we'd sink
To the brink of rebellion
With markets dependent
On peddling weapons
The architect tells them
The secret to Heaven
Is simply consuming
Whatever we sell them
We work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to work
To earn the right to give
Ourselves the right to buy
Ourselves the right to live
To earn the right to die
You should have read the fine print, my friend
Should have read the fine print
You should have read the fine print, my friend
Should have read the fine print
Welcome to our little town
Why don't you settle down?
Here, just fill out the paperwork
And you can look around
We work and then we work
And then we work and then we work
And then we work and then we work
And then we end up in the ground
Welcome to our little town
Why don't you settle down?
Here, just fill out the paperwork
And you can look around
You should have read the fine print, my friend
Should have read the fine print
Here and here and initial here
Welcome to the family!
