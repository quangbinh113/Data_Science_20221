Song Name: safety
I bet you never knew (bet you never knew)
That you'd be my safety, yeah (baby)
I bet you never knew (knew), on my lonely nights
It all comes back to you (ah, yeah, baby)
I bet (I bet) you know (you know)
When it's alright for me to come home again
I love a friend like you, you
Sometimes, I wonder why (sometimes I wonder why)
I like to live inside (I like to live inside)
I'm someone who holds back the rain, oh
I bet (I bet) it's real (it's real), you posin', my baby
I try from time-to-time, oh, to hold back
These lonely nights, but that
And I know, we'd be somethin' if we tried
I bet you never knew (bet you, bet you)
That you'd be my safety (safety, safety), yeah
I bet you never knew (never knew, yeah), on my lonely nights
It all falls back to you, oh (back, ah-ah-ah)
You saved my soul, reminded me of
Why love's so blue, two trees of green
To all of me, I've been down for so long
My love, my love, I'm holding out, oh baby (ha-ah-ah)
You saved my soul (saved my soul), reminded me of
Why love's so blue, two trees of green, oh
To all of me, I've been down for so long
My love, my love, I'm holdin' out, oh baby
