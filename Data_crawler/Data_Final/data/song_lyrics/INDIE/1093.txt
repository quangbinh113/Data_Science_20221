Song Name: this is what falling in love feels like
Feel like sun on my skin
So this is love, I know it is
I know I sound super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
I got a lot on my mind
Got some more on my plate
My baby got me looking forward to the end of the day
What you say? You and me?
Just forget about the past, throw it in the trash
What you say? You and me?
Live the life we never had, like we're never going back
Feel like sun on my skin
So this is love, I know it is
I know I sound super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love
I know I sound super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love...
Yeah
This is falling, falling in love
Ooh...
This is falling, falling in love
