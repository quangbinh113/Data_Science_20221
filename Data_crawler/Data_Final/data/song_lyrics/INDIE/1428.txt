Song Name: From These Heights
So lost, my dear
I'll always find some way to drown and weigh you down
There's no one out here
I'm searching for the furthest flight away from here
And I'm a stranger in this country
Where the city sounds have died
There was a time when you were a child and could smile acres wide
But it's a battle inside
I've never felt so far from something in my life
To fall from these heights
I need somewhere to sеttle down and find my feet
You go from being so intact to broken in a blink
I'll diе trying to pry my way inside that private mind
But violence is all you'll find in here
Landmines and lightning strikes
Countless riots, wildfires
This heart wants to retire, and in their eyes you seem alright
But that's a lie
'Cause it's a battle inside
I've never felt so far from something in my life
To fall from these heights
I need somewhere to settle down and find my feet
You go from being so intact to broken in a blink
But it's a battle inside
I've never felt so far from something in my life
To fall from these heights
But it's a battle inside
I've never felt so far from something in my life
To fall from these heights
I need somewhere to settle down and find my feet
You go from being so intact to broken in a blink
