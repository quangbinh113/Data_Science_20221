Song Name: Best Part (feat. H.E.R.)
Oh, ey
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh
I just wanna see, I just wanna see
How beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part
O-o-o-oh
Best part
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire(eeh)
When we wake up(up)
And then we make love(make love)
It makes me feel so nice
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life
I just wanna see
How beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part
O-o-o-oh
Your the best part
O-o-o-oh
Best part(your the best part)
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you, won't you
If you love me won't you say something(say something)
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something(say something)
If you love me, won't you, ahhh
If you love me won't you say something(say something)
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something(say something)
If you love me, won't you, ahhh
If you love me won't you say something(say something)
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
