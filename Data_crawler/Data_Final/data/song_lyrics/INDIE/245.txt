Song Name: Sun Tan
Okay, I'm a fucking loser
Who doesn't want to talk to you

Okay, I'll take a little time
To care about what you do

Why does the sun set, baby?
I'm tryna to get my sun tan
I feel I'm always sinking
Tell me where you, you want it
Down in the city
How can I explain it to you
When I can't talk at all?
Fuck, I'm kinda cross-faded now
I'm trying not to fall
Spending all this time by myself
Just shopping at the mall
You just want to talk it all out
But I ignored your call
Okay, times are really changing
And I can't afford myself
Okay, tell me where to go
And darling, I'll be there
Why does the sun shine, baby?
I'm tryna heal my sunburn
I feel I'm always ageing
Tell me I was something
Tell me it's nothing
How can I explain it to you
When I can't talk at all?
Fuck, I'm kinda cross-faded now
I'm trying not to fall
Spending all this time by myself
Just shopping at the mall
You just want to talk it all out
But I ignored your call
How can I explain it to you
When I can't talk at all?
Fuck, I'm kinda cross-faded now
I'm trying not to fall
Spending all this time by myself
Just shopping at the mall
You just want to talk it all out
But I ignored your call
Now you're at the range
Hitting balls of shame
Can't you see I'm okay?
When you say it's wrong
Don't let me sing along
I can't erase my memory
Don't tell me where to be
Or tell me what to see
Don't you know I'm faded
