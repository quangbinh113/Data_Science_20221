Song Name: no, the moon
The sun is hidden
Behind the clouds
The sun goes down
I see it fall
I write your name
At the grocery store
I want to see
What it's like to be you
I'm lying down
It's raining now
When things are gone
You can't have them back
I close my eyes
It's late at night
I hope I won't
Have that dream again
