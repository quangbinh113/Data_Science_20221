Song Name: Arms
What can I give that is all for you?
My heart's no good 'cause it's split in two
What can I give that is all for you?
These arms are all I have
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
What can I give that is all for you?
My heart's no good 'cause it's split in two
What can I give that is all for you?
These arms are all I have
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
