Song Name: Passenger Seat
I-l-l, I-l-l-I
I-l-l, I-l-l-I
I, I, I, I wanna ride in the passenger seat
I wanna ride in the passenger seat
I, I
I, I
I, I
I, I
I, I
Switched places to redeem yourself
You call the shots, couldn't wait
Be cautious of the path you take
If I let go, will you?
Drive me home safe
Drive us home safe
Drive me
Home safe
Drive us
Home safe
I, I
I, I
Be cautious
Be cautious
I, I
I, I
Drive us
Home safe
I, I
I, I
I, I
I-l-l
I, I
Be cautious
Be cautious
I wanna ride in the passenger seat
Now, watch me ride in the passenger seat
