Song Name: chance with you
Oh, I've heard all about you
All those things they had to say
You're a legend 'round this school
Locally famous drama queen
Turn my eyes, I see you stare
Cross the room and right at me
Now you're smiling like you've got
Like you've got something on your mind
You're so beautiful
I don't want to turn away
You've been here before
Make me feel like you're a
Wild animal, shaking, I am your prey
I'm all you want
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
I'd risk it all
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
Just so I could have a chance with you
With you
You are always on my mind
Sitting here, I am waiting
Ones like you, they make me shy
Innocently intimidating
I still can't figure you out
You're the kind that drives me mad
Are you here looking for love?
Or do you love being looked at?
You're so beautiful
I don't want to turn away
You've been here before
Make me feel like I'm a
Wild animal, shaking, you are my prey
You're all I want
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
I'd risk it all
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
Just so I could have a chance with you
With you
With you
