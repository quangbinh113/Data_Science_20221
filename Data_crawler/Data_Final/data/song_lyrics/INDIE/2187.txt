Song Name: Porcelain
Mumbling
"Edelweiss"

I couldn't catch
Your eyes

"Mama
What went wrong?
Forgot why I'm still here
Silent calls"
You slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
I don't feel anything at all
Morning
Red like wine
Got me trapped under
Venetian blinds

One more
Piece of cake
Round and round they go
I'm porcelain
You slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
I don't feel anything at all
