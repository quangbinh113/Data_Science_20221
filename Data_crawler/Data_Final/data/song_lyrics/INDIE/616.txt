Song Name: Island Song (Come Along with Me) [feat. Ashley Eriksson]
Come along with me
And the butterflies and bees
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Come along with me
To a cliff under a tree
Where we can gaze upon the water
As an everlasting dream
All of my collections
I'll share them all with you
Maybe by next summer
We won't have changed our tunes
I still want to be
With the butterflies and bees
Making up new numbers
And living so merrily
All of my collections
I'll share them all with you
I'll be here for you always
And always be with you
Come along with me
And the butterflies and bees
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Living so merrily
