Song Name: What Does It Mean To Me?
Throw it in the trash, let it go for now
Am I so sentimental I can't live without it?
Take a second, no, a minute, no, an hour
Just a night to sit down to think about it
What does it mean to me?
What does it mean to me?
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
Had another dream I woke up lying next to you
Felt like my waking life's not quite enough to get me through
But every letter, every photo, every note
That had you in it had me feeling confused
I feel you here when you're not around
I hear your voice when there's not sound
I'm laughing and I'm crying, and I'm orange and I'm blue
Can one be one without two?
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? What does it mean to me?
What does it mean to me? What does itâ€“
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
What does it mean to me? (what does it mean to me?)
