Song Name: Pigeon
Circling around the kitchen
Why has nothing changed?
Feed cucumber sandwich to a pigeon
Chipping nail varnish on guitar strings
Got a pillow case made out of money
Feelin' pretty fake when I wake up
Tissue paper castle paper caddy
Scaly little friend's got my backup
Didn't give me time to say goodbye in the way that I wanted to
So honey, close your eyes and stay like you're supposed to do
Don't you wanna give me time to write another song for you?
Fuzzy feeling and I miss you
Why can nothing stay the same
Fucking stupid and I'm gonna kill you
Melt all your art and drink the paint
I am not a beast, I'm not a monster
I don't care what you say
You can't have the bad guys without a hero
And I'm the only one who's got a cape
Didn't give me time to say goodbye in the way that I wanted to
So honey, close your eyes and stay like you're supposed to do
Don't know how I'm gonna live without, but I'll stay strong for you
