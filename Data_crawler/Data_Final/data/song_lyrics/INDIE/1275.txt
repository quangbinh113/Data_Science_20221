Song Name: Good Girls (Donâ€™t Get Used)
Say you miss me, say you wanna kiss me
I liked it better when you improvised the story we had
If you adore me, why do you ignore me?
I liked it better when you sent me sorry when I was sad
Stop saying, "It's my bad"
You're acting like your deadbeat dad
I know, you know you're better than that
But you can't respond when you react
I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you
I started letting go
You let me know you were just confused
And I still think that you're cute
But I need you to remember that
Good girls don't get used

Good girls don't get used
Good girls don't get-
Say you want me, actually, you want me
Did you want a ribbon?
'Cause I'm gonna need to hear more than that
Gotta show me if you wanna know me
Maybe you would know by now
I'm the greatest thing you could have
Stop saying, "It's my bad"
Forgetting everything we had
I know, you know you're better than that
But you can't respond when you react
I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you
I started letting go
You let me know you were just confused
And I still think that you're cute
But I need you to remember that
Good girls don't get used

Good girls don't get used

Good girls don't get-
Who's the girl in your story?
Hard to believe that you really care at all if
When you're bored or you're horny
I wanna hang out but you're busy hunting down a booty call
Hate it how you ignore me
Like for the weekend, but then pretend nothing happened, is that so?
'Cause I asked to come over
But supposedly a girl that's just your friend was in your home
I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
