Song Name: Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat
I do not want to fight this anymore
I just want to lay back
And watch you pin me to the bed
I used to call you my best friend
Way back before you were my everything
Now I'm sucking your neck
And you wrote my favorite song
Now I'm fucked up and carrying on
I do not know the words to it yet, oh
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do
Like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do
Like me
Yeah
Tell me that nobody else touches you
Like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
Tell me that nobody else touches you
Like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
You're pulling on my habit lines
The more I smoke the more I find
I can't just fall asleep instead
And you're not my protector
I hope you know it wasn't her
That kept me off your side of the bed, oh
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you
Like I do
Like I do
Like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you
Like I do
Like I do
Like me
You're in his living room
And it may not mean much you
But your plates are in his sink
And your sweater's on his bed
Won't you text me when you're home?
My baby, spare me all the rest
Please just tell me
That nobody else touches you like I do
Oh tell me that nobody else touches you like me
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you
Like I do
Like I do
Like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want
Anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do
Like me
