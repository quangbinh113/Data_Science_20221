Song Name: Someone To Spend Time With
Wake up alone
In the morning, with no one at my side
Could it be
I've waited too long, waiting for the lucky one
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend my time with
To give and share all my love
Back in bed
It's 3 a.m with no one at my side
It gets real cold

Because these blankets
Will never warm my heart
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share my love
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone spend time with
To give and share all my love
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
