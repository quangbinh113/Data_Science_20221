Song Name: OH GOD
I always think of love when I see you
And I don't wanna think about love right now
It hurt me so much to need you
Living with some pain I could live without
Don't know why we called this a break
Don't know why we said we'd talk soon
Don't think that I'd call this a date
I'm fixing my hair in the bathroom
Oh God, I'm sitting in my car again
Oh God, I think that you hate me
July, I swear that you never end
August, would you just keep me busy?
The party's winding down, we're making small talk
And everything I'm saying tastes like backwash
Three-word questions and two-word answers
Oh God, I'm taking things too far again
Of course, I know you don't hate me
I swore to let you know and let you in but
Oh God, I'm sitting in my car again
Oh God, I'm sitting in my car again
Oh God, I think that you hate me
July, I swear that you never end
August, would you just keep me busy?
Oh God, I'm sitting in my car again
Oh God, I think that you hate me
July, I swear that you never end
August, would you just keep me busy?
And thank God I got no one to bother
Thank God I got no one to blame for this
In six months, I was screaming underwater
In ten years, I'll forget your name
(I'm sorry)
