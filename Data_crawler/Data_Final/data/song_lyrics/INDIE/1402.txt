Song Name: Send Me
Send me, sun at dawn
Gonna let it heal some more
Let me heal and now I'm sure
Now I'm sure, now I'm sure
Let me heal and now I'm sure
Now I'm sure, now I'm sure
Believe and now I'm sure
Let me heal and now I'm sure
I'm sure, I'm sure
And now I'm sure
Your remedy from yesterday still going on
Now ordinary to me, still going on and on
And on and on and on and on
Let me, let me heal, then wait for more
Let me, let me heal, wait some more
Baby, don't be long, need more to feel strong
Need more to feel strong
Better let it heal
Send me some more
Better let it heal
Send me some more
Some more
Some more
Send me (send me)
Zombie (zombie)
Call me (call me)
Zombie (zombie)
Send me (send me)
Love me (love me)
Send me (send me)
Zombie (zombie)
Call me (call me)
Zombie (zombie)
Send me (send me)
Love me (love me)

Let it heal some, some more
Better let it in some more, some more
Better let it heal so warm, so warm
Better let it heal so warm, so warm, so warm, so warm, so warm
