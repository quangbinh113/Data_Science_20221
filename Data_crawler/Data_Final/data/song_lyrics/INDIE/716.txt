Song Name: Pinky Promise
I gotta ask you a question
Can you see through me
See how I'm feeling
Is it easy to tell?
'Cause you're making plans and it's starting to scare me
I don't think you notice I'm not doing well
You know me, I've been patient
It's been hard
It's wearing me down
So I'm sorry
But caring 'bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I Promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly boy I don't even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
We're both in different places
And I need some space
And we're probably better not talking at all
'Cause maybe I don't deserve you
I don't wanna hurt you
Can't give you a smile if it's just for a show
You know me, I've been patient
It's been hard
It's wearing me down
(It's wearing me down)
So I'm sorry
But caring 'bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I Promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly boy I don't even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
Hey I'm really sorry
I don't know why we're fighting and I really fucking hate it
It's just scary
I don't like it
And I just wanna talk
We talked about a future but now it's in the past
I don't regret the memories but knew they wouldn't last
I know that it's not easy to give up what we had
I made myself a promise and I'm not looking back
So I'm sorry
But caring 'bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I Promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly boy I don't even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do
Never do
But I promise you
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
I pinky promise I don't love you anymore
Anymore
I don't love you anymore
