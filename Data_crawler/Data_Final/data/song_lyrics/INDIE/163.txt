Song Name: Don't Stop
We could get out of here
Away form everyone
Do a million other things
I can think of one
Or two, three, four
Hands in my hair
Your lips on mine
No shirt, no blouse
Last check out time
In the end I just wanna get you all to myself
We could just leave and go somewhere else
Woah-oh
Don't stop, keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
Don't stop keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
What do I need to say?
No need to overthink
We could get out of here
And have another drink
Or two, three, four
Hands in my hair
Your lips on mine
No shirt, no blouse
Last check out time
In the end I just wanna get you all to myself
We could just leave and go somewhere else
Woah-oh
Don't stop, keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
Don't stop keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
Hands in my hair
Your lips on mine
No shirt, no blouse
Last check out time
In the end I just wanna get you all to myself
We could just leave and go somewhere else
Woah-oh
Don't stop, keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
Don't stop keep doing what you're doing
Don't stop 'cause I like it like that
Hands in my hair
Your lips on mine
No shirt, no blouse
Last check out time
In the end I just wanna get you all to myself
We could just leave and go somewhere else
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
