Song Name: better off
We know that this won't last
Not like it used to
And I'm okay with that
But not if I lose you
I can feel it in my bones
Sinking deeper in the overflow
Can you feel it in your soul?
If I'm honest
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off
Maybe we're better off alone
Maybe we're better off
I won't turn my back
Now that you want to
And if there's nothing left
Why does it haunt you, oh
I can feel it take control
Falling further in the undertow
Can you feel it in your soul?
If I'm honest
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off
Maybe we're better off alone
Maybe we're better off
I can feel it in my bones
Running circles
'Cause you're all I know
And I feel it in my soul
If I'm honest
