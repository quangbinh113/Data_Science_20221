Song Name: curse,
Your Twisted Fog
Mixed Ivory Tones
I Will Be Frank
I'm Far From Home
Your Harvest Comes
From Someone's Field
Their Blood Poured Out
And Painted the Yield
Can You Blame Me
For Loving Your Sweet Words?
I Did Not Know
I Signed a Curse
You Cut Down Trees
To Build Bridges There
But Concrete Life
Is Void of Air
This Time I'm Gone
I've Lost Remorse
I'll Save It for the Judge
On the White Horse
Can You Blame Me
For Loving Your Sweet Words?
I Did Not Know
I Signed a Curse
