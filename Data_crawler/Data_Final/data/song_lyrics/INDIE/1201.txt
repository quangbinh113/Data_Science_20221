Song Name: When - Live
I think I've been telling lies
'Cause I've never been in love
Everyone falls for the sunshine disguise
Distracted by who they're thinking of
I'd rather date an idea
Something I'll never find
Sure, I'll live in the moment
But I'm never happy here
I'm surrounded by greener looking time
Am I the only one
Wishing life away?
Never caught up in the moment
Busy begging the past to stay
Memories painted with much brighter ink
They tell me I loved, teach me how to think
I'll take what I can get
'Cause I'm too damp for a spark
Kissing sickly sweet guys
'Cause they say they like my eyes
But I'd only ever see them in the dark
I'm sick of faking diary entries
Got to get it in my head, I'll never be sixteen again
And I'm waiting to live, and waiting to love
Oh it'll be over, and I'll still be asking when
Am I the only one
Wishing life away?
Never caught up in the moment
Busy begging the past to stay
Memories painted with much brighter ink
They tell me I loved, teach me how to think
I'm sick of faking diary entries
Got to get it in my head, I'll never be sixteen again
I'm waiting to live, and waiting to love
Oh it'll be over, and I'll still be asking when
Oh it'll be over, and I'll still be asking when
