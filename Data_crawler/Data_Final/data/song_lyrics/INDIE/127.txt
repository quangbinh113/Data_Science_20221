Song Name: Taking Care of Things
Where do the boys go when it gets cold out?
Do they have a place to sleep?
Where did their mums go? Did they get taken?
Or had they had enough of taking care of things?
It's hard to say if someone's at fault
If I don't do anything, is it my fault?
Where do the girls go when they feel frightened?
Do they have something to eat?
Where did their dads go? Did they get taken?
Or had they had enough of taking care of things?
I've gotta find a way to make this feel okay
When rock bottom for me is routine for someone else
I'm gonna take care of things
There's things I need to sort out
I'm gonna take care of things
'Cause they're not where I want them right now
I know there's good in everything
And it'll show itself when you're gentle to it
I'm gonna take care of things
Where does my mind go when it gets stupid?
Is there anyone in there?
Where did my friends go? Did they get taken?
Or had they had enough of going to therapy?
Sat in a cold room, the corners feel friendly
I think they'll take care of me
My brothers are circles, my sisters quadrilaterals
And they're all so pretty
I'm gonna take care of things
There's things I need to sort out
I'm gonna take care of things
They're not where I need them right now
I know there's good in everything
And it'll show itself when you're gentle to it
I'm gonna take care of things
I'm gonna take care of things
