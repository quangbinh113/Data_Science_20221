Song Name: Stayed at the Party
One day we'll all be gone
No trace left of this song
You and me
Ashes and dust
All that's left of us
And that's been on my mind
No answers there to find
Silly me
Thinking too much
There's no medicine
To put inside our cups
To keep us here long enough but
I'd like to put a fight up
So, I'll just stay at the party
Dance 'til my feet hurt
Tell all my friends I love them for no reason
Just so that one day
When I'm not near them
They might remember tonight it's alright
'Cause we stayed at the party
Maybe I've got it wrong
I know something else beyond
It'll be you and I together again our kindred by our sides (our sides)
It's been on my mind (my mind)
We're running out of time
Silly me
Can't get it right (can't get it right)
There's no medicine
To put inside our cups
To keep us here long enough but
I'd like to put a fight up
So, I'll just stay at the party
Dance 'til my feet hurt
Tell all my friends I love them for no reason
Just so that one day
When I'm not near them
They might remember tonight it's alright
'Cause we stayed at the party
The time will come when I'm alone
Flying somewhere never to return, no, no
Will I have my memories of home?
Will I be scared of the unknown?
Who knows?
Who knows?
So, I'll just stay at the party
Smile 'til my cheeks hurt
Tell all my friends I love them for no reason
Just so that one day
When I'm not near them
They will remember tonight it's alright 'cause I stayed...
