Song Name: No Mercy (feat. BlackGryph0n & LittleJayneyCakes)
This is the worst team I have ever played with in my life
When we finally get on the point everyone dies
I understand that every now and then a team won't click
When it comes to you, I don't think I can sympathise
You should've picked Mercy
You should've picked any kind of support
We ended up losing
And it's all your fault
You should learn how this game works
You should've been helping
"If you like Mercy so much, why don't you just marry her?"
So you're the type that gets a mic and tries to lecture me
You're the most useless person we have on our team
I've never seen anybody rage quite as hard as you
Maybe you should go back to playing Team Fortress 2
I'm not gonna be Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing
And you got all mad
Your tears are what I live for
You should've been Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing and it's all your fault
Your tears are what I live for
Maybe I'll be Tracer
I'm already Tracer
What about Widowmaker?
I'm already Widowmaker
I'll be Bastion
Nerf Bastion!
You're right, so Winston
I wanna be Winston
I guess I'll be Genji
I'm already Genji
Then I'll be McCree
I already chose McCree
I have an idea
What's your idea?
You should be
I'm not gonna be Mercy
You should've picked Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing and it's all your fault
Your tears are what I live for
I'm not gonna be Mercy
You should've picked any kind of support
We ended up losing and you got all mad
You should learn how this game works
