Song Name: Elevator
I go up, go down
Go, go up, go down
Ow, seriously, ow (ow)
Samurai sword to the chest right now
I got glitter in my teardrops, kisses on the ground (drip, drip)
Yeah, you're talking my ear off, bringing me down
Try reading my lips
(I don't want you, I don't need you)
I'm pressing the switch
(On the rooftop, I need two shots and then)
Four, five and then six
I'll check you off of my list
And it sounds something like this
I go up, go down in my elevator
Don't wanna talk right now, see you, alligator
Load me up in a sling shot, send me over the moon
Baby, I can be a big shot, too, too, too, too
I go up, go down in my elevator
I let the boom go bang, hit the detonator
Load me up in a sling shot, send me over the moon
Baby, I can be a big shot too, too, too, too
Ooh, take out the drama
Call your mama, call it karma
I don't wanna dance with you
Road to Nirvana
Don't need no one here in my ele-ele-ele
Try reading my lips
(I don't want you, I don't need you)
I'm pressing the switch
(On the rooftop, I need two shots and then)
Four, five and then six
I'll check you off of my list
And it sounds something like this
(One, two, uh)
I go up, go down in my elevator
Don't wanna talk right now, see you, alligator
Load me up in a sling shot, send me over the moon
Baby, I can be a big shot, too, too, too, too
I go up, go down in my elevator
I let the boom go bang, hit the detonator
Load me up in a sling shot, send me over the moon
Baby, I can be a big shot too, too, too, too
Eleva-eleva-elevator, eleva-eleva-elevator
Eleva-eleva-elevator, eleva-eleva-elevator
Eleva-eleva-elevator, eleva-eleva-elevator
Eleva-eleva-elevator, eleva-eleva-elevator
