Song Name: Been Like This
Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
Ever since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
See you've been changing, baby
In good ways and bad ways
Can't say what I say, it's far too late
And I think you made me, baby
Made me too nervous
Crying and this hurt and I gotta tell you why
Since you've been like this (this, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (this, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this, this)
Who is fronting, babe?
We don't have fun these days
It's more than complicated, I
(Couldn't say you wasn't with it)
Told me to stop my mind
When you gave up, I tried
I gave you all this time
Gave you my everything
Said I can do this all night, baby
Said I was actin' out of line, maybe
Can't put my trauma to the side
When you told me I was lyin'
Had me feelin' like I died, baby
I seen a grown man cry, baby
Just see you do it, ain't special, no
Wonder when I ain't there
What the fuck you've been sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout how I sexed you up
And I know it might mess you up
Hatin' me ain't gon' get you love
Ain't nobody gon' set you up
I ain't even gon' sweat you, love
And we'll never be friends like this
God couldn't forgive like this
Way I really went in like this
Thank God I ain't been like this (yeah)
Since you've been like this (this, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (this, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this, this)
Since you've been like this
I, bless your heart (like this)
But I, I can't take no more (like this)
I, bless your heart (like this)
But I, I can't take no more
Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
