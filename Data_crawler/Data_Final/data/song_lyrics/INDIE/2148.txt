Song Name: ALLERGIC
It got old, following you around
Trying to get you to talk to me (mm)
And it got old, wanted to let you in
But you didn't want to fix shit (no-no)
I've been burned before ya
But there's just something about us
That doesn't hurt to give this up
Or maybe I, maybe I
I'm allergic to love, that don't love me back
Because lately, I don't miss a thing about what we had
And if I never saw you in my life again
Maybe I'd even forget
The way that loving you felt
Like I was allergic
After all the things that you put me through
With so little left to lose, I got over you
I've been burned before ya
But there's just something about us
That doesn't hurt to give this up
Or maybe I, maybe I
I'm allergic to love, that don't love me back
Because lately, I don't miss a thing about what we had
And if I never saw you in my life again
Maybe I'd even forget
The way that loving you felt
Like I was allergic
