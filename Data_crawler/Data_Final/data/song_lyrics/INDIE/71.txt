Song Name: ferrari
Millions of ghosts have walked my streets
Where did they go?
Where did they go?
Pages of myself now bite my skin
A village turned cold
Why are they cold?
Oh, my words have turned to stone
It's like I got a body in the back of my Ferrari that I don't even own
I should've left it alone
Maybe if you took my lungs away
I wouldn't breathe the air that makes me say
The things that will haunt me the very next day
Maybe if you took my mouth away
Zip my lips and throw the key away
The millions of eyes that look on me like I killed a man
Would finally subside
My words have turned to stone
It's like I got a body in the back of my Ferrari that I don't even own
I should've left it alone
Millions of ghosts have walked my streets
Where did they go?
Where did they go?
Three little pigs, I'm the big bad wolf
The talk of the town is that I came and blew it down
I never blew it down
Ugh
Maybe if you took my mouth away
Zip my lips and throw the key away
The millions of eyes that look on me like I killed a man
Would finally subside
My words have turned to stone
It's like I got a body in the back of my Ferrari that I don't even own
I should've left it alone
Take my secrets burned at the stake
I got one last chance before it's too late
To restore my reputation
My only chance of saving
Maybe if you took my lungs away
I wouldn't breathe the air that makes me say
The things that will haunt me the very next day
Maybe if you took my mouth away
Zip my lips and throw the key away
The millions of eyes that look on me like I killed a man
Would finally subside
My words have turned to stone
It's like I got a body in the back of my Ferrari that I don't even own
I should've left it alone
