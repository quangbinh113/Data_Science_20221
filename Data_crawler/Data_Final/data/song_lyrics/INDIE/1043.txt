Song Name: Swim
I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've got to work shit out, baby
I'm exorcising demons, got 'em running 'round the block now
Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil, and you lucked out (yuh)
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim
Pop a couple pills in the daytime, uh
Heard you got a friend, what her head like? Uh
Probably should've fucked on the first night, uh
Now I gotta wait for the green light, uh
I don't wanna wait for no green light, uh
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright, uh
Luckily, I float at insane heights, yeah
Luckily, luckily, luckily, yah
Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out, uh
You picked a dance with the devil, and you lucked out, yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim
Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no
I know I said I'd call, I never did, no
Swim, swim now
I can take you even though I've never been there
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again, yeah
I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim
