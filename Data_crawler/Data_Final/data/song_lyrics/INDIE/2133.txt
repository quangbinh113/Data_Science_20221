Song Name: Exscape
Girl, tell me
Girl, tell me
Girl, just don't know no more
Oh, girl, my no, no, no
Met you in a bad place
Thought you were an escape
Now I can't escape your grasp
I don't know how long this escape will last
Met you in a bad place
Thought you were an escape
Now I can't escape your grasp
I don't know how long this escape will last
I'm so tired of you, girl
You don't know just what you do to me
I am cryin' through ya
Can't get through, can't get close to you, girl
Met you in a bad place
Thought you were an escape
Now I can't escape your grasp
I don't know how long this escape will last
Met you in a bad place
Thought you were an escape
Now I can't escape your grasp
I don't know how long this escape will last
