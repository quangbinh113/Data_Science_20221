Song Name: Fvck Somebody
What do you want?
My God
I just wanna go somewhere without you
What do you want?
My God
I just wanna love someone who's not you
But here we are
Living it up in Wellsville, New York
And I can't tell
If this is Hell, or if I'm just bored
You said, "Let's settle down"
Sounds like a downfall
I gotta get out
Without it being my fault
I wish you'd fuck somebody
Steal my money
Break my heart
Say you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever loved me
Could I be so lucky?
Let me off the hook
I really wish you would
I wish you'd fuck somebody
I wish you'd fuck somebody
What do I want?
My God
I just get so restless laying in your garage
I dream 'til the sun
Comes up
I wonder how it looks when it shines over Taiwan
But here we are
Where we grew up in Wellsville, New York
And that would be fine
But the back of my mind says, "Life is too short"
I wish you'd fuck somebody
Steal my money
Break my heart
Say you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever loved me
Could I be so lucky?
Let me off the hook
I really wish you would
I wish you'd fuck somebody
I wish you'd fuck somebody
You said, "Let's settle down"
Sounds like a downfall
I gotta get out
Without it being my fault
I wish you'd fuck somebody
Steal my money
Break my heart
Say you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever loved me
Could I be so lucky?
Let me off the hook
I really wish you would
I wish you'd fuck somebody
Steal my money
Break my heart
Say you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever loved me
Could I be so lucky?
Let me off the hook
I really wish you would
I wish you'd fuck somebody
I wish you'd fuck somebody
