Song Name: So Long
I feel it when the sun don't shine
Hold my head
And I clear my mind to save me
I'm gonna save me
I won't hide, no
I won't play small
I stay grounded, I can never fall
You won't shake me
You'll never shake me
And I don't care what people say
I'll do it my way
So long
(So long)
All my fears
I'm ready for the day
If I lose some (so long)
Then I've lost them
What more can I say?
I know there's a darker side
The ones that only feed their pride
They're aching
Oh! They'rе aching
I long for a higher plane
Don't forget my mama gavе me my name
You don't make me
Nah, you don't make me
And when I see that rising sun
I know my time has finally come
So long
(So long)
All my fears
I'm ready for the day
If I lose some (so long)
Then I've lost them
What more can I say?
