Song Name: After Midnight
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere to go
Many years ago
Would you allow?
Could you allow?
That's what they're like
Did you look?
Did you look?
Heavenly, heavenly sort of sounds adolescent
Well, I told you not, not to look from the start?
When the sun is almost gone it's way too much
Enough said
Enough sense
It's unconventional
When the sun is almost gone it's not enough
Suddenly, finally without a yell I'll listen
That's what we're like in broad daylight
Soon you'll realize
It's after midnight
My memories, souvenirs, some originals
High up in the rows
Idolized, canonized
That morning rise
I told you not
I told you not
No veneer behind the mirror
Did you call from a distance?
Well, I told you not, not to look from this side
When the sun is almost gone it's way too much
Enough said
Enough sense
It's unconditional
When the sun is almost gone it's not enough
Suddenly, finally without a yell I'll listen
That's what we're like in broad daylight
Soon you'll realize
It's after midnight
Listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, listen

That's what we're like in broad daylight
Soon you'll realize
It's after midnight
