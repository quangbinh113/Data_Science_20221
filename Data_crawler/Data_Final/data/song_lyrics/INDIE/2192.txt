Song Name: Quicksand
I feel myself take it for granted
I know I should be happy here
Everything that I wished would happen
Is staring back at me crystal clear
That's when the pattern takes control
Playing the game over and over
Letting me know it's never gonna let me go
I know
If I had everything I wanted, would I want more?
Would I keep fighting if there's nothing left to fight for?
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
I used to think that this was something I could die for
I hate admitting to myself that I was never sure
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
One thing I never thought I'd be
Chasing my tail just for the feeling
Lying in bed, stare at the ceiling
And farewell the light the dark is stealing
It's all I know and I'm taking it back, taking it back
It's all I know and I'm taking it back, taking it back
If I had everything I wanted, would I want more?
Would I keep fighting if there's nothing left to fight for?
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
I used to think that this was something I could die for
I hate admitting to myself that I was never sure
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
I'm waiting, anticipating, breath bated
Thinking bout everything I never did
I'm trying, but what's the use in trying
When all I'm left with is disillusionment
It's all I know and I'm taking it back, taking it back
It's all I know and I'm taking it back, taking it back
If I had everything I wanted, would I want more?
Would I keep fighting if there's nothing left to fight for?
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
I used to think that this was something I could die for
I hate admitting to myself that I was never sure
Sometimes I feel like I'm just sinking into quicksand, quicksand
