Song Name: Doubt
Good god, it's a toss up
So sweet but she's a little fucked up
I stopped to think about the future
Seems so clear, never want to lose it
I know, I-I-I know dear
I think that it's copacetic
Told me that I look pathetic
Drinks it up like a kind of fetish now
She'll go on and tell me so
She'll go on and tell me
Her friends, all her friends said
She needs something
Like some time away
They say "tell me all her secrets"
Bested up, up on so dramatic
Should I la-la-la-la-laugh still
I think that you're just excited
Got my heart all opened up, divided
God, I love feeling like an island
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
Never doubt it
(Go on and tell me)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
Go on and tell me so
The way it seems, so quiet now
Subtlety, there's never any need to hide it
I feel this still
We'll never be alone again
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(Go on and tell me)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(Go on and tell me)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
