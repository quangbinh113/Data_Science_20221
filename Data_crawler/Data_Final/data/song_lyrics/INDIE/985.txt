Song Name: Ophelia
Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back
I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness
Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, Heaven help the fool who falls in love
I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (woo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
Honey, I love you
That's all she wrote
Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, Heaven help the fool who falls in love
