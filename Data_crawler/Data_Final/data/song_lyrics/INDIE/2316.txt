Song Name: is your bedroom ceiling bored? (feat. Cavetown)
I stay up late, and I talk to the moon
And I can't stop telling him all about you
Wonder if you do the same thing I do

These four white walls they know more than my friends
They watch me type messages I'll never send
This is the place that I just can't pretend to be alright
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
Of you staring at it all the time?
'Cause it's seen so many nights where I cry
And I yell at the sky for not telling you how I feel
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
I get up early and talk to the sun
And ask her for guidance
But she ain't got none
How am I supposed to know you're not the one
I'm begging to the mirror 'cause I can't find an answer
Too busy falling apart
And I wonder if you're moving on
If you are, what's your secret?
'Cause I can't work out where to start
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
Of you staring at it all the time?
'Cause it's seen so many nights where I cry
And I yell at the sky for not telling you how I feel
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
I stay up late, and I talk to the moon
I can't stop telling him all about you
Wonder if you do the same thing I do
I get up early and talk to the sun
Ask her for guidance, but she ain't got none
Wonder if you do the same thing I do
I hope you do
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
Of you staring at it all the time?
'Cause it's seen so many nights where I cry
And I yell at the sky for not telling you how I feel
Is your bedroom ceiling bored?
Is your bedroom ceiling bored like mine?
