Song Name: Backyard Boy (with Jeremy Zucker)
Five, six, seven, eight
Dance with me in my backyard, boy
Looking super fine in your corduroy
Drive me around the block, we can go in a loop
And we'll turn the volume up on some good boy-band tunes
Love to feel the fresh air
I can feel your eyes stare
And I'm not gonna lie
I get a little bit scared
My heart is on wings
I'm living in dreams
And at the top of our lungs, we sing
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Everything is perfect
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
All our words were worth it
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Dancing around like a clown at the circus
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Backyard boy, you make me nervous
Dancing on my own, I need a vacation
Got my bluff on my friends just to make a statement
But damn, this feels nice with the sun in my eyes
And I swear on my life that I'm not gonna cry
'Til I feel the fresh air
And I feel your eyes stare
And I'm not gonna lie
I get a little bit scared
My heart is on wings
I'm living in dreams
And at the top of our lungs, we sing
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Everything is perfect
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
All our words were worth it
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Dancing around like a clown at the circus
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Backyard boy, you make me nervous
