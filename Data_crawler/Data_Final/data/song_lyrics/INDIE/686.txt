Song Name: VICES
Feel like I'm just passing by
It's not love, it's just a guy
And it's got me feeling right for the night, but
In the morning, when he's gone
I'm alone with all my thoughts
So I gotta drink 'em up 'til I'm numb and
Ooh, it's never enough
Pass me the cup
Got nowhere to run
So pour me another one
I'm taking it all
I'm getting lost
I'm making a fool of myself with all these vices
I really don't know why I'm like this
And I just don't care what the price is
'Cause I need these vices, oh-oh-oh
If it's not drugs, it's drinks
If it's not drinks, it's things
If it's not things, it's people
Places I don't wanna be, these vices
Is it okay I'm not okay?
I don't sleep too much these days
And I hate being awake when the sun's out
Lock my door and shut the blinds
They can't see my bloodshot eyes
I got habits I can't hide in the light and
Ooh, it's never enough
Pass me the cup
Got nowhere to run
So pour me another one
I'm taking it all
I'm getting lost
I'm making a fool of myself with all these vices
I really don't know why I'm like this
And I just don't care what the price is
'Cause I need these vices, oh-oh-oh
If it's not drugs, it's drinks
If it's not drinks, it's things
If it's not things, it's people
Places I don't wanna be, these vices
And I just don't care what the price is
I'm tryna fill up the silence
With all these vices, oh-oh-oh
Burnin' through a cigarette
Got somebody in my bed
But I'm still just in my head, in my head and
All the signs are turning red
And I'm starting to regret, and I'm starting to regret
To regret these vices
I really don't know why I'm like this
And I just don't care what the price is
'Cause I need these vices, oh-oh-oh
If it's not drugs, it's drinks
If it's not drinks, it's things
If it's not things, it's people
Places I don't wanna be, these vices
And I just don't care what the price is
I'm tryna fill up the silence
With all these vices, oh-oh-oh
