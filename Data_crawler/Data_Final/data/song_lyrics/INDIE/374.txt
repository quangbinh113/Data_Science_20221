Song Name: Kalmia Kid
If I found someone to stick like glue to

I'd probably peer out from the leaves
Hide a couple of roses up my sleeve
And I always find myself stuck in this love goo
Feelings are hard to ignore
Especially when you don't know what they're for
Don't know just what makes flowers bloom
But I hope that they'll enjoy a tune
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me-e-e-e-e-e
It's lonely in the forest that I grow in
I wish I could dive into the sea
But I'm stuck inside a hive covered in honey
I never really know which way I'm goin'
But I guess the weather's warm enough to bear
And I never have to brush or do my hair
Don't know just what makes flowers bloom
But I hope that they'll enjoy a tune
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me-e-e-e-e-e
It's lonely in the coral reef I float in
I wish I could swim out of the sea
But sharks are circling and nothin's easy
I-I still don't really know which way I'm goin'
But I guess the water's warm enough to bear
And I never have to wash or dry my hair
I miss watching the flowers bloom
But at least I can keep writing tunes
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
That's fine with me
That's fine with me-e-e-e-e-e
