Song Name: Go Away
You can take the throne
Body glows like gold
Beatin' hearts like clothes
Without you, time moves slow
Do you think that I could stay?
'Cause if I leave then I don't play
I know this feeling's not a crime (crime)
You said you feel it all the time
But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
If you saw me every mornin'
Would you feel less important?
Is that too much or forcin'?
'Cause I don't wanna be much
I love the way that we touch
Do you like all of my friends?
Yeah, I want your attention
Before you never mentioned
That you got time here to stay
Is that too much for your brain?
But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
