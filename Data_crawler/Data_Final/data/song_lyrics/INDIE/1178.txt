Song Name: Fallen
Tell me things you've never said out loud
Just try and go there if you can

Show me the parts of you you're not that proud of

I want to know, I'm just a man
I'll have you know that I have good and bad days
Come on now love, don't be naive
Lay out our cards and you'll see all my mistakes
Well, I don't mind while you're with me

When have I fallen?
Am I crawling on my knees?
Here I'm calling
In the hope that you'll see me
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
This voice inside of me has lost its breath
It's far too tired to sing at ease
All of the things I never said out loud
They will remain inside of me
Yeah, and I'm falling
Yes, I'm crawling on my knees
Yeah, and I'm calling
Out in search of who we'll be
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Tell me things you've never said out loud
'Cause I want to know, I'm just a man
