Song Name: Beggin (original version)
Ooh
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin'
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
Would easy come, and easy go, and it would end?
So, why any time I leave, you let me go?
Any time I reach, you get me low
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I planted a seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm (beggin')
'Cause I don't wanna lose (you)
I got my arms outspread, I hope that my heart gets fed
Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' (beggin')
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I need you (yeah) to understand (woah)
Tried so hard (ayy) to be your man
The kind of man (ho) you want in the end (woah)
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell, I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man, that I don't know
Won't even stand, the devil's chance to win my soul
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're on the wrong way track from the good
I only painted a picture, tellin' where we could be at
Like the heart ain't attached where it should
You done gave it the away, ya had it 'til ya took it back
But I keep walkin' on, keep open doors
Keep hopin' for, that the court is yours
Keep hoes on hold, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm fightin' hard (yeah) to hold my own (hold my own), woah
Just can't make it all alone (all alone)
I'm holdin' on (yuh), can't fall back (now I'm fallin'), woah
I'm just a con, 'bout to fade to black
And I can't come home, you call (beggin')
And I can't come home, you call
Can't come home, you call (beggin')
And I can't come home, you call (can't come home, you call...)
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
