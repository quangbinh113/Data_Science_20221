Song Name: Why Can't I?
Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walkin' down the street and I hardly know you (hardly know you)
It's just like we were meant to be
Holding hands with you, we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right (isn't right)
And I've got someone waiting too
What if this is just the beginning?
We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
(Whenever I think about you, whenever I think about you)

Isn't this the best part of breakin' up
Finding someone else you can't get enough of?
Someone who wants to be with you too
It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch
But wouldn't it be beautiful?
Here we go, we're at the beginning
We haven't fucked yet but my head's spinning
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
I'd love for you to make me wonder
Where it's goin'
I'd love for you to pull me under
Somethin's growin'
Out of this that we can control
Baby I am dyin'
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
(Whenever I think about you, Whenever I think about you)
