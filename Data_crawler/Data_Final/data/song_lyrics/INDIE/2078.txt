Song Name: Tal Uno
Your band's doing better than my band
I'll go to your show but I'm not gonna dance
You broke your wrist and got a cast on your hand
Covered in peace signs
Your sister cut your hair and she gave you bangs
What'd she do that for
You're semi-precious and kind of reckless
I think you're better on your own
I got your message, I left my necklace
I got your picture on my phone
Don't you think that you can do better
Don't you think that you can do better
Your car won't start, you need a ride
You work at eight called me at nine
But I don't have your number in my phone anymore
I saw you walking on the side of the road alone
You're semi-precious and kind of reckless
I think you're better on your own
I got your message, I left my necklace
I got your picture on my phone
Don't you think that you can do better
Don't you think that you can do better
I'm giving you up, I'm giving you over
I'm giving you up, I'm giving you over
You're semi-precious and kind of reckless
I think you're better on your own
I got your message, I left my necklace
I got your picture on my phone
Don't you think that you can do better
Don't you think that you can do better
