Song Name: Boys That Dance
Man's on an east ting
Yellow black diamonds like a bee sting
Sad boy tats and a nose ring
He runnin' them lines like he acting
That white on the white, he distracting
He love when I say "I don't wanna play none now"
He know that I'm on one now, hey
Pull up, pull up when you need me
You saying my name you go freaky
Yeah, we cannot name this kind of love
You're turning it on like the light above, yeah
Killin' a vibe, they so vicious
Runnin' they mouth ain't they business
Givin' it away, on ambitious
The way you be lookin', delicious
I've been saying
"This ain't the time for romance"
I've been searching
Waiting for them boys that dance
Oh, oh, oh
Whatcha gon', whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do? Yeah
Whatcha gon' whatcha gon' do? Yeah, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Whatcha gon', whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do? Yeah
Whatcha gon' whatcha gon' do? Yeah, oh, oh
Man's on a bad ting
Wanna roll it up, cop a bag ting
All flex, he just wanna brag ting
Snatchin' they wigs, now they gaggin'
Pink album drop, it still bangin'
You hate when I say "I don't wanna play none now"
You know that I'm on one now, hey
Pull up, pull up, gwan' big up yourself
Sayin my name, don't need nobody else
We cannot name this kind of feelin'
Turnin' it on, goin' straight to the ceiling
Killin' a vibe, they so vicious
Runnin' they mouth ain't they business
Give it away, ambitious
The way you be lookin', delicious
I've been saying
"This ain't the time for romance"
I've been searching
Waiting for them boys that dance
Oh, oh, oh
Whatcha gon', whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do? Yeah
Whatcha gon' whatcha gon' do? Yeah, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Whatcha gon', whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do? Yeah

"This ain't the time for romance"
I've been searching
Waiting for them boys that dance
