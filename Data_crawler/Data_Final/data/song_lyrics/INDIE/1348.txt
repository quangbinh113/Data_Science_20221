Song Name: Molly
Turn the lights off, put the music on
Let's pop this pill under the disco ball
Tonight I want to dance with you
And get all the way down
I've been waiting so long
To get to know your body
Now it's kicking in
And I'm singing
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling
In love with you?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling
In love with you?
(Uuuh)
Come a little bit, little bit, little bit closer
Gonna need your touch
You're a little bit, little bit, little bit further
Than I can handle
We can't go to the dance hall
That doesn't stop us, no
Want you to grind on me right now
In my living room
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling
In love with you?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling?
Is it the molly, or am I really falling
In love with you?
(You, you, you, you)
I don't know if you mean to
But you are killing me
There's nothing like your body
Against my bare skin
(You, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you)
