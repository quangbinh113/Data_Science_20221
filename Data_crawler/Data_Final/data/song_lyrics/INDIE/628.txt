Song Name: Liar (with OST)
All the lies, lies, lies that you told
Now the world knows
That you're just a monster
It shows, shows, your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
All the lies, lies, lies that you told
Now the world knows
That you're just a monster
It shows, shows, your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
All the things you said you would do
All the lies, lies, I see through
Now the world knows your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
(See it clearly-)
I see it clearly you're a liar
I see it clearly you're a liar
All the lies, lies, lies that you told
Now the world knows
That you're just a monster
It shows, shows, your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
All the things you said you would do
All the lies, lies, I see through
Now the world knows your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
(Your true colors)
(You're a liar)
Said you were a friend
Never would have known
Fuck with me and learn the hard way
All the lies you've lost your god damn way (Way-ay-ay-ay)
(Way-ay-ay-ay, look at the mess you made)
(That's just the price you pay)
All the lies, lies, lies that you told
Now the world knows
That you're just a monster
It shows, shows, your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
All the things you said you would do
All the lies, lies, I see through
Now the world knows your true colors
I see it clearly you're a liar
(See it clearly)
I see it clearly you're a liar
I see it clearly you're a liar
(Look at the mess you made)
(That's just the price you pay)
(Look at the mess you made)
(I see it clearly you're a liar)
(Your true colors)
(You're a liar)
We will stand up
We see through you
Fuck the lies you spread
Sit down your times up
We will stand up
We see through you
Fuck the lies you spread
Sit down your times up
