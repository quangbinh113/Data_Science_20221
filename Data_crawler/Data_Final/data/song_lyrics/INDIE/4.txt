Song Name: Ready To Let Go
Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On both sides the vow was broken
Oh my my, I'm the one
Trying to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken
As we slow dance, I became your statue, frozen
'Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes
Still withholding everything
Like we were never close
Don't you worry baby
No sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself
I'ma spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go
Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground, our vows were broken
We met up, we broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red, ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming
As we slow dance, I became your statue, frozen
'Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close
Don't you worry baby
No sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself
I'ma spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go
Don't you worry baby
No sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself
I'ma spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go
