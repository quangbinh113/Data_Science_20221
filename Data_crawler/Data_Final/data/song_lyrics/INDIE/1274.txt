Song Name: Help I'm Alive
I tremble
(I tremble, I tremble)
(I tremble, I tremble)
(I tremble, I tremble)
They're gonna eat me alive
(Gonna eat me alive, gonna eat me alive)
(Gonna eat me alive)
If I stumble
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
They're gonna eat me alive
(Gonna eat me alive, gonna eat me alive)
(Gonna eat me alive)
Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?
Beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse
The pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps...
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
If we're still alive
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart's still...
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse
The pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps...
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
If we're still alive
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart's still...
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer (beating like a hammer)
Beating like a hammer (beating like a hammer)
Beating like a hammer (beating like a hammer)
I tremble
(I tremble, I tremble)
(I tremble, I tremble)
(I tremble, I tremble)
They're gonna eat me alive
(Alive, alive, alive, alive)
(Alive, alive)
If I stumble
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
(If I stumble, if I stumble)
They're gonna eat me alive
(Alive, alive, alive, alive)
(Alive, alive)
Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Help, I'm alive
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
