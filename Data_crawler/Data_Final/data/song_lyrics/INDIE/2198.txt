Song Name: Stay And Rest For A While
Lonely road
So long to go
Still so far away
Falling eyes
Spill into the night
There's no simple place
Stay and rest for a while
Leave behind the weight
Let the strain all wash away
It's not easy
Watch the world go by
Settle down and spend some time
Just believe me
Stay and rest for a while
Lay your head tonight
Stay and rest for a while
If you want 'til you find your feet
Take a place in the sun
Everybody needs some sweet relief
So stay and rest for a while
