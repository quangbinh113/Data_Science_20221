Song Name: ...baby one more time
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me
(And I) I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh baby, baby, there's nothing that I shouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me
(And I) I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
