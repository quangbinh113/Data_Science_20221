Song Name: Where Do We Go From Here?
Where do we go from here?
When the floor's not near my feet
Pulled up from underneath
Knocked the wind right out of me
Looking like a fool
'Cause I trusted you
Had me doing things
I swore this time I would never do
Let me know what you want
'Cause you don't touch my body
You're looking at everyone
But never lookin' at me
I gave you all my love
How am I not enough?
Let me know what you need
'Cause I know that this could be
Better than any dream
If you would only let me
Give you all my love
Or am I not enough?
Know it's not right
But I'm up all night, fits of jealousy
Wish I could forget
What I found in your history
Looking like a fool (like a fool)
'Cause I trusted you (trusted you)
Had me doing things
I swore this time I would never do
Let me know what you want
'Cause you don't touch my body
You're looking at everyone
But never looking at me
I gave you all my love
How am I not enough?
Let me know what you need
'Cause I know that this could be
Better than any dream
If you would only let me
Give you all my love
Or am I not enough?
And every time, every time (I, I, I, I)
Think, I think it, I think it's fine, think it's fine (I, I, I, I)
And every time, every time
I think it's fine, think it's fine
To let you in and trust again
You go ahead and change my mind
Let me know what you want
'Cause you don't touch my body
You're looking at everyone (everyone)
But never looking at me
I gave you all my love (all my love)
How am I not enough?
Let me know what you need (what you need)
'Cause I know that this could be
Better than any dream (any dream)
If you would only let me
Give you all my love
Or am I not enough?
(Let me know what you want)
How am I not enough?
(Looking at everyone)
Gave you all my love
(Gave you all my love)
But I'm just not enough
