Song Name: Shy
Don't be shy, look alive
No eyes above could see enough to be surprised
Blue the sky and miles wide
It weighs a ton, cracked by the sun
Oh, what a lie our strings have spun
And it's too hard to find
An empty space for two to hide
Girl, wanna take your hand
I wanna show you the world
Rebel, red curls
Do I surrender weeks to young hearts running free?
Well, don't be shy, look alive
Lamented love works hand in glove with wandering eyes
Well, I can't take you on the plane
And I can't call you home again
And it's well after dark
The night was doomed from the start
And maybe it's not hard to find
The empty space for two to hide
Girl, wanna take your hand
I wanna show you the world
Rebel, red curls
Do I surrender weeks to young hearts running free?
In dreams
I stay to see both dirty and clean
Only in dreams
Is there a place for me
(Ow)
Girl, wanna take your hand
I wanna show you the world
Rebel, red curls
Do I surrender weeks to young hearts running free?
