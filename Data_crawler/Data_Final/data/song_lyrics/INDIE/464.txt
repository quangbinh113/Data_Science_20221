Song Name: Monster
Tell me again
About how it hurts
Being awfully loud
For an introvert
Get out of my room
Smile wiped clean
Isn't it weird
To be so mean?
I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
I craft my words to fit your head
'Cause no one listens to the dead
So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
Please, let the devil in
A meter apart
You blankly stare
We shout in our heads
Are you still in there?
Well this ends bad, then
We knew it would
So we won't eat our words
'Cause they don't taste good
I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
A thousand words are left unsaid
'Cause no one listens to the dead
So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
Oh-oh, I think it might be worth a try
Oh-oh-oh, am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
Please, let the devil in
We won't eat our words
They don't taste so good
We won't eat our words
They don't taste so good
Look, I know that I've seen this before
High and mighty, at the top of your list
Adoring every move, now my rank is sinking
But we're both guilty of black or white thinking
And through my red eyes, you look pale
All of your scars now looking more like scales
Two ugly creatures, two sinister preachers
Blind to the past, like a couple of monsters
Just a couple of monsters
So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, you've said your speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
Oh-oh, I think it might be worth a try
Oh-oh-oh, am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
Please, let the devil in
We won't eat our words
They don't taste so good
We won't eat our words
They don't taste so good
