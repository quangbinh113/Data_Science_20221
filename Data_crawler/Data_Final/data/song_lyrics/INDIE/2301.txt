Song Name: Genius Of Love
I'm gonna have some fun
(What do you consider fun?)
Fun, natural fun
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning, and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
He'll take my arm
When we're walking, rolling and rocking
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
I'm in heaven
With the maven of funk mutation
'S musicians such as
Raise expectations to a new intention
No one can sing
Quite like Smokey
Wailin' and skankin' to Bob Marley
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robbie
Oopsy mama say the
Oopsy mama say the
Oopsy mama say the
Oopsy mama
All the weekend
Boyfriend was missing
I surely miss him
The way he'd hold me in his warm arms
We went insane when we took cocaine
Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon
Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon
Stepping in-a rhythm to-a
Who needs to think when your feet just go?
With a hiditihi, with a hipitiho
Who needs to think when your feet just go?
Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon
Who needs to think when your feet just go?
Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon
If you see him
Please remind him, unhappy boyfriend
Well, he's the genius of love
He's got a greater depth of feeling
Well, he's the genius of love
He's so deep
