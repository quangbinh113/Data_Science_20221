Song Name: Canary Islands
You know that I've gotta go now
Wanna fly away from this place
You know that this is the way to my heart
We'll sail the South Canary
We can go all the way to space
You know that this is the way to my heart
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
You know that I've had this feeling
Weather's changing and it's getting too cold
You know that this is the way to my heart
We'll sleep on a sailboat
And cry until we get real old
You know that this is the way to my heart
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
I'm waiting for you, you
