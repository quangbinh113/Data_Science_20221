Song Name: Radio
I don't need too much
Just a stereo
And some rock and roll on a real guitar
Now I get so bored
It's so monotonous
Remember when we thought
It was all gonna be so grand?
Well, don't you understand?
On the radio, you just listen to music
You don't need some video
Just gotta get yourself home
And all the world keeps spinning forever on
Out of my control
So, what's coming on soon?
It's surely nothing new
'Cause I've heard this song so many times
But I kinda like it
It's this or the silence
There's no deciding every line
But maybe it'll play next time
On the radio, just listen to music
You don't need some video
Just gotta get yourself home
And all the world keeps spinning forever on
Out of my control
So, I turn down the music
And stop the car
I started talking to myself
About who we are
I mean we're all just people
People in motion
And we're always moving
But seems we're never going
'Cause there's just too much now out there
And I get so frozen
It seems to me there was a time before the box was open
And I could just relax
'Cause everything was all we had
On the radio, wait, just listen to music
You don't need some video
Just gotta get yourself home, mmm
And all the world keeps spinning forever on
Out of my control, it's out of my control
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
