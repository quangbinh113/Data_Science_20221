Song Name: Rock & Roll - Full Length Version; 2015 Remaster
Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then, one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
They know, she don't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Despite all the imputations
You know, you could just go out
And dance to a rock'n'roll station
And it was all right, hey baby (it was alright)
You know, it was all right (it was alright)
Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
"You know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all"
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all
No, just your time do
Then, one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yeah, rock'n'roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to that rock'n'roll station
And baby, it was all right, yeah (it was alright)
Hey, it was all right (it was alright)
Hey, here she comes now
That Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
"Hey, you know, there's nothin' happening at all, not at all"
Every time I put on the radio
You know, there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
But, one fine morning, she hears a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yes, rock'n'roll, ooh
Despite all the computations
You know, you could just dance to the rock'n'roll station
All right
All right, and it was all right
Hey, listen to me now, and it was all right
Come on now, believe me, it was all right
It was all right
Hey, it was alright (alright)
It's alright (alright)
Hey, it's all right now (alright)
Hey, it's alright now (alright)
It's alright now (alright)
It's alright (alright)
Hey, it's alright now (alright)
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby (alright, alright, alright)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (alright)
It's alright now (alright)
Ooh, it's alright now (alright)
Oh, oh, alright now (alright, alright)
