Song Name: Into
There's a feeling you can't shake
Was it worth it would you say
Didn't think that it was safe
Underneath your name
In the same
Disguise
Stay underneath it
This time
You feel
Alright
You're turning into
The lie
There's a secret you can't hide
It doesn't matter what you try
Didn't think that it was right
Darkness in your eyes
In the same
Disguise
Stay underneath it
This time
You feel
Alright
You're turning into
The lie
