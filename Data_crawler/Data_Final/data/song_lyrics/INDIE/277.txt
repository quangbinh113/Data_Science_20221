Song Name: Wanted
You would take me, you would have me
Dead or alive, every single night
I could let you, I would let you
But is it a crime to play with your mind?
Don't get too upset with me
You're the one obsessed with me
Whoa, whoa, I surrender now
Oh-oh, chasing after me like I'm wanted
Oh-oh, call the cops, it makes me feel wanted
You turning me in and I don't blame you
'Cause every time you're gone I wanted to
Oh-oh, you mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Oh-oh, you mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Oh-oh, you mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Why do I feel like you're watching me? Oh
When you're not around you're still here somehow
Red and blue lights light up the sky
I'm not even scared, love me if you dare
Don't get too upset with me
You're the one obsessed with me
Whoa, whoa, I surrender now
Oh-oh, chasing after me like I'm wanted
Oh-oh, call the cops, it makes me feel wanted
You turning me in and I don't blame you
'Cause every time you're gone I wanted to
Oh-oh, you mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Oh-oh, just like you wanted
Oh-oh, you mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Just like you wanted, just like you wanted
Just like I'm wanted, just like you wanted
You mess me up, yeah, just like you wanted
Just like you wanted
