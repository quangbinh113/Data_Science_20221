Song Name: Mess It Up
Opened two double doors
Typical, pretty sure I could grow up
Probably chemical
I took up walking to turn it all off
Doesn't feel bearable
Guess I thought when I left it would all stop
Hmm, it would all stop
Did I fall out of line when I called you?
When I told you "I'm fine", you were lied to
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough?
'Cause every time I get too close, I just go mess it up
Funny that (funny that) didn't work (didn't work)
I could be anywhere, I'm on your block
Cynical (cynical), terrible (terrible)
Kicking myself with my gut in a knot
'Cause I heard that you're (heard that you're) happier (happier)
Hope that you're sleeping well knowing I'm not
I'm doing too much, hmm
Did I fall (did I fall) out of line (out of line) when I called you?
When I told (when I told) you "I'm fine" (you "I'm fine")
You were lied to (I told you I'm lying)
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough?
'Cause every time I get too close, I just go mess it up
I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We can make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together, you could watch it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We can make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together, you could watch it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We can make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together, you could watch it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We can make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together, you could watch it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
