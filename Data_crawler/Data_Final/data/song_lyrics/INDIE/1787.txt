Song Name: Time Bomb
Found my corner of the matrix
No, I never thought I'd say this
But it turns out all my friends are famous
So concerned with reputation
Why, every night, do I try assimilating?
Not gonna lie, I'm getting tired of this simulation
I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
Don't care about your homies pretending that they know me
I don't got time for phonies or validation
Get fucked up every Thursday, drink like it's your birthday
So obsessed with first place, uh-uh
Yea, I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
I guess I'll stay on this vibration
I don't need your reciprocation
'Cause it turns out, love is condensation
I keep it moving on 'cause I'm impatient
Why, every night, do I try assimilating?
Not gonna lie, gettin' tired of this simulation
I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
Don't care about your homies pretending that they know me
I don't got time for phonies or validation
Get fucked up every Thursday, drink like its your birthday
So obsessed with first place
Yea, I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
Don't care about your homies pretending that they know me
I don't got time for phonies or validation
Get fucked up every Thursday, drink like its your birthday
So obsessed with first place
Yea, I'm a tickin' time bomb looking for my ride home
Flickin' through my iPhone, no destination
