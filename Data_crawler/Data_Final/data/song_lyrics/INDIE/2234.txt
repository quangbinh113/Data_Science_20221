Song Name: In Manchester
Some of the men that spawned fibre optic prawns
Barely concealed a grand canyonic yawn
Passed a nationalist getting buried
In Manchester
In Manchester
Tricolour flying, sun shining, large crowd around
A freshly dug grave, priest arms blesses, the flag is waving
Stern indian serves original flavourings
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah-ha
I don't yet know where my story will end
Dead or in prison or completely around the bend
So punch was essential, dust heads exploded
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah-ha
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah-ha
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah-ha
