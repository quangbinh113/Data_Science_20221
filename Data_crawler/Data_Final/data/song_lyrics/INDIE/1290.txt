Song Name: I Don't Know
Benny gets it from his mother
No one knows the time
Je ne sais pas
Only come around in winter
Cold enough to stay together
Je ne sais pas
Oh there's a breeze
Hardly can breathe
How can you meet anyone anew?
Out in the world
Out of control
I'mma take the only road I know
It's the late afternoon
And there's family now
I don't wanna be inside
Inside out
I go on in a daze
I got nowhere to stay
Another petal falls down
It's the late afternoon
And there's family now
I don't wanna be inside
Inside out
I go on in a daze
I got nowhere to stay
Another petal falls down
Daddy got a car with leather
But it might break down
Je ne sais pas
What you know
You like that better
Different strokes
It doesn't matter
Jene sais pas
Oh there's a breeze
Hardly can breathe
How can you meet anyone anew?
Out in the world
Out of control
I'mma take the only road I know
It's the late afternoon
And there's family now
I don't wanna be inside
Inside out
I go on in a daze
I got nowhere to stay
Another petal falls down
It's the late afternoon
And there's family now
I don't wanna be inside
Inside out
I go on in a daze
I got nowhere to stay
Another petal falls down
