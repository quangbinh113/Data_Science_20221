Song Name: stuck on us
Sitting in the front seat of your car
Driving way too fast, got your foot on the floor
Oh, my God
Oh, my God
Got your music up and my hand's in yours
Take the long way home, 'cause you know I want more
Of your love
Of your love
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate this stuff
(I hate this stuff, I hate this stuff)
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate your love (I hate your love)
God, I hate your love (I hate your love)
Sitting in the front, got my hand on the wheel
And I'm falling for the little things that you make me feel
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
Middle of the night 'bout 3:02
Catch your eyes in the corner of my rearview
Fall in love (fall in love)
Fall in love...
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate this stuff
(I hate this stuff, I hate this stuff)
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate your love
(I hate your love, I hate your love)
(I hate this stuff, I hate this stuff)
(I hate your love, I hate your love)
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate this stuff
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
That I'm stuck on us
God, I hate your love
