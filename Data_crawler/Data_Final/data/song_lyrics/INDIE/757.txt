Song Name: Lowlife
Oh, suitcase
Clean getaway
I'm the one who takes the blame again
New day but the
Same lines, I
Feel like the victim of a dollar sign
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
Til you came, don't you know?
Don't you know?
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
This bad taste
These headaches
Wake up on the floor again, ah yea
My torn dress
This failed test
Soon they will be erased
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
Til you came, don't you know?
Don't you know?
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
And I get so lonely
I can't make it on my own
And I need to call you
Can you come to my cheatau?
Take me in your arms and
Hold me tight, yeah, pull me close
Whisper in my ear
All I want you to say is
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
