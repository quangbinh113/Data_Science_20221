Song Name: lavender blood
Nervous demeanor
Please make things cleaner
Fill me with dirt
Whatever makes you worse
Lavender is always running through my blood
I've had enough, I'm cold and it is dusk
Turn into dust, it's dripping from my gums
It's not enough
Stay neat and healthy
You need to help me
Learned how to carry myself
Place something on the top shelf
Save it for later
Lavender is always running through my blood
I've had enough, I'm cold and it is dusk
Turn into dust, it's dripping from my gums
It's not enough
