Song Name: Back Into Your Arms
Don't go changing everything you know
Some things take some time before they grow
And all the thoughts that bring you down
Won't always be there with you now
And I've been making changes every day
To show you that I am not just what they say
And I won't try to understand
The way you feel inside your head
This time
Until I'm back into your arms
Until I'm back into your arms
You know I'd never do you wrong
Until I'm back into your arms
Don't go changing everything you know
I'm done losing every time you go
From all the ways you make me feel
To the lengths you go to not be near
Seasons change and everything's the same
And I don't know if there's an easy way
Still driving down old avenues
Still seeing all those things in you
It's hard
Until I'm back into your arms
Until I'm back into your arms
You know I'd never do you wrong
Until I'm back into your arms
Give me a reason
Give me a reason to leave
Fall into pieces
Fall through the cracks in your sleep
A love that's indecent
Love you completely madly
Don't need a reason
Don't need a reason from me
Don't need a reason from me
Don't need a reason from me
Don't need a reason from me
Don't need a reason from me
