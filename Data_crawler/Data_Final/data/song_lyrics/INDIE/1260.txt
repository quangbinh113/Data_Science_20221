Song Name: Sea of Love
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Do you remember when we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
