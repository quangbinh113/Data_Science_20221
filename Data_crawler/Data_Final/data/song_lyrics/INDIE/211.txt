Song Name: The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home - Single Version
I don't know what I want, if I'm completely honest
I guess I could start a war, I guess I could sleep on it
I don't know what I want, if I'm completely honest
I guess I could start a war, I guess I could sleep on it
But hey there kids with guns
Your neighbours complain
But they don't know where they come from
I guess it's just bad advice for someone so upstanding
So maybe just ask them twice or be a bit demanding
You don't know how to give love to anyone
You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again

No the kids don't wanna come home again
Haven't you any shame? Have you got no morals?
Teaching them how to aim no sadness and no sorrow
Well hey there mother mine
Your kids are sick but they're gonna be just fine
I said possibly not if you keep raising them this way
You're just leading them to die, oh your disbelief and dismay
But hey there kids with guns
Your neighbours complain
But they don't know where they come from
You don't know how to give love to anyone

You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again
No the kids don't wanna come home again
You don't know how to give love to anyone
You don't know how to pretend
You told your kids that they'd live long forever
But the kids don't wanna come home again
No the kids don't wanna come home again
No the kids don't wanna come home again
No the kids don't wanna come home
