Song Name: God Must Be Doing Cocaine
All of the zombies walking 'round LA
Making the city our stage
Gives us our pleasure and cuts it with pain
God must be doing cocaine
Everyone's changin' their body and face
Don't like the way we were made
So many prayers out as He stay awake
God must be doing cocaine
Can anyone really blame Him?
He probably needs an escape
Looking down at His creation
And thinking we've thrown it away
Robots are learning and we can't keep pace
Feels like we'll all be replaced
Gets wild ideas when He stays up late
God must be doing cocaine
Can anyone really blame Him?
He probably needs an escape
Looking down at His creation
And thinking we've thrown it away
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I drove my brothers to school yesterday
Who's gonna make sure they're safe?
Feels like sometimes He goes missing for days
God must be doing cocaine
