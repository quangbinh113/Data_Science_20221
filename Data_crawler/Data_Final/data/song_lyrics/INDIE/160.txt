Song Name: Fancy Shoes
There's whiskey inside my veins
I'm feeling heavy
And I can't explain how I feel for you
You got me dizzy and feeling blue
Let's go walking in the city tonight
You wear the dress that makes you look so nice
Like my fancy shoes
I wore them just for you
Tell me why all the good ones go
Well, I don't know
But I want it to somehow change
I'll be a better man if you just stay
But I'm a prisoner inside these walls
My bed is colder and I'm feeling small
If you're not sleeping with me
Then I'll get no sleep at all
Tell me why all the good ones go
But I don't know
But I want it to somehow change
I'll be a better man if you just stay
