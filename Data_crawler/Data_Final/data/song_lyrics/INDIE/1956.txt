Song Name: All Is Well
Let down all your luck
As it comes and goes away
And rest your patience cause
It's a long road to pace yourself until you
Held up watching, come rescue my hide
Help me slowly but don't bring no sign of hurtin' out
Cause I don't wanna hear about how I've changed
How I've changed
If I get overwhelmed
I'm sure you'll never know
Keep it to myself
All is well
Or else I'm burdensome
The weight that I won't let you hold
Let you hold
And I wanna lose it
Wanna choose what I forget
Be clueless
Unaware of I what I do not have
Only the worst of my nights
It bleeds into my head
Darlin' it's nothin you right
Take it out of my breath
If I get overwhelmed
I'm sure you'll never know
Keep it to myself
All is well
Or else I'm burdensome
The weight that I won't let you hold
Let you hold
Let you hold
