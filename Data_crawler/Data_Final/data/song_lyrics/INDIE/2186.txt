Song Name: 80's High School
Oh
It's so
Down low
Oh
I
Cannot
Let go
No
You're looking at your phone again
I'm unsure where we are
I've got your textbook in the car
I know this in my heart
I'm thinking kinda wrong again
I don't want to restart
This ibuprofen in my vein
Is pushing me too far
Oh
It's so
Down low
Oh
I
Cannot
Let go
No
We're coming to the end
So go tell all your friends
We're heading to LA
We'll be there any day
And don't you get it wrong
I've known it all along
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'm leaving after school
Think it out you'll be fine
Take a minute to rewind
All the noise in your mind
80s high school all the time
Having fun next to you
Never knowing what to do
Dreaming of things to come
Will I be your number one
Oh
It's so down low
Oh
I Cannot Let go
No
