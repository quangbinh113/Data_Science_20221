Song Name: I See You Sometimes
Concrete streets I stroll
My trainers drag, head hanging low
Clothes hang off limbs, body wearing thin
Fire burnin', thick smoke is wadin' in
Can't even breathe, places that I'm in
Expensive lies out them Veuve sips
Going through ego flares and trips (trips)
That's when you gotta disappear and dip
Hide under hills, don't remember the last time
Probably on a mad one, under pills
Time standing still, I see bodies dance
Body trance, tryna be the man still
(I'm driving 'round and gettin' fucked up)
Tryna be the man still
Man still, tryna be the man still (still)
(Yeah, I got my gun in the car)
Tryna be the man still, hey
(I'll keep that in mind)
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
And I don't know where I'm going to
I wouldn't have it any other way
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
And I don't know where I'm going to
I wouldn't have it any other way
(He brings us for the vibe)
High on the blue tones
On the sofa, my shirt and my shoes on
Try and find something I can prove wrong
American spirit and Moon rocks
Naked bodies on futons
Scent of fire in the air
And I stroll through bliss, feel so unaware
Fireworks painting the air, so crazy
Just blew through another year
Same hoodie hidin' my face (my face)
Revenge same old better taste (taste)
The same bitter look on your face (your face)
It don't change (wait)
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
(This is sad, man)
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
(And I wake up, and you know what?)
(I'm the president of the world)
Trust, yeah
