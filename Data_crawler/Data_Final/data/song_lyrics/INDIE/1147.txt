Song Name: 17
I would need a million words
If I tried to define
All the things you mean to me
For you, I'd die a thousand lives
Special kind of energy
'Cause love is born when hearts collide
Every time you touch me
You remind that I'm still alive
So promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're 92
The same as 17
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're 92
The same as 17
I don't really know what's right
But I could never call you wrong
I just wanna dance with you
Floating over marble floors
You're something like an angel
You do something to my mind
I could see a thousand years
When I'm looking in your eyes
Promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're 92
The same as 17
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're 92
The same as 17
Just promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're 92
The same as 17
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're 92
The same as 17
