Song Name: Kill Somebody
Today you made me feel irrelevant
Twisted my intelligence
Made it seem there's no brain in my head
I'm like a skeleton, can't shut my eyes
Right now I feel like I'm an alien
I'm so fucking dangerous
Cover up the evidence with medicine
I can't find the life
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
Today you turned me a cork screw
Filed me like law suit
Put words in my mouth that I don't want you to
And I lost my clout
And my time is acting as my currency
You can't take that away from me
Cheat the young with no accountability
Shoot me down
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
Right, right now I feel like an alien
Like I'm sitting in a state of perpetual frustration
Go on, shove me again, fuck with the head, leave me for dead
Please?
And yet you may think, you may think this is a metaphor
Something you've never heard before
I know I've found on the floor and
Then subconsciously pinned to the door
But then you motherfuckers could cross 'em
Out and I still won't believe what you thought
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody, kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
Oh!
