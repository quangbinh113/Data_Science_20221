Song Name: Everything Stays (feat. Olivia Olson)
Let's go in the garden
You'll find something waiting
Right there where you left it lying upside down
When you finally find it, you'll see how it's faded
The underside is lighter when you turn it around
Everything stays right where you left it
Everything stays
But it still changes
Ever so slightly, daily and nightly
In little ways, when everything stays
Go down to the ocean
The crystal tide is raising
Waters' gotten higher as the shore washes out
Keep your eyes wide open, even when the sun is blazin'
The moon controls the tide, it could cause you to drown
Everything stays, right where you left it
Everything stays, but it still changes
Ever so slightly, daily and nightly
In little ways
When everything stays
