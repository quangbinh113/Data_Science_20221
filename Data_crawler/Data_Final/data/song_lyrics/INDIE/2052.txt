Song Name: Feel It All Around
You feel it all around yourself
You know it's yours and no one else
You feel the thought of love again
It's all right
In spite of all the things you did
We'll work it out
You feel it all around yourself
You know it's yours and no one else
You feel the thought of love again
It's all right
In spite of all the things you did
We'll work it out
