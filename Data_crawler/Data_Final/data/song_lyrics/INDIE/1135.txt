Song Name: If the World Was Ending (feat. Julia Michaels)
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin' watchin' television
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out
I know, you know, we know, you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know, we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Right?
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', that night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
And I know, you know, we know, you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know, we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
I know, you know, we know, you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know, we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Hmm
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
