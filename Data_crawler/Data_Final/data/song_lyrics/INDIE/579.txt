Song Name: July
If I did it could you be the only one who understood?

If I say sorry would you tell me I did everything I could?
I don't know why I'm fighting
But you're stronger than I am tonight
Can't say goodbye
You're prettier than anything I've seen in my whole life
In late July, in late July
I was so happy I could cry
I can't remember why
In late July you said, "Goodbye"
I was so happy I could cry
So happy I could cry
Evil secret you're the precious thing I hide behind my tongue
I'd be foolish if I trusted you with everything you've done
Call me up, listen as I dissolve
I'll pretend to understand at all
In late July, in late July
I was so happy I could cry
I can't remember why
In late July you said, "Goodbye"
I was so happy I could cry
So happy I could cry
