Song Name: Sarcasm
And it is from this world of darkness
From which come the evil, destructive forces of man's nature
You've got me shaking from the way you're talking
My heart is breaking but there's no use crying
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die
Sticks and stones could break my bones
But anything you say will only fuel my lungs
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If that is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
If you could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil, you could be the sinner
If you could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my ears
If you could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil, you could be the sinner
If you could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my, musix to my ears
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If that is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
Before an audience

Failure find me
To tie me up now
'Cause I'm as bad, as bad as it gets
Failure find me
To hang me up now
By my neck 'cause I'm a fate worse than death
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If that is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If that is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
