Song Name: Cross My Heart I Hope U Die
A room of sweet perfume
I know that isn't mine
She left so soon
I passed her on my way
Fifth avenue
Her eyes were full of you
Save me your excuse
Before it leaves your lips
You've tied the noose
And then you let it slip
From under you
I hope that hell feels good

Me and my girls, yeah, call us a coven
When it comes lovin'
They got my back when I go on trusting
Boys like you
You're gone and buried
The cemetery
Boy, ain't it scary
R.I.P you're dead to me
You're gone and buried
I hope you're ready
Boy, ain't it scary
R.I.P you're dead to me
Cross my broken heart, I hope I you die, die
Cross my broken heart, I hope you die, die
R.I.P you're dead to me
God knows how I tried
I might forgive you
In another life
But this time 'round
It's not worth sacrificing
Even if I could
Me and my girls, yeah, call us a coven
When it comes lovin'
They got my back when I go on trusting
Boys, like you
You're gone and buried
The cemetery
Boy, ain't it scary
R.I.P you're dead to me
You're gone and buried
I hope you're ready
Boy, ain't it scary
R.I.P you're dead to me
Cross my broken heart, I hope, you die, die
Cross my broken heart, I hope, you die, die
R.I.P you're dead to me
Cross my broken heart, I hope, you die, die
Cross my broken heart, I hope, you die, die
R.I.P you're dead to me
