Song Name: make you feel pretty
Over on the corner of Sunset and Doheny
Up the stairs and on the rocks
That's is where she left me waiting
Waiting, so she could get high
She doesn't do it often
Only every weekend
Sometimes on a Tuesday
When she don't really feel like sleeping
Sleeping, through the night
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars
They're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous, that's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
You sound like you're from London
I know you're from Ohio
What have I been drinking?
What the fuck do I know?
Lately, lately I'm out of my mind

Oh, I could use a Xanax
Maybe that'll fix this
She's like an addiction
Something I ain't kicking easy, easy
Am I wasting my time?
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars
They're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous, that's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
Oh my God
My life is such a mess

Oh my God
I think that I need some rest
She moved in my apartment
Now I don't sleep often
Drinking this concoction
Have I really lost it?
Maybe, maybe I'm out of my mind

Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars
They're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous, that's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
Don't wanna be nameless
You wanna be famous, that's fine
I'm spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
