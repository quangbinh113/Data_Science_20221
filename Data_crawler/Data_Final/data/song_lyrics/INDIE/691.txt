Song Name: All For Us - from the HBO Original Series Euphoria
Oh
Taking it all for us
Taking it all
Taking it all for us
Oh
Doing it all for love
Doing it all
Doing it all for love
Taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
(Doing it all) Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh
Too much in my system (famine, famine)
Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
Mama making ends meet (making ends meet)
Working like a slave (Mississippi, aye-aye)
Daddy ain't at home, no (Father, Father)
Gotta be a man (Michael Corleone)
Do it for my homegrowns (sisters, brothers)
Do it for the fam (yeah, so tell 'em Labby)
Ey! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just for your love, yeah, I'll
Give you the world
Mona Lisa's smile
Hey (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'll do 25 to life
If it makes me a king
A star in your eyes
Guilty or innocent
My love is infinite, I'm giving it
No need for prisoners
Bitch please, hands up, this is a stick up 'cause I'm
Hey, yeah
I'm taking it
Yeah-eh
I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh

Guess you figured my two times two
Always equates to one
Dreamers are selfish
When it all comes down to it
I hope one of you come back to remind me of who I was
When I go disappearing
Into that good night (good night)

I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
(Doing it all) Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh
