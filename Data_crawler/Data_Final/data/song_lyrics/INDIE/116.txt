Song Name: Glitter
Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin' what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
Where I can't feel my face
Mmm, minds twisted in weird ways
Wonderin' what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
Glitter sparklin' on your heart
Now, darlin', won't you stay?
I'm here wonderin' what to say
You're pullin' me away now
I know it's gettin' late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
Race against the sunlight
Wanna have a long night
Night mysteries, night mysteries
Under spotlight
Don't let me out of your sight
Two energies, two energies
Glitter sparklin' on your heart
Now, darlin', won't you stay? (Ooh)
I'm here wonderin' what to say
You're pullin' me away now
I know it's gettin' late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
I know it's gettin' late now, baby (late now)
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party (party)
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin' what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
