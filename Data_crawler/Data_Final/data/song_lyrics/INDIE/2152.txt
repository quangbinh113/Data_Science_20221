Song Name: Slowing Down
The sound of laughter
Echoes from a few doors down
The sound of pressure
Is getting louder
Whisper in my ear
That you need me
But if you saw it clearly
Would you leave me?
I'm honest to you
But I'm lying to myself
And I don't want to hear it
It has something to do
With the balance of my blood
And when I'll have to spill it
People moving faster
Am I the only one that's slowing down?
Am I slowing you down?
Whisper in my ear
That you need me
But if you saw it clearly
You would leave me
Alone in California
The dream is dimming
The second time I've heard that voice
And it's getting louder
