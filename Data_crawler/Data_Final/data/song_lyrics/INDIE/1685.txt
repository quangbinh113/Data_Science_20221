Song Name: All You Do
Help me out
I can't take the way my face blurs in a crowd
Drive around
Show up uninvited, conversate too loud
I only drink when I'm drunk
Can't fall asleep on my own
I only wanna have some fun
Let the party never end
I'll send you my favorite songs
Yeah, that's neat
I promise that we could be so complete
All you do
Is good
I live for the moment
I cry when it's over
So hold me like you should
All you do
Is good
I live for the moment
I die when it's over
So hold me like you should
Heard you found
Something like a passion
To keep your feet on the ground
Look around
What if all these people
Were trees growing up through the clouds?
Talk about (I only drink when I'm drunk)
Anything to keep my mind from checking out (can't force me on my own)
Don't leave now (I only wanna have some fun)
Stick around and let the party never end
You'll send me your favorite songs
Yeah, that's sweet
I promise that we could be so complete
All you do
Is good
I live for the moment
I cry when it's over
So hold me like you should
All you do
Is good
I live for the moment
I die when it's over
So hold me like you should
Is anybody out there?
You're so out there (so hold me like you should)
I could be with all these people
And still feel alone
But I'm not scared
Because I'm home
All you do
Is good
I live for the moment
I cry when it's over
So hold me like you should
All you do (everything that I try)
Is good (hold me close and I'll feel alive)
I live for the moment (it's alright)
I die when it's over
So hold me like you should (we'll drift a little longer tonight)
All you do (everything that I try)
Is good (hold me close and I'll feel alive)
I live for the moment (it's alright)
I cry when it's over
So hold me like you should (we'll drift a little longer tonight)
All you do (everything that I try)
Is good (hold me close and I'll feel alive)
I live for the moment (it's alright)
I die when it's over
So hold me like you should (we'll drift a little longer tonight)
