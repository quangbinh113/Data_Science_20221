Song Name: Girls
I like the girls that do drugs
Girls with cigarettes in the back of the club
Girls that hate cops and buy guns
Girls with no buns
Girls that's mean just for fun
I like girls who make love
But I love girls who like to fuck
That's what's up
I like
Tall girls
Small girls
Girls with dicks Call girls
Girls who get naked on the gram
They say
I'm too fucking horny
Wanna put me in a cage
I'd probably fuck the hole in the wall
The guy before made
I like girls who're pregnant
Girls who give it up for lent
Girls who're so fucking kinky that they're bent
I like the girls that do drugs
Girls with cigarettes in the back of the club
Girls that hate cops and buy guns
Girls with no buns
Girls that's mean just for fun
I like girls who make love
But I love girls who like to fuck
That's what's up
I like the girls that do drugs
I like the girls who like to lie that they came
Girls who fuck on the train
Girls who got so much hair on their ass it clogs the drain
I like girls who got degrees
Girls on killing sprees
I like girls who got a bone to pick with me
I like the girls that do drugs
Girls with cigarettes in the back of the club
Girls that hate cops and buy guns
Girls with no buns
Girls that's mean just for fun
I like girls who make love
But I love girls who like to fuck
That's what's up
