Song Name: dirty laundry
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry
And I think that she knows
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
With all of this money, they all want something from me
It's starting to show
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
Man, I can't see shit in the spotlight
She found receipts from the last night
In the back of my jeans, keep it real, right?
I just want to fuck and feel real, right?
Work long all day 'til the night time
She wants to know what's the deal like
I think that she knows, can't keep seal tight
Doing all these things that you want like
Girls with cocaine on they backsides, I know
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, let's go
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry
And I think that she knows
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
With all of this money, they all want something from me
It's starting to show
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
Ooh, yeah (ooh, yeah)
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, I know
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
My girl don't want me (nah)
Ooh, I want to tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more (I can't lie no more)
Ooh, I want to tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more (I can't lie no more)
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I can't hide it no more
Ooh-ooh (I can't hide it no more)
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry
And I think that she knows (I think she knows)
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
With all of this money, they all want something from me (want something from me)
It's starting to show (starting to show)
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
I'm out of control (I'm out of control)
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, I know
