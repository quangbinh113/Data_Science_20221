Song Name: Losing Interest
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on (just let me)
Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
