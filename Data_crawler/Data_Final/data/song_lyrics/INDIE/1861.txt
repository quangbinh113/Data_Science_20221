Song Name: Beautiful Mind
I've got a feeling I can't shake
Your body appealing in my bed
Oh, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
You know that I missed you
I should've kissed you back in NYC
And I have an issue, I need a tissue
When you're thinking of me
And all of this damage I cannot handle
I can set you free if you're down
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
Tell me you love me
Or push me away
I'm begging to leave
But you're making mе stay
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your bеautiful eyes
Remember our first date?
We were cruising 'round town on a Friday
Left your phone at the arcade
But your curfew at ten so it's too late
But we can forget about that town
Because it's all behind us now
And we can pretend that we don't care
That we were never even there

Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
You're making me crazy, you're making me numb
'Cause this shit is pointless so fuck it, I'm done
I wanted forever but sometimes I'm wrong
My boy is a killer, his love is a gun
And I think he's worth it, his mind is the worst
Leave scars on my body, I love when it hurts
Addicted to poison 'cause I miss the pain
My world is not worth it, this life is so great
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
Yes, I wanna swim inside
Your beautiful mind
Your beautiful eyes
