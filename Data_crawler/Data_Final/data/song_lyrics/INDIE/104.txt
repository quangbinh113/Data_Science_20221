Song Name: Scrawny
Used to be level with all my friends
Still wear the same shoes I did back then
I don't think they've ever been untied
I can't regret the things I don't try
I'd switch it up but I don't like change
Only content if things stay the same
Don't care to watch the story unfold
Hate feeling like I'm not in control
I've been sleeping with the light on
I tend to freak myself out
Will you come a little closer
Now and tell me I'm a
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
I'm a scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
I say the wrong shit at the right times
If I'm offending them I don't mind
Maybe they all should listen to me
It isn't all about what you see
Question though how do I look to you?
Am I so thin that you could see through?
I've been sleeping with the light off
I wanted to remember
Will you come a little closer now
And see that I'm a
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
I'm a scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle

I'll be one of those people you remember
They'll be looking at us when were together
I'll be a mannequin you can dismember
You don't like my clothes but you still like my smile
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
Take me home to mom but it'll take awhile
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
They might think they're cooler than me by a mile
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
I can still have wisdom and look like a child
Scrawny motherfucker with a cool hairstyle
