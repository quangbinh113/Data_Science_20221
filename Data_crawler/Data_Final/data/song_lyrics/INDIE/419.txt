Song Name: Angel
Congratulations, you've been pretending to be human so well
Might even fool the neighbours
Reading your sunday papers, I won't tell
But I know better than to bring up the
Weather with you and talk about the rain
After you fall asleep I'll kiss both your
Eyes and cheeks, I know we're not the same

You're an angel in disguise
You're an angel in my eyes
I bought a house to live in but you're the home I'm missin', I know
Nothing good lasts forever but nights with you are better, so, go slow
I never knew I needed you before I found you for the first time
Mmm
I'm out of step, I'm off my feet, I'm waking up inside a dream
Teach me how to fly
You're an angel in disguise
You're an angel in my eyes
Aah, aah, woohoo, woohoo
Aah, aah, woohoo, woohoo
You're an angel
In my eyes
You're an angel
Are you mine, mine, mine tonight?
Tonight
Woohoo
Tonight, tonight
Woohoo, woohoo
