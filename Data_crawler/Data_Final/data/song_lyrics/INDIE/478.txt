Song Name: ocean eyes
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
15 flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair (no fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Mmm, mmm, mmm
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
