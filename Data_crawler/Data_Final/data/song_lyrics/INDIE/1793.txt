Song Name: I'm Not In Love
I'm not in love
But I don't hate you
My feelings fall right down the middle
Is that an issue?
All the time that we had spent
That's just a happy accident
I'm not in love
But I do like you
But, baby, I'm not getting butterflies
When I look into your ocean eyes
And we fall into salty sweet goodbyes
'Cause everything is temporary, yeah
We're a bit too comfortable for both of our likings
Soon, we're struck by lightning
Odds are all the same
But dopamine is pretty hard to come by
So, you got me trekking my brain
'Cause I'm not in love (I'm not in love)
But I don't hate you (But I don't hate you)
My feelings fall right down the middle
Is that an issue? (Issue, issue)
All the time that we had spent
That's just a happy accident
I'm not in love
But I do like you (My God)
