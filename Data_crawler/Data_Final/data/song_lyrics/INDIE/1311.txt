Song Name: Now & Then
Two kids growing up together
You didn't know what I was up to
Asked you out in my little round way
Down down shooting me down
You held me tight
So I wouldn't cry but you
You don't remember
We all remember different sides
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
We grew from one to another
Learning what we would fall into
Attraction tells when what want most
Found found heard where I'd gone
Somethings had changed
But others stayed the same
And you
You had your stories
Some different stories I'd left behind
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
I knew then what I know now
I may lose it for a second now and then
