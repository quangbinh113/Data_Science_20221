Song Name: Running Up That Hill - Spotify Singles
No me duele (yeah-yeah, yo)
¿Quieres sentir lo que sentí? (Yeah-yeah, yo)
¿Quieres saber, ver que no me duele? (Yeah-yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal I'm making?
Tú
It's you and me
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building, yeah
Ya no puede dolerme
Yo sé que nunca es tu intención
Sin querer, a ti también te hiere
Atormentando el corazón
Y si hay algo más que solo este amor
Dime si importamos, baby
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God (make a deal with God)
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building, yeah
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God (make a deal with God)
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill (I'd be running up that hill)
With no problems
Come on, baby
Come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh, oh, oh
I'd be running up that hill
