Song Name: overwhelmed
To report suspicious activity
(You can call 9-1-1 for immediate response)
(And there's still no working cure for the virus)
Turn off the T.V, it's starting to freak me
Out it's so loud, it's like my ears are bleeding
What am I feeling? Can't look at the ceiling
Light is so bright, it's like I'm over-heating
This mind isn't mine, who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine, but it's all too much
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed
All of these faces who don't know what space is
And crowds are shut down, I'm over-stimulated
Nobody gets it, say I'm too sensitive
I can't listen 'cause I'm eyeing the exits
This mind isn't mine, who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine, but it's all too much
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed
I get overwhelmed
(To report suspicious activity)
(You can call 9-1-1 for immediate response)
(And there's still no working cure for the virus)
I should be fine, but it's all too much
I should be fine, but I'm not (not)
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
Keeps me silent
(Keeps me silent)
What's come over me?
Somebody, somebody else
I get overwhelmed
