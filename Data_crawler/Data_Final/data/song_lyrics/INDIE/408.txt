Song Name: (Can We Be Friends?)
Could you be my best friend?
Let's hang out every weekend
We're driving every night
Stare at people that we like
Could you be my best friend?
I'll tell you all my secrets
I'll tell you all the times
That I wished that I could die
And if anybody fucks with you
They fuck with me
So, if anybody fucks with you
I'll knock their teeth out (yeah)
Could you be my best friend?
Can we be friends?
Could you be my best friend?
Can we be friends?
