Song Name: Save
Through the night
All the lights are passing by us
You decide
You're not holding onto my love
I've been wrong more than twice, but I keep on falling
Back and forth without a clue
Yeah, I know what is right, yet I still ignore it
Finding my way back to you
Save me from all of the things I've done, lately I'm lost
Save me from all that I've become, till I become yours
Save me from all of the things I've done, lately I'm lost
Save me from all that I've become, till I become yours
Too damn hard, to say goodbye
Keep wanting more for you and I
All these dreams caught in my mind
In my mind (In my mind)
I've been wrong more than twice, but I keep on falling
Back and forth without a clue
Yeah, I know what is right, yet I still ignore it
Finding my way back to you
Save me from all of the things I've done, lately I'm lost
Save me from all that I've become, till I become yours
Save me from all of the things I've done, lately I'm lost
Save me from all that I've become, till I become yours
(Save me from all of the things I've done, lately I'm lost)
(Save me from all that I've become, till I become yours)
