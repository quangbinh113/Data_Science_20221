Song Name: Pumpkin
We're heavy liftin' but we're feelin' fine
We think it's funny when we look at the time
I know co-dependency has dragged me out
But I really don't think that's what this is about
I wanna give it all, I know I will
'Cause blueberry eyes seem to make time still
We can boogie in the sunshine with some Burt's Bees
And I know you like to pull the leaves off trees
I used to think that Romeo was full of shit
And the Notebook was just my favorite chick flick
But now I get why Sarah was so hard to forget
It's this feeling that I'm feeling like Nemo in a net
Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
I need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
We're cruisin' slowly but we're movin' fast
We both decided to thank our past
We've got a hundred lists of things we wanna do
But I'm also cool just doin' nothin' with you
I ran in circles on a Monday night
You had to go so you could make your flight
I looked at my mom and said, "What do I do?"
She said, "This look is somethin' and it's new and true"
I used to think that Romeo was full of shit
And the Notebook was just my favorite chick flick
But now I get why Sarah was so hard to forget
It's this feeling that I'm feeling like Nemo in a net
Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
Need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
I used to think that Romeo was full of shit
But when I look at you I think this must be it
Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
I need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Oh
Pumpkin, pumpkin, oh
La la la la la, la-la
Ooh-ooh
