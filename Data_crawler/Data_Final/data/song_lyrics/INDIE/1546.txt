Song Name: caroline
Oh, oh, my
Don't wanna see you high and dry
Oh, Caroline
Look at me just one more time
Just one more time, oh-oh-oh-oh
Just one more time, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, my
The things you say just make me cry
Oh, my Caroline
Would you see me one more time?
Oh, Caroline, oh-oh-oh-oh
Just one more time, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't get too hung up
Don't you try to make me feel the same again
Don't get too caught up, my dear
It's alright, I know it's not the way it was
Oh, Caroline, oh-oh-oh-oh
Just one more time, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, Caroline, oh-oh-oh-oh
Just one more time, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Caroline, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Caroline
