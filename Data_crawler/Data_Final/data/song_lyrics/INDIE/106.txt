Song Name: 1980s Horror Film II
She was only seventeen
Oh, why are girls in songs always seventeen?
She was from a movie scene
And now she plays in my head all day
She called me up
And let me in
I couldn't feel my legs
She walked me back
Into her room
But just to see
A 1980s horror film
I, oh, I was so scared
She had the curtains down, so there was no glare
She pulled up a chair and gave me the bed
And all these crazy things went through my head
It seems so long
I need someone
I don't know what to say
She was sitting there
I could touch her hair
But still we watched
A 1980s horror film
Jamie
I don't know what to say to you
I feel
You're always on my mind
And now that I know what I need
I'm taking the long way round in my mind
It's not right
I can't help the way I feel anymore
And I need to ask you, Jamie
Oh, can it be that you feel this way, too?
The lights were off
The mood was right
She came and laid with me
I looked into her eyes
Tried to make her mine
But then she said
I'm really not that into guys
1980s horror film
1980s horror film
1980s horror film
1980s horror film
