Song Name: Scissorhands
I mind my business but you keep pullin' me down
I warned you this won't end well

Swear that I want to
What I touch goes up in flames
I wish that I could change
Oh (oh), everybody starin' at me, oh (oh)
Since you're lookin', I'll put on a fuckin' show (show)
This is what you chose
Why can't no one understand
I got scissors for my hands?
Hold you closer but I can't
I-I-I don't wanna kill a man
Don't come near
Nothing good will come from here
Your scratches won't disappear
I-I-I got, I got scissors for my hands

Scissors for my hands
I-I-I got, I got scissors for my-
Tiny blades, so I'm alone
Hurt everybody 10 feet from me
I'm only safe when I'm alone
I'm not okay, but I'm okay with it
Oh (oh), everybody starin' at me, oh (oh)
Like I'm a freak but they don't even really know (know)
They don't really know
Why can't no one understand
I got scissors for my hands? (my hands)
Hold you closer but I can't
I-I-I don't wanna kill a man (kill a man)
Don't come near
Nothing good will come from here
Your scratches won't disappear
I-I-I got, I got scissors for my hands

Scissors for my hands
I-I-I got, I got scissors for my hands
I-I-I got, I got scissors for my hands
