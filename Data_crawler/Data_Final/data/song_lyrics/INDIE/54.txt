Song Name: Why Do You Feel So Down
I can't speak and I can't listen
And everyone is a curse or something worse
What can I say to the kid that made you
Complaining like you were made to
When you hate every god I pray to
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I'd like to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
I've gone weak and I'm sick of speaking
So hear me out you're the cure or something more
I think you're one of a kind so I'll never like myself
I think you're older and wiser so I won't let you tell
I think it over and over and hope you're thinking too
I think it over and over and hope I'm over you
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
Everyone, I messed up again

Everyone, I messed up again, ohh
Everyone, I messed up again
Everyone
Ohhh
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
Why do you feel so down?
