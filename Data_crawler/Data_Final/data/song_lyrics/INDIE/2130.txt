Song Name: Sunset
These days I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right, and right, and right instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me back into your arms again
So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride away
(Hey!)
So many stories we were told about a safety net (Hey!)
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn thе sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright bеcause it hides the dirt and hides the wine
So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride away
No regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride away
