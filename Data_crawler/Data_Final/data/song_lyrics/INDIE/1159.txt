Song Name: The Only Boy Awake
Through your window
By the water
Can you see me
When the wind blows
Through empty quarters
You will never know
'Cause you'd already know by now
When your love grew
I was there too
I should have told you
I'm the only boy awake now
Gazing at the stars
I dive into the blue and You.
I never had to walk like this before
I never had to hide away
I don't really want to talk like this no more
I will walk until the night turns to day - and you
