Song Name: Hate Me
You cut my breaks
Then kiss on my face
So where are you coming from?
Can't read the signs
So I draw the line
Then you go and bend it some
The moment everything is said
Your words they bring me back again
It's so insane the things we do
In the name of love
My friends they say
I should run away
And change all my information
But I hold you close
So how could I go
When you are my destination?
These thoughts they got me conflicted
But it's too late, now I'm addicted
It's so insane the things we do
In the name of love
Got both feet on the edge
Are you gonna come and save me?
I'll take one final step
All you have to do is make me
If you ever walk away I won't think twice
I'll go bye, bye, bye
Even though that it hurts me, baby
I'm in love with the way you hate me
You spike my drink
Then give me a wink
And pour me another cup
I'm so aware
But I still don't care
You already fucked me up
And I know that I got a couple issues
But it's fine, keep playing with my loose screws
It's so insane the things we do
In the name of love
Damn you always get your way
Guess it's written in your nature
You know everything to say
Just as long as I'm in danger
But I like when you take me under
It feels so good when I suffer
It's so insane the things we do
In the name of love
Got both feet on the edge
Are you gonna come and save me?
I'll take one final step
All you have to do is make me
If you ever walk away I won't think twice
I'll go bye, bye, bye
Even though that it hurts me, baby
I'm in love with the way you hate me
I know that I'm stupid, I make a mistake
And repeat it a million times
But it's better to see your familiar face
Even though it's been killing my mind
I know that I'm stupid, I make a mistake
And repeat it a million times
The pain and the evil it's bad for my brain
But it's beautiful here in my eyes
(Yeah yeah yeah) Got both feet on the edge
Are you gonna come and save me?
I'll take one final step
All you have to do is make me
If you ever walk away I won't think twice
I'll go bye, bye, bye
'Cause even though that it hurts me, baby
I'm in love with the way you hate me
I know that I'm stupid, I make a mistake
And repeat it a million times
(I'm in love with the way you hate me)
I know that I'm stupid, I make a mistake
And repeat it a million times
(I'm in love with the way you hate me)
If you ever leave me, no it ain't no lie
I'll end my life
'Cause even though that it hurts me, baby
I'm in love with the way you hate me
