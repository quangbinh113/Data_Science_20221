Song Name: By Your Side
You aren't sure what I remember this time
It's a very old song
I only have eyes for you
Everything I take, we see!
Everything I take, we see!
Alright!
Everything I take, we see!
Alright!
You aren't sure what I remember this time
It's a very old song
I only have eyes for you
Everything we see! Everything we see! Everything we see! Everything we see!
Everything we see! Everything we see! Everything we see! Everything we see!
Alright!
Everything I take, we...
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
You aren't sure what I remember this time
It's a very old song
I only have eyes for you
