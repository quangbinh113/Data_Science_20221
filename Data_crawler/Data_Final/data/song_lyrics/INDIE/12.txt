Song Name: Fool
I am just a fool to keep on chasin' after nothing great
You are just a fool to keep pretendin' that you're lovin' me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Call me on the phone at three, I talk to you while half asleep
Complaining 'bout your mother so I take you to the cemetery
Rant to me, I like the sound, I like your voice, I like your mouth
Oh
Oh-oh
Mm-mm-m
Cycling to school at 7:30 in the morning
I am still your baby boy, I'm stuck in 2013
Don't understand my body
Washing machine confuses me
Oh
Oh-oh
Mm-mm-m
I am such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
You are such a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I was such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
You were such a fool to keep pretendin' that you're lovin' me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go
(Look in the mirror, I love that boy, don't hurt my dear, don't hurt my joy)

Oh
Oh-oh
