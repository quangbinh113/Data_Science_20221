Song Name: Special
Yeah I know you're one of those guys
The artistic type with them womanizer eyes
Yesterday reminds me of deep blue
Sitting in that staircase with you
Tried to justify the reasons you ain't my baby
We both know those are lies
But when I'm with you the world melts away
Wish you would be mine again
All my friends go to art school
Shit I guess that makes me feel kinda cool and
I feel like I'm drowning in a kiddie pool
You say that I'm so special, you think that you're so special
Like this was something special
Don't call me special anymore
Remember when I hated your guts
Some stupid shit, guess that's what was up
Though you'll talk nice just to get in my pants
Then leave me with no warnings in advance
Said you were with it but I think that you're high
But we both know babe, I don't mind
When I'm with you the world melts away
Wish you would be mine again
All my friends go to art school
Shit I guess that makes me feel kinda cool and
I feel like I'm drowning in a kiddie pool
You say that I'm so special, you think that you're so special
Like this was something special
Don't call me special anymore
All my friends go to art school
Shit I guess that makes me feel kinda cool and
I feel like I'm drowning in a kiddie pool
You say that I'm so special, you think that you're so special
Like this was something special
Don't call me special anymore
Don't call me special anymore
