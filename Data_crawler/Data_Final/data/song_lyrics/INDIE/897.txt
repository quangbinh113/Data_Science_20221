Song Name: Changes
I'm getting rid of all my clothes, I don't wear
I think I'm gonna cut my hair
'Cause these days I don't feel like me, mmm
I think I'm gonna take a break from alcohol
Probably won't last that long
But Lord knows I could use some sleep, mmm
Changes, they might drive you half-insane
But it's killing you to stay the same
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments, living with your eyes half-open
You've been thinking 'bout these changes
It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
I think I'm gonna take some pills to fix my brain
'Cause I tried every other way
But some things you can't fix yourself
But instead, he's doing the same thing over and over
And life ain't easy these days, no, life ain't easy these days
Changes, they might drive you half-insane
But it's killing you to stay the same
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments, living with your eyes half-open
You've been thinking 'bout these changes
It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Changes, they might drive you half-insane
But it's killing you to stay the same
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments, living with your eyes half-open
You've been thinking 'bout these changes
It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
