Song Name: Paracetamol
There's a boy, fifteen, with a gun in his hand
And the people with no audience say should be hanged
They ask for his motive but they don't understand
Why they love like they do, like they do
There's a girl, fifteen, with her head in a noose
Because she's damned to live, well she's damned to choose
And the animals walked in twos by twos
Showing love like they do, like they do
There's a girl, fifteen, although she isn't sure
Well how the hell could you want anything more
Beautiful, perfect, immaculate whore
I'm in love, love with you, love with you
Oh won't you let me finish
You drive me insane
The world will keep on turning
Even if we're not the same
Don't come on to me, come on to me
There's a boy, fifteen, turning into a man
Well tell me one other thing that he can
While you forced a smile through a jealous hand
Showing love like you do, like you do
There's a boy, fifteen, and he's attempted to sue
Cause he's definitely sure that it's true
What kind of man, kind of man are you
Showing love like you do, like you do
Oh won't you let me finish
You drive me insane
The world will keep on turning
Even if we're not the same
Don't come on to me, come on to me

So tell me what's in your mind, so tell me what's in your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So tell me what's in your mind, so tell me what's in your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So tell me what's in your mind, so tell me what's in your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So tell me what's in your mind, so tell me what's in your mind
You're emotionally challenged
Why do you waste you waste your time
The world around you's manic
Do you have no shame
Come on to me, come on to me
