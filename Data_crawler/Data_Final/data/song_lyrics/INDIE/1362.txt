Song Name: Summer Love
I'm so elated
I've hit a wall
And I don't wanna turn around
It's complicated
I'll burn it down
Enough about me
Tell me do you get around
Dreamin' of the day you finally let me in
Dreamin' of the day you finally catch a hint
Dreamin' of, dreamin' of
Summer Love
Baby don't let me down
Summer Love
You're underrated
I'll settle down
First I gotta catch my breath
Whatchu sayin'
You're better now
Enough about that
Tell me do you think of me
Dreamin' of the day you finally let me in
Dreamin' of the day you finally catch a hint
Dreamin' of, dreamin' of
Summer Love
Baby don't let me down
Summer Love
I'm fallin' now in front of you
And you don't seem to have a clue as to
Are you so opposed to love so true
Dreamin' of the day you finally let me in
Dreamin' of the day you finally catch a hint
Dreamin' of, dreamin' of
Summer Love
Baby don't let me down
Summer Love
Wait a minute
I hear a sound
Telling me to watch my step
Let me weigh in
It's heavy now
I'm not about that
Think I'll put you back where I found you
Think I'll put you back where I found you
