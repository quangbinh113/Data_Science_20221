Song Name: LUCID
Oh, oh
You know lately
Oh, oh
I've been dreaming
Dreaming about you
I've been lucid dreaming just to see you
I've been taking all this medicine, yeah
Are you real or a hallucination? (I don't know)
I-I got to know (I got to know, I got to know, hey)
Hey girl, you are what I've been looking for, oh, oh-oh, ooh
(You're what I'm dreaming of)
'Cause, hey girl, you are what I've been dreaming of, oh, oh-oh, ooh
(Dreaming of, dreaming of)
Come be my stranger in the dark
Don't need nobody in my arms
Got my imagination running wild
It's all that I can do
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Give me your love) (oh-oh, ooh)
I've been searching for a lonely pleasure (yeah)
Ever since that day, I'm not the same (haven't been the same lately)
But this kind of pain, this kind of treasure
I won't take it slow (won't take it slow, won't take it slow, hey)
Hey girl, you are what I've been looking for, oh, oh-oh, ooh
(What I've been waiting for)
'Cause, hey girl, you are what I've been dreaming of, oh, ooh
(You're everything I'm dreaming of, let's go)
Come be my stranger in the dark (let's go)
Don't need nobody in my arms (no, no)
Got my imagination running wild
It's all that I can do
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
You are my weakness
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
(Oh-oh, ooh)
All that I can do
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Oh, ooh
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
Oh, ooh
You are my weakness
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
No-no, no-no, no-no
Lucid dreams, lucid dreams 'bout you ('bout you)
You know lately
I've been dreaming
Dreaming about you
