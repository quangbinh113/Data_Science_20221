Song Name: Wave
Baby let me ride your wave
Make me feel alive every day
Baby let me ride your wave
'Cause no one else
Can make me feel this way
Sunny California, sipping on cheap sodas
Watching how the sun goes down
Don't want it to end yet
Tell me 'bout your friends yeah
I don't wanna go right now
Take my hand
Don't let go
Show me 'round
All night long
Baby let me ride your wave
Make me feel alive every day
Baby let me ride your wave
'Cause no one else
Can make me feel this way
Take my hand
Don't let go
Show me 'round
All night long (1, 2, 3, 4)
Baby let me ride your wave
Make me feel alive every day
Baby let me ride your wave
'Cause no one else
Can make me feel this way
