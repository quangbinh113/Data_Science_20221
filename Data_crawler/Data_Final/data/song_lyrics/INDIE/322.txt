Song Name: Baby I'm Yours
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the stars fall from the sky
Yours (yours) until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time
I'm gonna stay right here, by your side
And do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in the world could drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three
Yours (yours) until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity
Baby, I'm yours (ooh)
'Til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours
Until the sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours
Until the poets run out of rhyme
Baby, I'm yours
