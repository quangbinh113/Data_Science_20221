Song Name: Weekend
On the weekend
You'll find your way and lose it again
You know, now I've told you
That your head is much more bent
With her voice she said
I'd die for you any day
My life's over anyway
Let's go to the empty park
And talk 'til it's really dark
In the day time, we'll think about the sun 'til it sets
(Oh-whoa-ohh-oh)
You notice a difference in the way we comprehend
With her voice she said
I'd die for you any day
My life's over anyway
Let's go to the empty park
And talk 'til it's really dark
I'll take you to the park
I'll take you to the ocean
I'll kiss you 'til it's dark
We'll go through all the motions
I'll take you to the park
(Can we make the world go round?)
I'll take you to the ocean
I'll kiss you 'til it's dark
(Make the world go round)
We'll go through all the motions
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it? (oh-whoa-ohh-oh)
Do you really want it? (oh-whoa-ohh-oh)
Do you really want it? (oh-whoa-ohh-oh)
Do you really want it? (oh-whoa-ohh-oh)
