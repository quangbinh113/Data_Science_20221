Song Name: Come On Let's Go
You won't find it by yourself
You're gonna need some help
And you won't fail with me around
Come on, let's go
I will tell you if you change
And who's been saying things
It's hard to tell who is real in here
Come on, let's go
You know who to turn to, now everything's changed
Come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face
Come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time
On people that you'll never know?
Come on, let's go
When you're looking for a friend
But it's empty at the end
When everybody's disappeared
You won't be alone
If you want, I'll compensate
If you overestimate
So there's nothing left to fear
You won't be alone
You know who to turn to, now everything's changed
Come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face
Come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time
On things that you'll never know?
Come on, let's go
You know who to turn to, now everything's changed
Come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face
Come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time
On people that you'll never know?
When you know who to turn to, now everything's changed
