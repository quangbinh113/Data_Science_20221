Song Name: Tides
We cloud people, we live in gray
What we don't need release in rain
We cloud people, we never stay
We hold our freedom like a plane
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
I'm not supposed to feel, I'm not supposed to miss
How am I supposed to heal? How am I supposed to fit?
A little awkward then a little oxygen
I let you get away, I held the ocean in
We cloud people, we live in gray
If you love me, let me float away
We won't be dry soon (won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon (won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon (won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
