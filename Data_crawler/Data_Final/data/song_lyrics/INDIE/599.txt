Song Name: I'm Not Ok
I can be a handful
But that's why you have two hands
I'm not ever careful
And I can be rude, yeah
You can be a red light stop
Or run right through
I can be a danger, danger for you
Too many issues, so I wouldn't blame you
Mirror of bad, I've got no excuse
I talk to myself, self
I think I need help, help
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
I'm bad for my health, health
My head's on a shelf, shelf
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
Drinking on a Monday
Feeling unstable, yeah
You said "You're doing it the wrong way"
Then you got up on a table
I could be a one night stand you crash into
Wake up on the pavement half past two
Too many issues, so I wouldn't blame you
Mirror of bad, I've got no excuse
I talk to myself, self
I think I need help, help
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
I'm bad for my health, health
My head's on a shelf, shelf
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
I'm just like everyone else
Fucked up like everyone else
I'm just like everyone else
Fucked up like everyone else
I talk to myself, self
I think I need help, help
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
I'm bad for my health, health
My head's on a shelf, shelf
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay?
I'm na-na-na not okay
I sing to myself, self (self)
Who needs to get well, well (well)
So what if I'm na-na-na not okay? (I'm not)
I'm na-na-na not okay
