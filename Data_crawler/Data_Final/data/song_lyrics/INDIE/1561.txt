Song Name: Painkillers
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made
Painkillers
Count your blessings early before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes
Painkillers
Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief
My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand

And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run
What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young
Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing
Prescription made
Painkillers
