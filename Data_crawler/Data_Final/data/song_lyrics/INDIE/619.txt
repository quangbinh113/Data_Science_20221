Song Name: Cruel Love (feat. shYbeast & FRANK ZUMMO)
I woke up last night
I thought about flying, yeah
Across the state line
To show you that I
That I'm always trying, yeah
But I always fail
I'm getting too good at goodbyes
Yeah, I don't know why I even said hi
Can we just forget that we fight?
I don't wanna win
Just want this to end
I'm driving too long
I don't know where I'm going
But I can't be far off
If you find love
In someone who reminds you of me
You're better off
It's not what I wanted
Is it what you wanted?
Am I the only one?
I give it all
I give it all to you
It's cruel love
It's cruel love you do
It's that cruel love
That cruel love you do
It feels like yesterday
Everything feels so far away
Cruel love
Yeah, cruel love will do
I woke up last night
I dreamt that I called you
The first time in months
We didn't speak once
No, we didn't have to
To know how we feel
If I can just turn off the clocks
Would you make the time
No more blurry lines
Did you just forget all those nights
You fell like a fool
What I put you through
I'm driving too long
I don't know where I'm going
But I can't be far off
If you find love
In someone who reminds you of me
You're better off
It's not what I wanted
Is it what you wanted
Am I the only one?
I give it all
I give it all to you
It's cruel love
It's cruel love you do
It's that cruel love
That cruel love you do
It feels like yesterday
Everything feels so far away
Cruel love
Yeah, cruel love will do
