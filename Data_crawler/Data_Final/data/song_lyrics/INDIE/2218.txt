Song Name: I Can't Hate You
It's not fair
Yeah, I know
I just wish I could be there with you

Yeah, it's not fair
Yeah, I know
I just wish I could be there with you
But I can't
I just wanna scream back at the world
I just wanna leave
But it make things worse
I just wanna hate you
But I can't
No, I can't, no, I can't
I've been going through this on my own
Did you even care when I was gone?
I just wanna hate you
But I can't
No, I can't, no, I can't
'Cause we got a lot of love
But it don't make sense
'Cause we argue all the time
Baby, it's about time that we go
And start over
Yeah, we got a lot of love
But it don't make sense
It's a pain in my chest
I just wanna see you again
But maybe it's for the best
It's not fair
Yeah, I know
I just wish I could be there with you
Yeah, it's not fair
Yeah, I know
I just wish I could be there with you
But I can't
I just wanna scream back at the world
I just wanna leave
But it make things worse
I just wanna hate you
But I can't
No, I can't, no, I can't
I've been going through this on my own
Did you even care when I was gone?
I just wanna hate you
But I can't
No, I can't, no, I can't
'Cause we got a lot of love
But it don't make sense
'Cause we argue all the time
Baby, it's about time that we go
And start over
Yeah, we got a lot of love
But it don't make sense
It's a pain in my chest
I just wanna see you again
But maybe it's for the best
It's not fair
Yeah, I know
I just wish I could be there with you
But I can't
