Song Name: Life
Momma said that the growing pains won't end
It's the little bitty waves
That'll keep the tide at bay
Time flies through imaginary lines
That hazy winter day
Moving only in a daze
Life moves slowly
Life moves slowly
Life moves so slow
It makes me wonder where it goes
I stay dreaming
Of a place nobody knows
Life moves slowly
Life moves slowly
You should have known better, better
You should have known better, better
We could have been better, better
We could have been better, better
Life moves slowly
Life moves slowly
