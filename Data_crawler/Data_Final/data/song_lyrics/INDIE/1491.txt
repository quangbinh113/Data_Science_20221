Song Name: Moon in the Morning
I keep an extra towel
It's hung up by the door
I have another charger now
A toothbrush in the drawer
I set you a place
A table made for two
I'm living on a "Just in case"
There's always room for you
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over, the same old story now
Is it so much to ask?
You lay in the bed for a moment
Say it isn't a dream
Why can't you stay here with me?
Darling, when you go
Does he know where you come?
And how you let me hold you on
The dark side of the Sun?
Does he smell my cologne (my cologne)
Mixed with your perfume? (With your perfume)
And does he know you're late for work (late for work)
Whenever I'm with you?
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over, the same old story now
Is it so much to ask?
You lay in the bed for a moment
Say it isn't a dream
Why can't you stay here with me?
You go like the moon in the morning (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You go like the moon in the morning (ooh-ooh)
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over, the same old story now
