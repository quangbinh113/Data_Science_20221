Song Name: Female Energy, Part 2
Oh, and I'm falling into the arms of naked truth
Not surprised to see the sky and only think of you
Tell me, how am I to feel?
Tell me how
I don't know if I can deal
I need to scream it loud
Oh, and I'm falling into the arms of naked truth
Not surprised to see the sky and know what I must do
Tell me, how am I to feel?
Tell me how
Oh, and I'm falling into the arms of naked truth
Not surprised to see myself reflecting the universe
Am I to feel bolder 'cause
All of my pumping blood?
I am human, I am woman
Drifting down my life
Light up this time, light up this time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
