Song Name: Little Bit
Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of
But how we moved from A to B
It can't be up to me 'cause I don't know
Eye to eye, thigh to thigh
I let go
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me
And for you I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, you know I-I-I
I would do it, push a button
Pull the trigger, pull a mountain, jump off a cliff
'Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, and we could do it
It was you and I, not only I
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me
Think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me, oh
Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything
To have you as my man
Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything
To have you as my man
Little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit, little bit

Little bit
Little bit
Little bit
Little bit, little bit
