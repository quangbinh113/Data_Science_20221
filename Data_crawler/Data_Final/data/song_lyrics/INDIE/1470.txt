Song Name: Hold U
You are a good thing I've noticed, I've noticed
And I want a good thing with you
You are the best thing, and I've got it, I've got you
And I would do anything for you
And I will hold you, I will hold you, oh-oh
I will hold you, I will hold you
And I will hold you, I will hold you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
You are a good thing, I've noticed, I've seen it
And I want the best things for you
I am a good thing and I promise you got me
And I would go anywhere with you
And I will hold you, I will hold you, oh-oh
I will hold you, I will hold you
And I will hold you, I will hold you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I'm not the only body
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only body
I'm not the only one
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Hold me, hold me
And I will hold you, I will hold you, oh-oh
I will hold you, I will hold you
And I will hold you, I will hold you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
