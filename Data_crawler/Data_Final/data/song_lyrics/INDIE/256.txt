Song Name: So Good Looking
Remember when we used to be happy?
Then we grew up and we got busy
Oh, don't throw away yesterday
We don't have enough time to be wastin'
She said
"We're so good looking that we don't stand a chance
We're soakin' up the sun, but we don't get a tan
We don't give a damn"
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(So take a chance and stand by me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
You're so good looking that I don't stand a chance
You don't give a damn
Remember when we'd go night swimming
In your raggy clothes, that was your fashion
And then you'd talk away, all those words you'd say
Makes me miss you, I'm lost in this silence
You'd say
"We're so good looking that we don't stand a chance
We're soakin' up the sun, but we don't get a tan
We don't give a damn"
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(So take a chance and stand by me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
You're runnin' away from the words that you say
And runnin' and runnin' and runnin' away
You're runnin' away from the words that you say
We're so good looking that we don't stand a chance
We're soakin' up the sun, but we don't get a tan
We don't give a damn
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(So take a chance and stand by me)
I don't know if we're gonna make it
(You know that you can lean on me)
You're so good looking that I don't stand a chance
You don't give a damn
