Song Name: Talk to Me
You don't have to be a hero to save the world
It doesn't make you a narcissist to love yourself
It feels like nothing is easy, it'll never be
That's alright, let it out, talk to me
You don't have to be a prodigy to be unique
You don't have to know what to say or what to think
You don't have to be anybody you can never be
That's alright, let it out, talk to me
Anxiety, tossing, turning in your sleep
Even if you run away, you still see them in your dreams
It's so dark tonight, but you'll survive, certainly
It's alright, come inside, and talk to me


We can talk here on the floor
On the phone, if you prefer
I'll be here until you're okay
Let your words release your pain
You and I will share the weight
Growing stronger day by day
It's so dark outside tonight
Build a fire warm and bright
And the wind, it howls and bites
Bite it back with all your might
Anxiety, tossing, turning in your sleep
Even if you run away, you still see them in your dreams
It's so dark tonight, it looks nice, fall asleep
It's alright, come inside
And talk to me
