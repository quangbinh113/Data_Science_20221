Song Name: Your Life Your Time
You said I was lazy
And that might be true
But that doesn't mean
That I should drive three hours to you, oh
And now you reject the blame
And play insane
And now I want to just give you a call 'cause
Maybe you're just crazy
It's not my fault that I'm not enough, oh
I moved on before we broke up
'Cause you kept my mouth shut
When you said that I could make that call, oh
I grew up and I feel fine
You should try it sometime
But who am I to give you advice anymore?
Maybe I was crazy
To stay so long
For someone who wouldn't even let me go
'Cause everything was your life, your time
Your life, your time
'Cause everything was your life, your time
Your life, your time
