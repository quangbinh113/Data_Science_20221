Song Name: Home for the Summer
We started getting close
Freshman year, when all our friends were smoking cigarettes
And we couldn't stand that secondhand smoke
So we'd leave and drive around until you had to drop me off at home
Swear that was yesterday
But in two weeks I'd be moving South
And you'd be moving to a town that I had never heard of
I wish we had more time, why did I ever wanna grow up?
You said you'll see me when we are
Home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other
We'd wait till after dark
2:00 a.m., we're laying on the ground, in my backyard
I told you I'd be waiting there the night that I get back
I hope you don't forget about that
When we ae
Home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other
We'll have lives in two different suburbs
We'll have families with different lovers
But for now, I know I'll see you when we are
Home for the summer
I know
You've been busy
That's okay
I still can't wait to be
Home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other
We'll have lives in two different suburbs
We'll have families with different lovers
But for now, I know I'll see you when we are
Home for the summer
