Song Name: Tomorrow Is Yesterday
I'm just a rat spinning the wheels of dollar signs in their eyes
I'm just a battery, automatically sucking my life
When tomorrow is yesterday, today's just the same
I got friends on the carriage, but I don't know their names
And I think how did I get here, again and again
They say I'm alkaline, ever-ready for over time
I pop my adderal, collaterally stuck in my mind
When tomorrow is yesterday, today's just the same
I'm a candle that's burning, but I'm losing my flame
And I think how did I get here, again and again and again
You're not just a kid anymore
Got to think about tomorrow when it comes today
I just can't help thinking there's more
To my life, everyday I do it over again
You're not just a kid anymore
Got to think about tomorrow when it comes today
I just can't help thinking there's more
To my life, everyday I do it over again
When tomorrow is yesterday, today's just the same
I'm a candle that's burning, but I'm losing my flame
And I think how did I get here, again and again and again
You're not just a kid anymore
Got to think about tomorrow when it comes today
I just can't help thinking there's more
To my life, everyday I do it over again
You're not just a kid anymore
Got to think about tomorrow when it comes today
I just can't help thinking there's more
To my life, everyday I do it over again
