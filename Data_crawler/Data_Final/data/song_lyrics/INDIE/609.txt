Song Name: She's My Religion
Always lighting up every room
Seems so perfect from every point of view
Just one look is more than enough
Makes you believe in something above
But not everything's always as it seems
It's a different story laying beneath
She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
She's forever angry at the world
She's no angel, but she is my religion
Always finding ways to numb the pain
She's mad and she will never change
She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
Everybody wants to have their taste
I'm no different, I am just the same
But she helped me find a different kinda love
Made me feel like I was finally enough
But there's more going on behind the scenes
She needs this love just as much as me
She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
She's forever angry at the world
She's no angel, but she is my religion
Always finding ways to numb the pain
She's mad and she will never change
She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
Religion, religion
Religion, religion
Religion, religion
Religion, religion
She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
She's forever angry at the world
She's no angel, but she is my religion
Always finding ways to numb the pain
She's mad and she will never change
She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
