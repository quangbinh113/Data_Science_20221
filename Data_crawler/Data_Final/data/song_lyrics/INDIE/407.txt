Song Name: Affluenza
Mama's got a new man
And daddy's got a new mansion to keep
He never really calls back
'Cause he's got too many finances to reap
Money, money, ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money, give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody
All these kids have got affluenza
Goin' wreckin' their daddy's Benz, ah
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh, oh
They say, "Money can't buy you no love"
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluence, oh
Affluenza, affluenza
Everyday's your birthday
You threw a party but you kinda hate all your friends
So you're crying in the driveway
Killin' time, gettin' high, can't wait 'til it ends
Money, money, ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money, give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody
All these kids have got affluenza
Goin' wreckin' their daddy's Benz, ah
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh, oh
They say, "Money can't buy you no love"
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of affluence, oh
Affluenza, affluenza
Fat stacks, cold cash
You've always had it real lavish, first-class
Trust fund, gold tongue
80 grand in both your hands, but no love
All these kids have got affluenza
Goin' wreckin' their daddy's Benz, ah
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh, oh
They say, "Money can't buy you no love" (can't buy you no love)
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluence, oh
Affluenza, affluenza
