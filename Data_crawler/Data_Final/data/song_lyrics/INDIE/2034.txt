Song Name: Insomnia
(One, two, three, four)
Lately I'm dissatisfied
Paralyzed, I've tried it all
Hold me tight
Come home tonight
Say I'm the best
I know I don't deserve it
But I can't eat, baby
I can't sleep
And the only thing I can think about is you
And my heart is pounding
My lungs inflate
But I feel so dead
The moment that you leave
Guess that I've just never been
In love before
It freaks me out
Waking up, next to you
It feels too good to be true
Waking up (next)
Next to you
It feels too good (too)
To be true
Waking up (next)
Next too you
It feels too good (too)
To be true
I can't eat, baby
I can't sleep
And the only thing I can think about is you
And my heart is pounding
My lungs inflate
But I feel so dead
The moment that you leave
