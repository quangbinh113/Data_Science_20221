Song Name: Hypotheticals
And if I changed my hair and the way that I talk
And if I got new friends and I cut my mustache off
And I knew what to say when the conversation died
And I gave better compliments than "You look really nice"
And if I had more fans and if I made more cash
And I believed you when you'd say I look nice
And if I changed everything
Yeah, my whole fucking life
Would you please love me then?
Would you please love me then?
Would you please love me?
Please love me
Please love me
Please love me
Please love me
And if I got to see a therapist on time
Maybe I could write a message on first try
But I waste a whole day choosing "Hey" or "Hi" or "How you've been?" or "Is your day alright?"
And if I could stop with hypotheticals
Then this wouldn't be a hypothetical
But it is, and I can't
Truthfully
I'm tired of being me
It's just too exhausting
I'm such a crybaby
And tragically
There are no real problems
Now I have to create them
So there is a purpose to my worrying
I spent some time in the promised land
And I spent my love on those who didn't love me back
And you waited here but not for me
You were waiting just 'cause you felt like it
And I'm so confused
What is happening?
Are you staying here or are you leaving?
Say something
Say that you love me
Truthfully
I'm tired of being me
It's just too exhausting
I'm such a crybaby
And tragically
There are no real problems
Now I have to create them
So there is a purpose to my worrying
It's 8 o'clock and I just pressed "Send"
Now my text became some meaningless
Binary code, just some 1's and 0's
Until you gave it a meaning again
Truthfully
I'm tired of being me
It's just too exhausting
I'm such a crybaby
Tragically
There are no real problems
So I have to create them
So there is a purpose to my worrying
(A purpose to my worrying)
To my worrying
(A purpose to my worrying)
To my worrying, yeah
(A purpose to my worrying)
To my worrying
(A purpose to my worrying)
To my worrying
