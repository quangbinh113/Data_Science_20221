Song Name: A Song About Fishing
The mud in my fingers had dried to a crust
Sleep in my eyes, I pick my rust, my
Boots have been ravaged in browns and grays, I've
Seen no scale, and I've, seen no pay, but
Still I trudge to a spotless stream, not a
Not a bird in the sky or a fish in the sea
To dwell in these waters is a foolish way
To believe one night, that I'll win the day
And rise and shine, to dawn I wake, to
Cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
I sailed down stream to see what had, I
Pulled my boat along the land, I
Swam the dirt, and walked the stream and
Off the shore, I saw a bream and
Tuna too, and salmon roe
Do my eyes deceive, but my net had broke, I
Told my tale to a merchant man
He pittied me a dollar, and gave me his hand, he said
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake, to
Cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake, to
Cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake
