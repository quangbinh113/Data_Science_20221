Song Name: Buy the Stars
You bought a star in the sky tonight
Because your life is dark and it needs some light
You named it after me, but I'm not yours to keep
Because you'll never see, that the stars are free
Oh, we don't own our heavens now, we only own our hell
And if you don't know that by now then you don't know me that well
All my life I've been so lonely, all in the name of being holy
Still, you'd like to think you know me, you keep buyin' stars
And you could buy up all of the stars but it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are, it's just who you are
You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark, the light inside you died
Oh, we don't own our heavens now, we only own our hell
And if you don't know that by now then you don't know me that well
All my life I've been so lonely, all in the name of being holy
And still, you'd like to think you own me, you keep buying stars
And you could buy up all the stars but it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are, it's just who you are
You know only how to own me
You know only how to own me
You're buying stars to shut out the light
We come alone and alone we die
And no matter how hard you try
I'll always belong in the sky
And you could buy up all of the stars but it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are, it's just who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
