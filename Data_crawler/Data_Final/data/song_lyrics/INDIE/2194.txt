Song Name: Keep You Warm
We never got it right
We never got it wrong
All those nights we'd fight
We'd never let it go
Feel the rain pour down
Watch it tear through the light
Watch the clouds float by
And leave you cold in the night
And leave you cold in the night
We never got it right
We never got it wrong
All those nights we'd fight
We'd never let it go
Feel the rain pour down
Watch it tear through the light
Watch the clouds float by
And leave you cold in the night
And leave you cold in the night
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
You'll be alright I'll keep you warm
