Song Name: Heartbreak
Take your time to come my way I can see what I've been missing
I will live in fantasy where I never have to listen
Do you explain how I'm doing wrong and I'm simply not enough
Probably not what you even said but this
Heartbreak's gone this heartbreak's gone to my head
I'm feeling fine almost every day
Except for all the time, all the time
Don't have enough energy to even go
Outside, go outside (and cry anymore)
I've dropped my insecurities I left my dignity on the floor
But you'll pick it up again for me or will there never be a once more
I feel like on fire, you will sit back and smile
To lend me my brain when I'm running the show
I've given up
I've really really given up
But it's just to get to you
Oh this feels like
I feel like on fire, you will sit back and smile
To lend me my brain when I'm running the show
