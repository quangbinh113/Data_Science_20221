Song Name: Once Twice Melody
Out in the summer sun
She was the only one
Days go by, in her eyes
Belle de jour in front of me
No matter where you go
There'll always be your shadow
Lalala, days go by, lalala, in her eyes
Once, twice, melody
The purple on the vine
The velveteen tree line
Nights fly by, in her mind
All along the boulevard
She tries to understand
A never never land
Lalala, across thе room, lalala, sweet perfume
The sun, thе moon, the raindrops too
Ba da da da da, ba da da da daaaa
Lalala, days go by, lalala, in her eyes
Once, twice, melody
Ba da da da da, ba da da da daaaa
Lalala, days go by, lalala, in her eyes
Once, twice, melody
