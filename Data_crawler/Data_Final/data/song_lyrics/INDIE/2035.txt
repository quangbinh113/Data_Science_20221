Song Name: Humbug Mountain Song
The first time I realized I was living in this world
I was probably looking at the sky
And forgive me but I don't know if I remember enough to say
What the air was really like that day
May have been clouds
Or sun
I don't recall
I was young
And the next time I realized I was breathing in the life
Was the first time that I saw your face
I wanted you but I don't know
If I was brave enough to say
How the sight of you messed up my mind
I got scared, right away, and okay, right away
The next thing I knew the stars were eyes up in the night
And the ocean breathing heavy like a beast
I held you but I don't know
If I was strong enough to say
How the way it felt messed up my mind
May have been clouds
Or sun
I don't recall
I was young
May have been clouds
Or sun
I don't recall
I was young
May have been clouds
Or sun
I don't recall
I was young
May have been clouds
Or sun
I don't recall
I was young
