Song Name: Bones (God Like You)
Broke my bones again
Slow to healing
Always in the same place
Back into that wrist brace
No good in an arms race
I know my weakness but that don't stop you from gunning at it
Should I redeem it when I'm running with my bad habits?
You're always at my heels and now I'm kneeling at yours too
Oh, to be a god like you, you
Muddied thoughts again
We make shitty friends
Stood up on a weak chair
Finding out if I care
Nothing left to compare
I know my weakness but that don't stop you from gunning at it
Should I redeem it when I'm running with my bad habits?
You're always at my heels and now I'm kneeling at yours too
Oh, to be a god like you, you (you, you)
Slow to healing (oh, my bones)
