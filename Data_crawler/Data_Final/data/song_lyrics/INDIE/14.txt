Song Name: Are You Bored Yet? (feat. Clairo)
What's wrong, you've been askin'
But I don't have an answer
How come, I'm still thinkin'
Let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far
When you've got a head start
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie

Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie
Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're goin'
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feelin'
Maybe we could get through this undefeated
Holdin' on for so long, oh
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie
