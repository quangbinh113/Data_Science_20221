Song Name: Fell In Love With a Girl
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah"
"Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating now"
Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor and the eyes for peepin'
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all my love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
Said it once before but it bears repeating now
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all my love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, well
Said it once before but it bears repeating now
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah"
"Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating now"
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all my love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, well
I said it once before but it bears repeating now
