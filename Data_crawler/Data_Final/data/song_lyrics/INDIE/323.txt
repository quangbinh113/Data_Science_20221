Song Name: Young & Dumb
Wearing black lipstick, bleaching your hair blonde
Put on your socks, cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs and
Your I Love New York shirt
Well I know full well that you are the patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well so am I
You wanna go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat you
Showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat, oh baby
My heart is racing watching you kissing on my guitar
Faking a tear drop by spraying my eye with that water gun...
Well I know full well that you are the patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well so am I
We wanna go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on...
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat you
Showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat, oh baby
