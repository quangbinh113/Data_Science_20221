Song Name: Romeo & Juliet
Someday, down the road, I hope to be your Romeo
I'll climb the wires to your landline
While you're crying on the telephone
And you're sitting, feet dangling
Cheeks so rosy red and saying
"Baby, I was so upset, I thought you'd never set me free"
"Hello?"
I'd say, "Oh, I love you" to my Juliet
If you only knew, I'd kill for you, I am for you
I am just who you need me to be
Let's get down, and let's grow old
This fire escape is getting cold
I love that dress, I love the rest
Of all that you've got going on
One day when the lines have all been read and memorized
I hope you mean it when you say that
I am yours and you are mine
Singing down here, on my knees
I'm begging, "Won't you marry me?"
I love that dress, I love the rest
So Julie make me go, go on
But how do you know?
Is it just something hits you?
Yes (look, just do a bit for me)
No (no, I don't, I don't mean it, I don't mean it)
I mean just the words
Um (no, my babe, it's done so many times)
Oh for goodness sake
Alright do another bit, any bit
Um...
Oh God I have nothing to fucking sing
