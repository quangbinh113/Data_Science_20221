Song Name: Empty Head
Empty head
It's cool to have nothin' in it
It's okay not to sing a song
About everything
All the time
But if I did (if I did)
I'd fill up all the server farms (server farms)
I'd fill up all the iPhone clouds (iPhone clouds)
I'd fill up all the hard drives
So, I should keep an empty head (empty head)
Fill myself up with emptiness (emptiness)
And try to just take a breath (take a breath)
Sometimes
I'm always bursting at the seams
I'll tell you all about my dreams
I wish that I could quiet it
Accept a little silence
Maybe one day I'll find it
And I'll toe the line
I pick you like a coffee cup (coffee cup)
You thought that I could pick you up (pick you up)
But I don't even have a car (have a car)
I'm taking you right where we are
I'm at the bottom of the road (of the road)
You're looking like the line I toed (line I toed)
You're at me like an antelope (antelope)
I'm swaying like a grassy knoll
It's the first time I spoke today
And that's why when you heard me say
Hello I sounded like a frog
I thought that I could pet the dog
But it just wasn't up to me
I hid behind the neighbors tree
But he wouldn't come out to play
I guess I'll try another day
It's all to keep an empty head
It's cool to have nothin' in it
It's okay not to sing a song
About everything
All the time
