Song Name: I Saw the Moon
Slideshow
Palisades and someone's face in the window
On the train with coffee stains in my new clothes
I can taste the trace of grapes with my eyes closed
Playing catch with our mouths to the sound of the sirens
I got so mad that I thought I was dying
We got along like a house that's on fire
I've just been sparking the lighter
I don't think it's weak if I feel something new
Because I saw the moon in the mid-afternoon
You know, who even cares 'bout what I'm supposed to do?
I forgive you
Okay
Wiping off the kisses you left on my face
God, I hate you even more on your birthday
Why'd you only ever call when it's too late?
Playing tag with our mouths to the sound of you trying
And I got so mad that I thought I was dying
We got along like a house that's on fire
I've just been sparking the lighter
I don't think it's weak if I feel something new
Because I saw the moon in the mid-afternoon
Who even cares 'bout what l'm supposed to do?
I forgive you
