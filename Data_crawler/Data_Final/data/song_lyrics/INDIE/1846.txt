Song Name: Human Condition
Sally's feelings got lost in a feeling
And she said the thing she didn't mean to say
And Johnny said what he wanted to say
But he looked away with every single word
Just to hurt you back
Whether they knew
Call it crazy it's true
Went on and on and on it goes
It's the human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned the eyes
Nobody mentioned the eyes
Bennys the youngest of all of the brothers
And the only one that ever got away
Katja left when she turned sixteen
And she's not turning back for anything
Just to hurt you back
Whether they knew
Call it crazy it's true
Went on and on and on it goes
It's the human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned
The eyes the eyes the eyes the eyes
Human condition
But nobody mentioned the eyes
Nobody mentioned the eyes
