Song Name: Like You
You gotta get up
You gotta get up and make a move
'Cause the world won't ever see you 'til you do
No, they don't really care what you're going through
So, you gotta show 'em, baby
You gotta show 'em the real you
You gotta give 'em what you've got
No, don't let them see what you're not
'Cause you are strong
You are wise
You are worth beyond a thousand reasons why
And you can't be perfect, baby
'Cause nobody's perfect, darling
But no, no, no, no, there's nobody in the world
Like you
What do you do when you can't let go?
What do you say
When you just don't know how you feel?
And you know nobody knows how you feel
'Cause everybody's got their own damn problems
So everybody's tryna find their way
And day-by-day is a struggle
In this world, you know you have to hustle
Just know, that you're not alone
You don't always have to be strong, all by yourself (By yourself)
I said it's okay to ask for help
Now listen
People will find you, but they don't define you
And you will find people, who help redesign you
People will find you, but they don't define you
And you will find people, who help redesign you
You are a work of art
Bet you didn't think you'd come this far
Now, here you are
Baby, you are strong
You are wise
You are worth beyond a thousand reasons why
And you can't be perfect, baby
'Cause nobody's perfect, darling
But no, no, no, no, there's nobody in the world
Like you (You know you love you)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like you)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
You know you're worth it
'Cause you know that you can't be perfect, baby
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
'Cause nobody's perfect, darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like you)
I love you just the way that you are
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
I love you just the way that you are
My love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
It's like stars in the sky
Oh, when you look in my eyes
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Like, like)
