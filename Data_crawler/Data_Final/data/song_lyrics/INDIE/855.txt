Song Name: How Do I Lose You
I didn't know that I was falling 'til I hit the ground
And was it love if you can never hear it make a sound?
'Cause if you said we're losing time, I would've made it count
But look at us now, Mmm-mmm
And I hold on tight
To what's not mine
Can't we decide what to call it?
So how do I lose you if I never had you?
Loving you like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing here to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I lose you?
I didn't notice that I missed you 'til the hurricane
Remember islands on the pavement, and the pouring rain
We stood together, it's like I'm tethered 'til the weather
Now it's not the same, mmm-hmm-mmm
And I hold on tight
To what's not mine
Can't we decide, should we call it?
Oh, how do I lose you if I never had you?
Loving you like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing here to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I?
Keep on hearing something
When we both said nothing?
What's the point in bluffing
From a hundred miles away?
So how did I lose you if I never had you?
Loving like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing here to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I lose you?
Oh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm-mm
Oh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
