Song Name: dream girl
Lost in my thoughts, I don't know what to do
Alone in my room thinking of you again
Baby girl I cannot sit and pretend
Yeah, I do not want to be more than friend
Sleeping at night, and I'm dreaming of you
I've never seen something more beautiful
Baby you got me all up in a trance
Girl come walk with me, and please hold my hand
Holding you kissing while we in the rain
Give me your heart, let me heal of your pain
If I got the chance, I'd give anything
If I got the chance, I'd give anything
All of these feelings you never would know
'Cause I'm too afraid to go and show
Hold on tight, never let go
Hold on tight, never let go
