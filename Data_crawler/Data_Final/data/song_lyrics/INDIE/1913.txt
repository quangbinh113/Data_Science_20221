Song Name: Can't Love Myself
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you?
I can't love myself
Each day I wake
I wish I'm someone else
