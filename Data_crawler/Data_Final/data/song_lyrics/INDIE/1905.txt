Song Name: Dreams of Losing Teeth
(Trying to find myself) Desperately I woke up last night to my
Dreams of losing teeth
Got up this morning with tears in bed
I had a dream of when you said
"I'll always be in your corner"
Well, you know I'll do the same for you
As you turned away
My jaw gave into agony
Tearing roots through apathy
What the fuck happened to me?
We're caught up in this circumstance
It hurts to love with disconnect
I don't wanna let you go
As new cuspids start to grow
Desperately I woke up last night to my
Dreams of losing teeth
What it means? I don't know
But sorry, I don't have the lifetime warranty
(Trying to find myself) Desperately I woke up last night to my
Dreams of losing teeth
(I'll be in your corner) What it means? I don't know
But sorry, I don't have the lifetime warranty
Trying to find myself
I'll be in your corner
