Song Name: down
Two a.m, you're stuck again
Don't know how to feel
Burning through the summer blues
Just wishing you could heal
You wanna fight
But you don't know how
Just hold on tight
You're closer than you know
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way
Just give it time
You're gonna show them all
Just how brave you are
If you need someone to call, I'll be around
And I won't let you down
Won't let you down, down, down
Won't let you down, down, down
Won't let you down, down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
I see the pain behind your eyes
It's crippled me before
I know it's dark, you're terrified
You can't get off the floor
You wanna fight
But you don't know how
Just hold on tight
You're closer than you know
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way
Just givе it time
You're gonna show them all
Just how bravе you are
If you need someone to call, I'll be around
And I won't let you down
Won't let you down, down, down
Won't let you down, down, down (Down)
Won't let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down (I won't let you down)
Won't let you down, down, down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down, down, down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down, down
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way
Just give it time
You're gonna show them all
Just how brave you are
If you need someone to call I'll be around
And I won't let you down
