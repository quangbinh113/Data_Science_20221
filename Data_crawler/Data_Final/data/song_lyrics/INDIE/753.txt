Song Name: Not That Girl
Take off my clothes and it's me underneath them
This is full time not just me on the weekend
Tell me my words you don't like, I'll repeat them
I'll repeat them
Walk in the room, there it is, it's that look again
Like who the fuck is this bitch, what she thinking and
What is that shoes, top and skirt combination
That shoes, top and skirt combination
I'm really sorry that I'm not the girl
Who would give the world just to be your girl
It's kinda funny that you're on your own
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
I'm really sorry if my dirty tights
Make you think that you're gonna score tonight
It's kinda funny that you're on your own
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
Don't you think you would look nicer with brown hair
When you have children they'll sit in their high chair
Look at their mummy and see the disaster
Don't you forget that appearances matter
Walk in the room, no surprise, it's that look again
Like who the fuck is this bitch, what she thinking and
What is that shoes, top and skirt combination
That shoes, top and skirt combination
I'm really sorry that I'm not the girl
Who would give the world just to be your girl
It's kinda funny that you're on your own
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
I'm really sorry if my dirty tights
Make you think that you're gonna score tonight
It's kinda funny that you're on your own
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
I'm really sorry that I'm not the girl
Who would give the world just to be your girl
It's kinda funny that you're on your own
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
It's kinda funny that you're even asking me
Ha, could you say that again?
'Cause, it's kind of funny that you're even asking me
