Song Name: I Threw Glass at My Friend's Eyes and Now I'm on Probation
You're ruining my life day by day
The butterflies you give me are literally making me nauseous
This is disgusting, like seriously dude
What do you think you're doing?
You're like way older than me
And you're gross and I don't wanna do that
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hangout with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But fuck you!
You're so old, dude!
Like seriously, what do you think you're doing?
Your hands are so big and you're so tall, wow!
You know, I kinda wish I had let you do that one thing that one time
But in retrospect, it would've been a bad idea 'cause
You don't care about me like I care about you so I feel bad
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hangout with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm really ironically pissed off right now
I'm feeling quite lost right now
Like in a really big forest like in lake tahoe or something
Somewhere big and scary
'Cause you're scary as shit, dude!
Like I don't know really know what I can tell you
You kinda freak me out, but we can be friends
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hangout with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna make out with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hangout with you
