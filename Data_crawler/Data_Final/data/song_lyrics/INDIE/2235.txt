Song Name: Heaven
I came to see your presence
Didn't realize what I got into
I failed to heed the message
I opened up my eyes to a different view
They say the word becomes the weapon
How do you recognize the pain in you?
I lost my way to heaven
A new state of mind that I fell into
There's a new day on the rise
And I'm comin' back to life
Concede my imperfections
I feel a desire that is cutting through
Sustain my own direction
Commit to the fire that they burn in you
They say the word becomes the message
Do you recognize the blame in you?
I found my way to heaven
A new way of life that I'm living through
There's a new day on the rise
And I'm comin' back to life
Paint me the picture
Follow my plan
Tracing the lines on the palm of your hand
Anything goes in the promised land
Take what you want to while you can
Paint me the picture
Follow my plan
Tracing the lines on the palm of your hand
Anything goes in the promised land
Take what you want to while you can
Paint me the picture
Follow my plan
Tracing the lines on the palm of your hand
Anything goes in the promised land
Take what you want to while you can
