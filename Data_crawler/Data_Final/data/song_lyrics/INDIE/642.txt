Song Name: Sad Songs In The Summer
Sad songs in the summer
Heartbreak through the stereo
Find ways to recover
But it's hard tryna let you go
Sad songs in the summer
The sun's out but I sit at home
Hold on to a lover
Because it's hard tryna let you go, go
Tryna let you go, go
I can't listen to Tame Impala
I can't look at my phone 'cause I'll call ya
Now I gotta cover all my favorite tattoos
Because they remind me of you
And I can't listen to old Nirvana
Won't even think about drinking vodka
I swear to god that everything I do
It all reminds me of you
It all reminds me of you
Sad songs in the summer
Heartbreak driving down your road
I'll find me another
But it won't be the antidote (sad songs)
Sad songs in the summer
I should be out but I'm all alone
Keep it all buried under
'Cause it's hard tryna let you go
I can't listen to Tame Impala
I can't look at my phone 'cause I'll call ya
Now I gotta cover all my favorite tattoos
Because they remind me of you
And I can't listen to old Nirvana
Won't even think about drinking vodka
I swear to god that everything I do
It all reminds me of you
It all reminds me of you
It all reminds me of you, oh
Go (sad songs in the summer)
Go
