Song Name: New York, Paris and London
No, no, no, no, no
I hold you in
I'd love to know that you care
Already in too deep
It's weighing on my mind
I'd love to know that you care
I'm waiting on my SOS
I'm waiting on my ideas
Do you like it, do you like it
Do you like me now?
You hold me
You never let me go again
Tried so many times, it's hard living on the inside
I want to be young again, young again, I'm young again, I'm young again
So let me live my lie
Oh let me live my lie
Oh the rest of my life, I'll spend it all with you tonight
You never need to know, if you try your best
I'd love to know that you care
Already in too deep
It's weighing on my mind
I'd love to know that you care
I'm waiting on my SOS
I'm waiting on my ideas
Do you like it, do you like it
Do you like me now?
Hold me
And never let me go again
I've tried so many times, it's hard living on the inside
I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again
Ah, you hold me
New York, Paris, and London
With a man who tried living on the inside
I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again
Oh let me live my lie
Oh let me live my lie
Oh the rest of my life, I'll spend it all with you tonight
