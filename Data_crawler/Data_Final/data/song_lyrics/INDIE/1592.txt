Song Name: I Can't Handle Change
Hangin' out where I don't belong is nothing new to me
I get tired, and I get sick, and then I lose the strength to leave
I can't handle change
I can't handle change
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I can't help but repeat myself
I know it's not your fault
Still lately, I begin to shake
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
