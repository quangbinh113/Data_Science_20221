Song Name: Song For Survival
It's Not For Us To Say
What Will Be
And At The End Of The Day
We'll See
Which Way The Whole Things Bends
And What It Could Bring
'Cuz Nothing Really Matters
'Cept The Little Things
Some Say It Works Like This
Maybe It's True
But The Truth Can Lies Sometimes
That's Faith For You
Let The Preachers Talk
And We Could Sing
The Song For Survival
Make Sure It Swings
We're Not Perfect
We're Not Slick
We Don't Steals
Just Like Thieves
We Are Thick
We Walk Our Talk And We Sing
The Song For Survival
Make Sure It Swings
It's Not For Us To Say
What Will Be
And At The End Of The Day
We'll See
Which Way The Whole Things Bends
And What It Could Bring
'Cuz Nothing Really Matters
If We Could Swing
With The Little Things"
