Song Name: i'd rather be alone
What you said to me
I hope you mean it, too
'Cause my head's a mess
I don't know what to do
So I'd rather be alone
I wish you well
I'll keep to myself
You played me for a fool
Mama said
"Be careful with your heart
They'll get the one
And leave you out to rot"
So I'd rather be alone
I wish you well
I'll keep to myself
'Cause you played me for a fool
