Song Name: Walk in the Dark
Every once in a while
I feel home for once in a while
Take my dinner on the porch
Mind is clean, though my clothes are worn
And I still like to walk in the dark
And I don't mind not knowing what you are
Stop
Stop
Every once in a while
I feel home for once in a while
And I don't fear
And I don't fear
And I don't fear
And I don't fear
Tell me, do you ever wanna stay like this forever?
Waste the current of our hours
Just because the current's ours
We could feel the fall of autumn
Watch the leaves grow soft and solemn
While the waves are getting thicker
Feel the light give way to flicker
Drown it all
You won't
Drown it all
You won't
Drown it all
You won't (I)
Still like to walk in the dark
And I don't mind not knowing what you are
