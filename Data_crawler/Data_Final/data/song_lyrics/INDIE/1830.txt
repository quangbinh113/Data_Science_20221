Song Name: say goodbye
I'm sick of singing 'bout depression
On the same old chord progression
I'd be a-okay if I could be how you see me
But F it
And I can't wait 'til I've ascended
To those pearly gates in Heaven
If they take one look at my punk ass, just forget it
I won't get in 'cause
Yeah, I think life has passed me by
You can say goodbye
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (one, two, three, four)
I sleep myself into a coma
On this whiskey scented sofa
Strum away my days instead of trying to go for
My diploma, so
I tell myself that I'm an artist
It's how I wish to be regarded
It's a full time job being a fucking fraud and that's where my hеart is
'Cause my whole life has passеd me by
You can say goodbye
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
