Song Name: Pretty
Drink a dirty puddle
It's a pretty puzzle
Everything, everything
Falls into place
Gravedigger, dirt lifter
Don't litter or it hurts
Dust fire, pink marker
Villainous, James Harden
What's so funny? I don't know
What's so funny?
Even from my good side, I don't look right
I hate where my mind goes half of the time
Guess we all get older, I don't want to be here if you're not
"I'll remember you"
You said
Tough talk, but I'm nice
I've lived a lot of lives
Linked up, chain fence
I've been on my way to the deep end
I don't wanna waste my time
You don't need to save my life
What's so funny? I don't know
Even from my good side, I don't look right
I hate where my mind goes half of the time
Guess we all get older, I don't want to be here if you're not
"I'll remember you"
You said
You said
You said
You said
