Song Name: Anything But Me
You're gonna say that I'm on a high horse
I think that my horse is regular-sized
Did you ever think maybe
You're on a pony
Going in circles on a carousel ride?
You're gonna say I asked for the moon, I
Think it was you with your head in the sky
All that I wanted was somebody honest
Living for more than their next good time
You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets, you can call me if
There's anything you need
Anything, anything but
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me
Go ahead and hate me as long as you need to
Go ahead and break me a piece of your mind
Say I always had one foot out
Baby, I got two now
Good thing I've never been afraid of goodbye
You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets, you can call me if
There's anything you need
Anything, anything but
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me
And sure, it's not all so black and white
Sure, I'm gonna cry
For the love we couldn't keep
But I would rather lose you
Than who I'm meant to be
So you can have anything but
Me...
(Me) you can have anything but
Me, me, yeah-yeah
(Anything you need) you can have anything but me (me)
You can gave anything but me
