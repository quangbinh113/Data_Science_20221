Song Name: Ways to Go
I'm brushing my hair
I'm changing my clothes
And all this time I'm thinking of
Ways to go
I woke up yesterday
And I'm ready tomorow
But all this time I'm thinking of ways to go
Ways to go
I smile a little
My teeth may show
And I'm not saying it
But I'm thinking of ways to go
I laugh a bit louder
Just so you never know
That all this time I'm thinking of
Ways to go
Ways to go
I'll love you forever
And always though
When I'm with you I still think of ways to go
I don't think I can do this
But I hope
There's only a little more
Ways to go
Ways to go
