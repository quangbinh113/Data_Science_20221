Song Name: Blue Sheen
I let it sink
Unsighted plight, aw, yeah
I said it
I do this all the time
I know it
I know it's fake
(Tell me what) what will it take?
To do this all again
You should have stayed back
I should have saved that
You shouldn't say that
I should've stayed back
Paint my face
Draw the lips
Blue sheen
On my eyelids
Late talk on the phone
Said you wanted me
But I know you don't
I know you really don't
I should have stayed back
You should have saved that
I shouldn't say that
You should've stayed back
