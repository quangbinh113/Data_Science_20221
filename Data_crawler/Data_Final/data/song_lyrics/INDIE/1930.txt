Song Name: Money
Before I die
I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand and I'll take you for a ride
You hit me yesterday
Because I made you cry
So before we die, I'd like to do something nice
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
And if I had a car
I would trade in my car
If I had a gun, I would trade in my gun
Honey we ran from the country
When we rushed to the city
And now there's nothing to be done, there's nothing to be done
There's nothing to be done, there's nothing to be done
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
And I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
And I want to buy you something (But I don't have any money)
(No, I don't have any money)
