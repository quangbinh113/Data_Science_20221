Song Name: Polly
Polly will you ever notice me
Sinking in the middle of your sea
Water in my ears
A wavy melody
I will hold my breath eternally
Fraticapatica automatica
I don't slow down I don't slow down
I won't grow up
I hit ground ground runnin' runnin' amok
Imma rip my face off and Imma dance for you
Lookin' at the feeling of an empty room
I wanna do everything that a god would do
So I'm invinci-
Bull in the ring
Let the red flag billow
Below me is a city you can call me Godzilla
Cross the road little chicken
Wanna stomp upon a bully 'cause
I'm invincible
Yo, did I tell you?
What?
Oh?
Polly will you ever turn around
Followin' your footprints on the ground
Callin' for you but you never hear a sound
I don't wanna lose the love I found
Jiminy Cricket lickety split
I don't slow down I don't slow down
I won't grow up
I hit the ground ground runnin runnin amok
Imma rip my face off and Imma dance for you
Lookin' at the feeling of an empty room
I wanna do everything that a god would do
So I'm invinci-
Bull in the ring
Let the red flag billow
Below me is a city you can call me Godzilla
Cross the road little chicken
Wanna stomp upon a bully cause
I'm invincible
