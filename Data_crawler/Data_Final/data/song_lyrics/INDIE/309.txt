Song Name: Together
In our way stands nothing
We can do this together
Running out in the streets
We need no looking after
But I don't see where we fit in
The misfits of a lost generation
Chasing dreams of different things
But we're still mates and that's a good feeling
I didn't know that you never knew
It's the time together
That we spend
That makes us such good friends
I'll be there till the end
I'll be there till the end
We don't have to see eachother everyday
We're like family we should stay, should stay together
I don't need no reassurance of this
And that's a good feeling
We're best mates, that's just how it is
And you best believe it
I didn't know that you never knew
It's the time together
That we spend
That makes us such good friends
I'll be there till the end
I'll be there till the end
It's a time you won't see me again
But I'll still be there my friend
It's a time you won't see
But I can only try to pretend I know how you're feeling
You know I'll still be...
Oh it's the time together
That we spend
That makes us such good friends
I'll be there till the end
Oh I'll be there till the end
