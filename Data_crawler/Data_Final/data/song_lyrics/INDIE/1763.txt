Song Name: strawberry chainsaw
No space big enough for how I feel
I'd show you with my hands if I could, dear
'Cause I love you more than I could love myself
Mama said don't fall in love again
She remembers all that I forget
Yeah, I try so hard I can't outrun myself, oh
Strawberry chainsaw, you're the treat
One day, you're harsh, and then you're sweet
And that's okay, that's fine with me
No woman ever could compete it
Best believe it
They can try, but I don't want someone else
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one

No place big enough for how I feel
My worst fear is the one when you're not near
'Cause I love you more than I could love myself
Mama said don't fall in love again
She remembers all that I forget
Yeah, I try so hard, I can't outrun myself, oh
Strawberry chainsaw, you're the treat
One day, you're harsh, and then you're sweet
And that's okay, that's fine with me
No woman ever could compete it
Best believe it
They can try, but I don't want someone else
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one
Strawberry chainsaw, you're the treat
One day, you're harsh, and then you're sweet
And that's okay, that's fine with me
No woman ever could compete it
Best believe it
They can try, but I don't want someone else
'Cause I'm more than sure you're the one
