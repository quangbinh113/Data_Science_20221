Song Name: i want to die in your arms
I haven't seen you in a while
It's been so long since I've seen you smile
Is it because I'm gone all the time
Or do you just not give a fuck, girl
I wanna die in your arms
I wanna die in the snow
I wanna die when I'm sad
So i'm not scared to go
I don't know if I can be happy
Without you by my side
Is it because I'm drunk all the time
Or do you just fuckin hate me girl
I wanna die in your arms
I wanna die in the snow
I wanna die when I'm sad
So i'm not scared to go
