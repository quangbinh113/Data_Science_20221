Song Name: Natural
Be honest, I could use a little help from someone else
Don't be, don't be that way with me
Don't be that way with me
Fingers crossed that I can trust a stranger here
A stranger there, but baby
Don't be that way with me
Don't be that way with me
She walks me through my life
She tells me what I'm tryna fight
Know I need to be anxious, baby, it's natural
She talks me through hard times
She tells me all my faults and I
Know I need to be angry, baby, it's natural
Now I'm just tryna put myself out there
It's hard when she's not there
I tell her all the time
I tell her all the time
I should be celebratin', but it's too devastatin'
I want her all the time
I want her all the time
She walks me through my life
She tells me what I'm tryna fight
Know I need to be anxious, baby, it's natural
She talks me through hard times
She tells me all my faults and I
Know I need to be angry, baby, it's natural
