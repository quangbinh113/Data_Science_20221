Song Name: Devil in My Head
Woke up
Hopped out of bed
Didn't recognize who was in my head
Thought I had lost my mind
The smallest of difference
I could tell over time
He likes all the same things
But he wants to die
Or live in the rain
Do you think I'm crazy?
Do you think I'm paranoid?
Do you think I would make this up to talk some noise?
Went out
Looked for a smoke
Kind of confused
He told me too where to go
Jumped out in front of car
But I was too fast
He didn't get very far
I cried, 'Why do I hurt?'
I realize it was me
Just was in a different shirt
Yeah I know I'm crazy
Yeah I know I'm paranoid
But I wouldn't make this up
To talk some noise
