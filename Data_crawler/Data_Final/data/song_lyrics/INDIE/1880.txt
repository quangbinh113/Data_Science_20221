Song Name: PIERCED ARROWS
Trying to avoid running into my ex on Broadway
No one recognizes me anymore, girl, I'm lonely
Vampires and thieves, someone will bleed
Will it be me?
Rich kids who wanted everything
Holding the bow while my ears ring
I keep on running for the blue
I duck my head and travel to
I keep on running for the blue
I duck my head and travel through
Pierced arrows from the sky
Fall through me everytime
Hey, that's no way to die
Can't hide from turpentine
Pierced arrows from the sky
Can't chase me down to size
I'm not afraid to cry
Can't hide from turpentine
This was the place that fell apart
You were the one to break it
I don't believe in anything
This whole fucking world is changing
I keep on running for the blue
I duck my head and travel through
Pierced arrows from the sky
Fall through me everytime
Hey, that's no way to die
Can't hide from turpentine
Pierced arrows from the sky
Can't chase me down to size
I'm not afraid to cry
Can't hide from turpentine
Pierced arrows from the sky
Fall through me everytime
Hey, that's no way to die
Can't hide from turpentine
Pierced arrows from the sky
Can't chase me down to size
I'm not afraid to cry
Can't hide from turpentine
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
