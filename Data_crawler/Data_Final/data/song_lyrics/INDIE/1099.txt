Song Name: Love Me Back (Fayahh Beat)
Alright, why'd she gotta lie straight to my face?
Tell me you want me and then don't stay
If you gon' walk, then walk my way
But I can't watch from just one place
You don't make it easy to leave, baby
Baby, you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease, baby (oh, oh, ah)
You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin', girl
And then you run away (ah, ooh)
Do you love me back?
Alright, if you gon' ask, then yeah, I'm fine
You didn't do nothin', just waste my time
If anyone asks, I'll say I tried
When we both know, you're stealing my line
You don't make it easy to leave, baby
Baby, you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease, baby (oh, oh, ah)
You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin' girl
And then you run away (ah, ooh)
Do you love me back? (Love me back)
Alright, why'd she gotta lie straight to my face?
Tell me you want me and then don't stay
If you gon 'walk, then walk my way
But I can't watch from just one place
You don't make it easy to leave me
Baby, you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease (tease me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin' girl
And then you run away (ah ooh)
Do you love me back?
