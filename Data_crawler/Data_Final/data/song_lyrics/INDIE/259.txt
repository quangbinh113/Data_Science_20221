Song Name: Hit Me Up
Said, I've got some time, I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up
Pretty boy, pretty boy, not a city guy
I ain't in the mix, I don't wanna feel
Fill you up, fill you up, put your head down
By my headphones, I don't get it but
Pullin' up, pullin' up in my car
All my friends, comin' down
Say you won't, say you won't ride with me, yeah
Said, I've got some time, I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up
You know I wouldn't tell you where to go
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bending corners like we're running from the sun up
Whip is turning different colors and you're takin' on changes
Wish I could see you, come around and fill you up
Waited for you, baby, but you stood me up
Breaking what you gave me, wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough
Wish I could see you, come around
Like one more time
Faded, like dumb it down
Over purchased like summertime
Baby, let's double down
I bet that you'll fuck with me now
Said, I've got some time, I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up
