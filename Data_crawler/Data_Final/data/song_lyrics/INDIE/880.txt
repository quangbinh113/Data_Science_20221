Song Name: We Haven't Looked at Our Phones
You moved to L.A. from Dallas, it's crazy
I grew up so close to you, I wonder if maybe
We crossed paths on a highway late at night
Did you wanna be in movies back when you were younger?
I love it here too but I really miss the thunder
Talking to you kinda makes me wonder
If you
See what I'm seeing
Feel what I'm feeling
'Cause, baby, I just noticed that
We haven't looked at our phones
I don't know where we are, we keep walking
I hope you don't want me to go
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, it's a quarter past two
Know I should look away but look at you
Don't know what you want me to do
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Fine, I'll play a song if you're really gonna make me
This one's brand new and I think it's called amazing
Don't tell me if you hate it
I'm picking up
The pieces of you in the stories you tell me
I'm tryna play it cool but it's kind of overwhelming
It's too early to tell, it's too early to tell, but
We haven't looked at our phones
I don't know where we are, we keep walking
I hope you don't want me to go
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, it's a quarter past two
Know I should look away but look at you
Don't know what you want me to do
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Do you see what I'm seeing?
Feel what I'm feeling?
'Cause baby, I just noticed that
Yeah
We haven't looked at our phones
I don't know where we are, we keep walking
I hope you don't want me to go
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, it's a quarter past two
Know I should look away but look at you
Don't know what you want me to do
'Cause I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
Yeah, I could drive you home, or we could keep it going
