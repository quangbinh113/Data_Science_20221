Song Name: Love Is More
You and me
We're not meant to be in love, but
I can only see
You in everything I'm dreaming
You and me
We're not even meant to meet, but
I can't help but see
You in everything, ah-ha
Walking in the rain
Talking on the phone
Driving in my car
Wonder if you're home
Read you in a book
Saw you in the show
Heard you in my song
Wonder if you're home
Love is more
Love is much more than a beautiful feeling
Love is more
Love is much more, it's so much more
Walking in the rain
Talking on the phone
He's jealous of my friends
Something feels wrong
Driving dangerous
So I will feel scared
I'm up against a wall
He's bashing in his head
Love is more
Love is much more than a beautiful feeling
Love is not
Love is not just a feeling to us
Love is more
Love is much more than a beautiful feeling
Love is
Love is much more, it's so much more
Than how I make you feel
It's more than this, I'm sure
More than all the excuses you gave and
More to want
You and me
We're not meant to be in love, but
I can only see
You in everything I'm dreaming
Walking in the rain
Talking on the phone
Driving in my car
Wonder if you're home
Read you in a book
Saw you at the show
Heard you in my song
Wonder if you're home
Love is more
Love is much more than a beautiful feeling
Love is not
Love is not just a feeling to us
Love is more
Love is much more than a beautiful feeling
Love is
Love is much more, it's so much more
