Song Name: Sleep Apnea
Pardon me, I didn't realize what's in your eyes
My arms are open wide, but I can't ever decide what I wanna do
I'm staring at the sky but I can't tell which way my thoughts are traveling
I try to listen to your words but I can't feel my head and it's unraveling
Sometimes I'm the one to know what it means to care about the things you want to do
Everybody's living or they're dead and I'm still in my bed, I don't have a clue
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
