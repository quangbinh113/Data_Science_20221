Song Name: Weekend Friend
Darling, what you waiting there for?
I got you alone, but I don't wanna go
And, darling, what you waiting there for?
I got you alone, but I don't really know
I will try
To leave you alone
And I will try
To leave you alone
Darling, what you waiting there for?
I got you alone, but I don't wanna go
And, darling, what you waiting there for?
I got you alone, but I don't really know
I will try
To leave you alone
And I will try
To leave you alone
(Darling, what you waiting there for?) I will try
(I got you alone, but I don't wanna go) to leave you alone
(And, darling, what you waiting there for?) And I will try
(I got you alone, but I don't really know) to leave you alone

(Darling, what you waiting there for?) I will try
(I got you alone, but I don't wanna go) to leave you alone
(And, darling, what you waiting there for?) And I will try
(I got you alone, but I don't really know) to leave you alone
