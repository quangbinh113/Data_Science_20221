Song Name: please never fall in love again
Could've been one lonely night
Just like the others
But you lit up my life
This is what it's like to be lovers
You and me need never be lonely again
Spin with me endlessly or at least until the end
Please never fall in love again
Oh, please never fall in love again
And if some other guy catches your eye
Please just text me your goodbye
You know I don't look pretty when I cry
And I don't want that to be your final glimpse of me, baby
But if you could please return my Shrek DVDs, maybe
Please never fall in love again
Oh, please never fall in love again
