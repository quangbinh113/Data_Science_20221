Song Name: cotton candy
Tallulah knows that she's not the only one I'm holding close
On the low, I get vertigo from body overdose
So tell me your name and tell me your problems
I got the same
And I wanna get stuck between your teeth like cotton candy
So you'll remember me, darling
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
I figured out that the modern world is
Turning the wrong way 'round
There's something about the way
Our bedsheets turn religion upside down
So we just have sex to solve all our problems
Let's do it again
And I wanna get stuck between your teeth like cotton candy
So you'll remember me, darling
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
Leave me in the morning
Although, I don't wanna be on my own
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know

I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
Leave me in the morning
Although, I don't wanna be on my own
I'm losing myself in you
And you, and you, and you, and you, I know
