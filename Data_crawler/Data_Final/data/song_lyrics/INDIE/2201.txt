Song Name: The Clouds Cleared the Way
Temple of Assisi
Stain glass windows
The gravity, serenity
Washing all over me, yeah
I am all that I need
I am all that I choose
But you should come and walk with me
Among the rhododendron
Finally the picture of
Faces that I pray to
Feeling love, sensational
I can feel it pickin' up
I'll leave it all up to you
I can wait a thousand years
For you to be, eternally
The morning that I wake to
Phila, firefly
Of the corner of my eye
Of the corner of my eye
