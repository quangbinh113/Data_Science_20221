Song Name: It's U
I guess it's just another one of those nights
When I'll spend way too much time
On something so small that no one really cares about at all
I guess it's just another one of those thoughts
And I can't really find a cause
Whether it's all just in my mind or something more here in my life
It's u, it's u
Oh god, it's u
It's u
If you're awake then I am too
If you're lost then I'll find you
If you're hurt then I'll fix you

If you go blind I'll describe the view
If you can't feel then I'll hold you
If you fall know I've got you
And if you fall down too far and I can't see you through these marks
And your eyes are covered in scars, and my head's filling with tar
Don't worry we'll find another way out
Your silhouette doesn't look quite right
And I can never find the time

To bury my hands in words
I'd grow a new kind of evergreen tree, just for you and me
On second thoughts, will you even remember me?
But it's always been u (It's always been u)
It's always been u (It's always been u)
It's always been u (It's always been u)

It's always been u (It's always been u)
It's always been u (It's always been u)
It's always been u
Is it me for u?
