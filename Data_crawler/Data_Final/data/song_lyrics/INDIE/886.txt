Song Name: When We Feel Young
I found you passing by in cold December
Lost in view, but still your face and your gaze I remember
Looking at the diamonds in your eyes
Shine in the pale moonlight
We've come so far
Looking up above to the sky
Everything just seems so fine
This is our time
Into the night
I feel alive
At 59
When we feel young
I found us
Reminiscing our days together
Found our names
Written in the stars forever
Looking back at all that we've been through
A fairy tail come true
I'm there for you
Looking up above into the sky
Everything just seems so fine
This is our time
Into the night

I feel alive
At 59
When we feel young
Into the the night

I feel alive
This is the time
When we feel young
बारिशों में भीगे हुए हम
झूमे-नाचे यहाँ
ख्वाहिशें मेरी पूरी हुई अब
ये अपनी दास्तां
बारिशों में भीगे हुए हम
झूमे-नाचे यहाँ
ख्वाहिशें मेरी पूरी हुई अब

ये अपनी दास्तां
