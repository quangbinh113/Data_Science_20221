Song Name: Maraschino Love
Around four in the morning
It was dark, I was lonely
And you swore to God that you know me
And I lied, said yes, so you'd hold me
From the back of the hallway
Pulled you into the doorway
Swimming in champagne, not a worry
We were both fucked up in the story
Your lips, a sugar rush
Like candy on my tongue
Once I got a taste, I couldn't stop
Wanted every drop, give me all you got
I'll sip you out the bottle, you're so sweet like cherry pop
Was like, "Oh my God," my new favorite drug
You go down like liquid velvet, maraschino love
I was lost in the moment
We were dancing to Bowie
Going round and round in an orbit
Got my head spinning, making no sense
Your lips, a sugar rush
Like candy on my tongue
Once I got a taste, I couldn't stop
Wanted every drop, give me all you got
I'll sip you out the bottle, you're so sweet like cherry pop
It's like, "Oh my God," my new favorite drug
You go down like liquid velvet, maraschino love
Oh my God, baby, never stop
It's not good enough when I'm not on top
Oh my God, hope it never stops
I might overdose in the name of love
Wanted every drop, give me all you got
I'll sip you out the bottle, you're so sweet like cherry pop
It's like, "Oh my God" (it's like, "Oh my God")
My new favorite drug (my new favorite drug)
You go down like liquid velvet, maraschino love
(Like liquid velvet)
