Song Name: Looking For Somebody (To Love)
Somebody running through the field
Somebody should've stayed home
Somebody picking up the body of somebody they were getting to know
Somebody lacking in desire
The type you just don't fuck
A supreme gentleman with a gun in his hand
Lo-lo-lo-looking for somebody to love
Looking for somebody to love

Looking for somebody to love
I wanna show him he's a bitch
I wanna fuck him up good
I wanna smash the competition
Go and kill it like a man should
"You gotta show me how to push
If you don't want a shove"
Are the words of a young man already damned
Lo-lo-lo-looking for somebody to love
Looking for somebody to love

Looking for somebody to love
Oh, they ran, oh, they ran, should've seen how they ran
When I was looking for somebody to love
You should've seen it, man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Looking for somebody to love
Oh, they ran, oh, they ran, should've seen how they ran
When I was looking for somebody to love
You should've seen it, man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Looking for somebody to love
Somebody lying on the field
Somebody crying on the phone
Somebody picking up the body
Of somebody they were getting to know
Maybe we're lacking in desire
Maybe it's just all fucked
But the boy with the plan and a gun in his hand
Was lo-lo-lo-looking for somebody to love
Looking for somebody to love
Looking for somebody to love
Oh, they ran, oh, they ran, should've seen how they ran
When I was looking for somebody to love
You should've seen it, man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Looking for somebody to love
