Song Name: 4am
I'm thinking too much again
I can't sleep, it's 4am
I got to be in somewhere tomorrow
I don't wanna go out tomorrow

I'm thinking too much again
How my life will end?
I have to live tomorrow
I don't wanna live tomorrow
I'm thinking too much again
I can't sleep, it's 4am
I got to be in somewhere tomorrow
I don't wanna go out tomorrow
Fuck my thoughts
I think too much
I think too much
Fuck my thoughts
I think too much
I think too much
