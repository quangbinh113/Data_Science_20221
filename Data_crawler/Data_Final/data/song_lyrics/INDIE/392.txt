Song Name: Love It If We Made It
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information, access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings! Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay, modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
"And poison me, daddy," I got the Jones, right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone, a beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep, the poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us! Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
Consultation, degradation
Fossil fueling, masturbation
Immigration, liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch
"I moved on her like a bitch", excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools, "Thank you, Kanye, very cool!"
The war has been incited, and guess what? You're all invited
And you're famous, modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
