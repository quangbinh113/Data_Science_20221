Song Name: Happy Ending
Too far away
You're too far away
Always knew we could've been something
And it went right through me
I know your tone
But I won't admit
I'm all alone
The lights are flashing
You're in the back
Of my mind, baby
It's all intact
We tried it once, but you don't listen
We both know you wanna stay
And I won't chase you, but it's not over
I can't see your face
But we're too far away
I'm reading all the writings on the wall
And if you don't run away
Could be a happy ending after all
It's deeper than fantasy
Always knew we could've been something
Your lips and mine, babe (mine, baby)
Out on the floor (on the floor)
We're intertwinеd, baby (intertwined, baby)
I'm wanting more, morе, more, more, more, more, more
Let's play catch, baby (let's play catch, baby)
I'ma throw it back (throw it back)
I'll blow your mind, baby (blow your mind, baby)
I'll be exactly (I'll be exactly what-)
Be what you want, so why the prison?
We both know you wanna stay
If you come over, I'll bring the inside out
Just invade my space
We're too far away
I'm reading all the writings on the wall
And if you don't run away
Could be a happy ending after all
It's deeper than fantasy
