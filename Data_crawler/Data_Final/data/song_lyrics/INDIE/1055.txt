Song Name: Reflections
Where have you been?
Do you know when you're comin' back?
Since you've been gone
I've got along, but I've been sad
I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've, but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More, but it's a chore for you to give
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're comin' back?
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Fallin' just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
(I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes
I know you're sick
Hopin' you fix whatever's broken
Ignorant bliss
And a few sips might be the potion
I tried to put it out for you to get
Coulda, shoulda, but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More, but it's a chore for you to give
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're comin' back?
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Fallin' just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
(I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes
(Tell me you see it too)
So close, so close
Yet so far away (so far)
I don't know (I don't) how to be solo (no)
So don't go, oh, no, just stay
You and I were bright, shootin' through the sky daily (yeah)
Lightin' up the night, wasn't always right, baby (mm-hm)
Yeah, every time that we realign, it's crazy
And you save me
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Fallin' just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
(I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes
(I sold my soul for you, I know you see it too)
Yeah, I bought the same ones too
I know you're tired, I know you tried
To say your point of view, yeah
Sick of all the poison in me
What the hell do you want from me, babe? Uh-huh
I see myself in you, I see myself in you, baby
I see myself in you, alright
I sold my soul for you, maybe you should stick with us now
