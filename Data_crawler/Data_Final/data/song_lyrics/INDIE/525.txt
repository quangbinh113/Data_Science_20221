Song Name: something new
We've only just started
So hold on, hold on
We've only just started
So hold on, hold on
In my head I see a place
And it looks like the fairytale
And I hope to be there some day
Maybe I'll see your face
It's only you, only you
Only you, only you
It's only you, only you
Only you, only you

There's no looking back now
I'll stay here, stay here
There's no looking back now

I'll stay here
In my head I see a place
And it looks like the fairytale
And I hope to be there some day
Maybe I'll see your face
It's only you, only you
Only you, only you
It's only you, only you
Only you, only you
