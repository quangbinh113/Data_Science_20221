Song Name: Bedside
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Burning all our daylight in the talking stage
Only for you to decide that I'm not worth the wait
Why do I fall in love? All over again
I'm left with all you lost, but what did I expect?
Lessons learned are null and void, at this point I don't care
Alone's not something I enjoy, it's something I endure, so
I'll ignore your red flags when they pop in my head
'Cause I told myself from day one, you're the best that I could get
I don't need you
But I need someone here
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Dusting off the dashboard, first time in a while
Trying to get my shit together, 'cause it's been running high
Blow the covers off my chest to see who's standing there
'Cause being near your person has forced mine to disappear
I don't need you
But I need someone here
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
I know that there's heaven
Somewhere nearby
But I won't ever find it (I won't ever find it)
With you in my bedside (bedside)
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
