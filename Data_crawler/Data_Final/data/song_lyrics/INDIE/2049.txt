Song Name: Only in My Dreams
Baby stay with me
I feel it happening
I guarantee
With every inch of me
Tonight I'll sleep
With demons in my hair
That talk to me
It's only just a dream
Baby stay here
The whispers in the trees
Are getting near
You're everything I need
To bare this fear
The demons in my bed
They're always here
It's only just a dream
Babe, I'd rather stay inside your dream
If I could disappear beneath the leaves
