Song Name: i walk this earth all by myself
I walk this earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs, but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand, but my grip just gives out
Oh-oh,
Oh-oh
Oh-oh,
Oh-oh
Oh-oh,
Oh-oh
Oh-oh,
Oh-oh
Nobody gives a fuck about me
That's what I think to myself when I'm alone in the city
I walk around the mall, but there's nobody with me
What do I say when there's nobody listening?
I walk this earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs, but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand, but my grip just gives out
I walk this earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs, but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand, but my grip just gives out
