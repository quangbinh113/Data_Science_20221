Song Name: When Am I Gonna Lose You
Wait, when am I gonna lose you?
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?
Trace the curving on the coastline
Santa Lucia cliffside
We'll stay here for the night
I remember you said
Everything has its place
Now we'll lie in our bed
Wondering how to explain
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose?
Take another one if you need it
Or do you already feel it?
I felt it from the start
Engrave the silhouette of you dancing
A shadow play that we're cast in
On the cabin walls
You were floating to me
In a slow motion fade
I could finally see
Between belief and faith
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you, you?

When am I gonna lose?
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees summoned down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees summoned down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
When am I gonna lose?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you, you?
When am I gonna lose?
