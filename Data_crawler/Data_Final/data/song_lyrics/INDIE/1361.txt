Song Name: Be Alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
I know I messed up, I know I've lied
I need your forgiveness most of the time
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
Life is in my head tell me things I don't wanna hear
I'm tryna talk to God, ask for help, I don't wanna fear
All the things around me surround me like I'm a big deal
But then I look around me, no one's 'round me, what's the big deal?
Tryna talk to you, mum, but we speak in different languages
I know you used to pray that we could speak without the barriers
And still to this day we haven't had that conversation
I'm sorry you're still waiting
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
I know I messed up, I know I've lied
I need your forgiveness most of the time
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
Oh my
Gon' be okay
Well, I hope so
Now I'll go pray
Take time
Gon' be more life
Yeah, are we alright?
Yeah, are we alright?
Oh my
Gon' be okay
Well, I hope so
Now I'll go pray
Take time
Gon' be more life
Yeah, are we alright?
Yeah, are we alright?
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
I know I messed up, I know I've lied
I need your forgiveness most of the time
Tell me everything's gon' be alright for me
Oh my
Gon' be okay
Well, I hope so
Now I'll go pray
Take time
Gon' be more life
Yeah, are we alright?
Yeah, are we alright?
Oh my
Gon' be okay
Well, I hope so
Now I'll go pray
Take time
Gon' be more life
Yeah, are we alright?
Are we alright?
