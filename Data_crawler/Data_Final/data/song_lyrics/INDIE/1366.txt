Baby
I just keep coming back to you
Can't help myself over you
I know you don't care but I do
All the things I'd do for you
Oh for you
I know its been a while girl
I keep coming back to you
I keep coming for you
You and me
Oh don't you know I love you girl (to you)
I guess I should've
Let you know before you go (keep coming for you)
I know its been a while girl
I keep coming back to you
I keep coming for you
You and me girl
You broke me and I'll never forgive you
I'll never be the same again
Because either way, either way, either way what can I say
Oh don't you know I love you girl (to you)
I guess I should've
Let you know before you go (keep coming for you)
I won't (I wont)
Give up (give up)
On us (on us)
Not too soon
Is it too late for us baby
I couldn't give up on us
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Breaking me a little bit more)
Can't you see
Can't you see you're breaking me
(Breaking me a little)
Is it okay if I hate myself (I)
Its not like you ever cared about me
Never in you're life (I really really fucking hate)
I know I know I know "you've changed"
You really made me fucking change myself (myself)
Now I don't know what to do with myself
Was there something wrong with me?
I couldn't give up on us
I couldn't give up on us
Were so scared
Just kids trying to
Figure out the world this wasn't
Ever gonna work I knew that
Maybe in another world
Violet
