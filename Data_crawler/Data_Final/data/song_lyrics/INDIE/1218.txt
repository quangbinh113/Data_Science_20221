Song Name: Renegades - Acoustic
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Got a fire in my soul
I've lost my faith in this broken system
Got love for my home
But if we cry, is there anyone listening?
We're the forgotten generation
We want an open conversation
Follow me on this road
You know we gotta let go
For all of the times that they say it's impossible
They built all the hurdles, the walls, and the obstacles
When we're together, you know we're unstoppable now
I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again
It's not our fate, we could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again, we could be the renegades
They've been holding us down
They've been telling us to change our voices
But we're not part of that crowd
We made our bed and we'll make our own choices
We're maybe underestimated
But I know one day we will make it
Time to say it out loud
We are young and we're proud
すり込まれ 塗り重ねられた
嘘は僕らを飲み込んだ
We gotta fight for our rights and the things we love now
I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again
It's not our fate, we could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again, we could be the renegades
We could be renegades
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready to fly
I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again
It's not our fate, we could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again, we could be the renegades (we could be renegades)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We could be renegades
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
