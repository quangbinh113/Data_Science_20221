Song Name: i'm sad
Temporary people
Temporary feelings
Everything's so pointless
Say a bunch of stuff
Make me fall in love
Then we'll give it up
There's no reason to live
There's no reason to live
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
Hey girl, you're a cutie
Wait, no that's a watermelon
It's been so long since I had any affection from a woman
I'm so lonely
I don't have a reason to live
I'm searching for a reason to live
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I've been holed up way too long, yeah
I've been trying to forget her
How can she just go so easy
Now I'm giving up completely
I've been trying way too hard, yeah
I've been needing to move on and
How can she just come so briefly?
Always falling hard, so deeply
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
You wanna know what's sad?
You can give everything you have to a person
And you can be perfect for that person
You could be everything they've ever wanted
You could do everything perfectly
And it still wouldn't be enough
Because nothing's ever enough
And everyone sucks
