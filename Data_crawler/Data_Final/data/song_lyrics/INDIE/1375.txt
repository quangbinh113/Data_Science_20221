Song Name: Face
Saw you paint a picture of a face
A face that wasn't even close to mine
I know I shouldn't be in love, but it's so hard to move on
You haven't changed, you've stayed the same
But if you did, I'd still love you anyway
I'd give you the world like I promised I would
Even though you wouldn't do the same
I'd give the world like I promised I would
Even though you wouldn't do the same
Had this conversation more than ten times
After nine, I still wished you were mine
Haven't ate in seven days, cause I've been up 'til 6am
Wrote five songs all just for you
Three of them I can't bear listening to
I'd give you the world like I promised I would
Even though you wouldn't do the same
I'd give you the world like I promised I would
Even though you wouldn't do the same
I'd do anything you've wanted to
'Cause I love you
