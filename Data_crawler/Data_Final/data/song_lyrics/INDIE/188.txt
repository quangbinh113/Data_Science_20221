Song Name: Drunk on Halloween
I know where you've been
Don't try to act like I don't know you
And all the words you don't hear
They always find a way back to you now
Say a new day has dawned
But we no longer get to
'Cause I know the truth
The leaves are all gone, so who's moving on?
I know the worst is to come
On that Halloween you told me
You weren't drinking, I believed you
Now the only time I have's to
Sit and wonder if you're thinking
About the fun you've had with someone else
I know the truth Is wasted on you
I know what you wanted
Under the lies, you take 'em and find a way
To run out the door now
Back to a time that you tried to forget
Why's the music so loud
Take it to the lawn now
Did you think about me if I ever were to find out?
Can you ease the pain with drinking all night?
Guess you'll never know if you never try
On that Halloween you told me
You weren't drinking, I believed you
Now the only time I have's to
Sit and wonder if you're thinking
About the fun you've had with someone else
I know the truth is wasted on you
You had the choice
I thought we had it made
What's done is done
What's left to say?
I know you better
I know you better now
I know you better
I know you better now
I know you better
I know you better now
I know you better
I know you better now
