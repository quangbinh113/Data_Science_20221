Song Name: Harbor
Okay, I'm finished now
And I kept my faith for long enough
And I hope I'm old and fairly sober
If I'm let down

Maybe you keep me around
For the constant affirmations
While I scrounge for understanding
And fall out
I'll let you win and I'll let you tie
The ribbon to my hair
Just so that we could come back to this
If we really cared
The morning gates stay open
If you had a thought that I'd be there
Oh, I'd be there
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Know we could use a break
Because I can't feel my feet
Carried you all the way upstairs
So you can sleep and I can think
Stand guard
When I am near
Clinging on
To everything you fear
Keeping mе close
While you hold me out and say
"I don't lovе you that way"
Harbor myself away from everyone else
I'm half-awake and intimate
Eyes closed and I'll commit
What I wish I had with you
I'll pretend until it's true
I don't love you that way
Swallow the pill
It's only fair that I hear
Know myself better
Than I have in years
I don't know why
I have to defend what I feel
I try
Stand your guard
When I am near
Loathe me until
You're reminded of the deal
One of us knows
When you hold me out and say
"You don't love me that way"
