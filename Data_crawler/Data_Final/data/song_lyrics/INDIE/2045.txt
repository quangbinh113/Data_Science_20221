Song Name: Do You Wanna Talk
I hold on tight to something strong 'cause I'm about to fall
The Leaning Tower of Pisa's got nothing on me, you know
I'd like to think that I call the shots
But my own reflection tells me I'm not
She said, "Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk"
But I'm not thinking straight
I guess I'm gonna pay for this
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
But both my eyes are glazed
As I stumble away from you
I'm so removed I get consumed by every single song
I spilt my drink and now I think some coke head's kickin' off
I'd like to think that I call the shots
But by the look on your face, I think I've not
She said, "Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk"
But I'm not thinking straight
I guess I'm gonna pay for this
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
But both my eyes are glazed
As I stumble away from you
From you
I don't know what I even said
I hope that it is something I won't regret
I don't know what I even said
I hope that it is something I won't regret
She said, "Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk"
But both my eyes are glazed
As I stumble away from you
From you
