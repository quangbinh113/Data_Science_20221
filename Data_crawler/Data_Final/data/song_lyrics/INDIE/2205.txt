Song Name: Therapy
When you smile, your eyes light up like a fire

So sad to say, you haven't smiled in a while
Lately it's been hard, and we got nothing to talk about
But I won't give up, let's work it out
'Cause I'm on your side
Through the dark nights
And the hard times
If you cry
I will dry your eyes
I want you to talk about
The way you feel inside
You'll always be safe with me
Just put your hand in mine
Just let me be your therapy
Tonight
So let me be your therapy
Tonight
Let me open your blinds, I wanna show you the sun
Feel it all on your skin
Light beams like a drug
Lately you've been distant, gonna try my best to fix it
I won't give up, 'till we work it out
I want you to talk about
The way you feel inside
You'll always be safe with me
Just put your hand in mine
Just let me be your therapy
Tonight
Just let me be your therapy
Tonight
'Cause I'm on your side
Through the dark nights
And the hard times
If you cry
I will dry your eyes
I want you to talk about
The way you feel inside
You'll always be safe with me
Just put your hand in mine
Just let me be your therapy
Tonight
So let me be your therapy
Tonight
