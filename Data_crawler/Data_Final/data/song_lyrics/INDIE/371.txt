Song Name: Brooklyn Baby
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze
I'm churnin' out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines
I say
I say
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-ta-da-da-da-da
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burnin' up, I'm coolin' down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see
But I'm free, ooh-ooh
I'm free
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it, you can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fuckin' explain it
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh-ooh, woah
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-pa-da-pa-da, yeah
Yeah, yeah
