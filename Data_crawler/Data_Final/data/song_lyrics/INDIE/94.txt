Song Name: Spiderhead
I am the one you left for dead (say you wanted to)
You are the bullet in my head (ahh)
And as you stand over my grave (tell me it's okay)
You'll pause the lips upon my face (ahh)
Either I'm in heaven, or I'm in hell
Am I losing my mind? Yeah ('cause I can't tell)
I've been waiting for answers for way too long
Seems I'm always waiting around
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
I think your mother wants me dead (say you wanted to)
I am a schizophrenic man (ahh)
I wouldn't change you if I could (say you wanted to)
Treat me good, I'll play it cool
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, baby I'm not blind...
