Song Name: Don't You (Forget About Me) - Remastered 2001
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-hoo, woah
Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Givin' me everything inside and out, and
Love's strange, surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby
Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me
Will you stand above me
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps fallin', rain keeps fallin'
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by?
Rain keeps fallin', rain keeps fallin'
Down, down, down, down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-hoo, woah
Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling, we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defences
Vanity, insecurity, ah
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Going to take us apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby
Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
When you walk away?
Or will you walk away?
When you walk on by
Come on, call my name
Won't you call my name?
I sing, "La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
When you walk on by (walk on by)
And you call my name
