Song Name: reckless driving
I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn't think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can't focus on the road when I'm in your car
Now we're going 100
Your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at 180
And I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen
You'd rather die than take your eyes off me
I don't love you like that
I'm a careful driver
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
But you love me like that
You're a reckless driver
And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go
I don't know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you say "shotgun"
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell you
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment
Now we're at 100
My hands aren't on the wheel (hands aren't on the wheel)
And I don't wanna lose this moment
Want you to know just how I feel (just how I feel)
Now we're at 180
And I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into a tree
I don't know how it happened
Guess I'd die to keep your eyes on me
'Cause I love you like that
I'm a reckless driver
You tell me all the time to keep my eyes on the road
Do you love me like that?
If I keep on driving
Would you hold me when we crash, or would you let me go?
Don't wanna scrape you off the pavement
I can't be your savior
I don't wanna be here when you lose control
Don't wanna watch it as it happens
See the crowd's reaction
I don't wanna be here when you kill us both
'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road (and you tell me all the time to keep my eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver (if I keep on driving)
And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go (would you hold me when we crash?)
'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road (and you tell me all the time to keep me eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And one day it'll kill us if I-
