Song Name: Devil Doesnâ€™t Bargain
The devil doesn't bargain
It's useless, don't do this, it's hubris to try
He's ruthless, you knew this, I told you, didn't I?
He's abusive, elusive, the truth is he lies
I know you don't want to let go
And just like before, I can see that you're sure
You can change him, but I know you won't
The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
I'm not one to lecture, talk down to a friend
I don't mean to pressure, mean to condescend
But I just want what's best for you in the end
I know you don't want to let go
And just like before, I can see that you're sure
You can change him, but I know you won't
The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
And I know you think he'll change this time
But I think that you will find
The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
