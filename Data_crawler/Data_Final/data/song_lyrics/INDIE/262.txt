Song Name: the sideline
I can't seem to share my
Feelings with you
I try but it's just way too hard
To go and tell the truth
I don't seem to have the guts
I'm just sitting on the side
People try to help me out
But I insist that I'm fine
But I'm not
'Cause you're here
And my face is red from ear to ear
And I can't
And I won't
Tell you what you might not want to hear
Though I never know what may have happened
Between the two of us
I'd rather not go ruin what we have by making
A big old fuss
So I'll just wait on the sideline
I'll just wait on the sideline
I'll just wait on the sideline
I'm just a friend to you
Even if you think I'm cute
I'll never be more to you
The idea is not moot
So I guess I'll just keep hoping on the unimaginable
The likelihood of me being with you
Is so unfathomable, oh
It's also unimaginable, oh
It's also unfathomable
I don't have the courage
To lose you
Or maybe I'm just not brave enough
To keep you
These thoughts they fill my mind
But the truth is that I still can't help to think
I'd be declined
I can't seem to share my
Feelings with you
I try but it's just way too hard
To go and tell the truth
I don't seem to have the guts
I'm just sitting on the side
People try to help me out
But I insist that I'm just fine
But I'm not
'Cause you're here
And my face is red from ear to ear
But I can't
And I won't
Tell you what you I think you might not want to hear
