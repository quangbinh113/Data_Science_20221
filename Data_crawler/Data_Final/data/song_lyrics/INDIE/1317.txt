Song Name: Manta Rays
Been tryin' to dream of you for so long
I can't even remember
When I first decided your face was the one I wanted
My mind to conjure
I never knew manta rays were so big
Til' I got high and had to Google it
I'm not obsessed
The feeling's just there, and I'm trying hard to forget you
Trying hard to forget you
Your honey voice echoes in every noise
And I know this is just how it goes
I know, I know, I know, I know
My therapist will tell me that it's best to let it be
But I wanna light fires, I wanna explode
I wanna be everything you want to know
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's always for you
It's all for you
It's never not for you
It's all for you
It's always for you
I wanna be your shining pearl
Your one in the world
The type you wanna lean on
Wish I were something suited for that
I skip every song that won't remind me of you 'cause if it doesn't
It's not worth the time, I wish I had more time with you

I wanna be your everything
Wanna be more than what I am in general
Don't tell me that this means anything
I promise, I understand
But it's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's always for you
It's all for you
It's never not for you
It's all for you
It's still all for you
