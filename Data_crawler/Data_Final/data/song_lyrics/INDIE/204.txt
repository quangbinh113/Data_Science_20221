Song Name: 1 SIDED LOVE
You're too busy talking over me
To hear what I'm saying
You're too high to realize I see
Through the smile that you're faking
You're so into yourself
Everyone else is overrated
And everything's changing
Is your heart worth breaking?
One-sided, one-sided, one-sided love
Our time is, our time is, our time is up
Trying to make this work, it ain't enough
One-sided, one-sided, one-sided love
And you don't even notice, do you?
Everything perfect to you
Think you loved the idea of
Us more than the real thing
Hope your heart don't break too much
You're too busy talking
Over me to hear what I'm saying
You're too high to realize I see
Through the smile that you're faking
You're so into yourself
Everyone else is overrated
And everything's changing
Is your heart worth breaking?
I'm missing the way that it used to be
You say I changed; maybe you changed me
I swear lettin' you down
Lettin' you down is hard enough
When its one-sided, one-sided, one-sided love
You don't even notice, do you?
Everything perfect to you
Think you loved the idea of
Us more than the real thing
Hope your heart don't break too much
You're too busy talking over me
To hear what I'm saying
You're too high to realize I see
Through the smile that you're faking
You're so into yourself
Everyone else is overrated
And everything's changing
Is your heart worth breaking?
Is your heart worth breaking?
Is your heart worth breaking?
Is your heart worth breaking?
Is your heart worth breaking?
