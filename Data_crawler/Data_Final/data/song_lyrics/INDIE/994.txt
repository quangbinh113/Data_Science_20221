Song Name: Can't Get You out Of My Head
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your loving is all i think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, it's more than I dare to think about
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your loving is all I think
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, it's more than I dare to think about
Every night and every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Won't you lay

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, it's more than I dare to think about
There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free
Set me free
Feel the need in me
Feel the need in me
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
