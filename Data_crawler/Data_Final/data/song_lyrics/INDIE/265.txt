Song Name: Claudia
I think you're gonna change my plans
With those emerald eyes
But you don't even understand
How much they're on my mind
Feels like I'm breathing in and out without permission
Waiting on your badges by the phone
I might be headed in the opposite direction
But I'd love
To drive you home
Oh, I'm in trouble now
Come kiss me black and blue
Might last another round
But I'm gonna fall for you
Taking a stranger's hair
I got familiarized
Now without a second glance
I wouldn't save the night
I'd spend it all
Every penny on you
There's nothing in the wallet
Worth a thing I can't loose
I'd spend it all
Every penny on you
Feels like I'm breathing in and out
Without permission
Waiting on your badges by the phone
I might be headed in the opposite direction
But I'd love
To drive you home
Oh, I'm in trouble now
Come kiss me black and blue
Might last another round
But I'm gonna fall for you
We're undercover now
I don't know what you do
Just know I'll love it down
I'm gonna fall for you
I want you feeling my lungs
And pulling me under
Tip off of my tongue
It's making me wonder
Feeling my lungs and pulling me under
I think you're gonna change my plans
With those emerald eyes
And you don't even understand
Just how far I dive
