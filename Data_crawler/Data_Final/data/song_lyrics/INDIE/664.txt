Song Name: Right These Wrongs
Help me help you out
(I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt
(Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out
You don't want help
See you in hell
I know that you burnt out a couple times
Your life that you wasted before you died
You lived no regrets, tell them all you're fine
Ain't it a lie?
A sorry excuse for a rotten soul
You had all your fun time to pay the toll
And now you're down here with nowhere to go
And nobody knows
Help me help you out
(I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt
(Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out
You don't want help
See you in hell
Behind every lie I can take a stance
Behind every demon's another chance
I'll be the one to give a second glance
According to plans
Broken and damned, I'ma set them straight
Their burden to bear, I can hold the weight
Sent down to burn, but it ain't too late
Rewriting their fate
Help me help you out
(I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt
(Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out
You don't want help
See you in hell
You know I still believe
(We could wash it all away)
Your sins could be redeemed
(Enjoy your stay)
I'm trying to right these wrongs
It's been so long
But I'll stay strong
