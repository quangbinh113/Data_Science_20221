Song Name: Dizzy (feat. Thomas Headon and Alfie Templeman)
I'm on my own tonight
Running through the Milky Way
Got a 4:20 flight
And know I won't be late
Love and nothing else
I never felt this good before
I'm far from someone else
Let's fly away, away
I'm gonna fly, fly on the ceiling
50-foot high, head through the ceiling
Oh, it's got me dizzy like
Yeah, it's got me dizzy right now
Chemical change in my serotonin
Staring at the fan and my head is spinning
Oh, it's got me dizzy like
Yeah, it's got me dizzy right now
Dizzy like, dizzy like
Dizzy like, dizzy like
Dizzy like, dizzy like
Dizzy like, dizzy like
My еyes are burning red
Spinning out insidе my room
Never wanna leave my bed
Do whatever I wanna do
Love and nothing else
I've never felt this good before
I'm far from someone else
Let's fly away, away
I'm gonna fly, fly on the ceiling
50-foot high, head through the ceiling
Oh, it's got me dizzy like
Yeah, it's got me dizzy right now
Chemical change in my serotonin
Staring at the fan and my head is spinning
Oh, it's got me dizzy like
Yeah, it's got me dizzy right now
Dizzy like, dizzy like (it's got me dizzy like)
Dizzy like, dizzy like (got me dizzy like)
Dizzy like, dizzy like (got me dizzy like)
Dizzy like, dizzy like
