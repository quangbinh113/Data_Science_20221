Song Name: Untitled V.2
I know my hands aren't warm enough to hold
Your cold, cold heart
And I know my bones aren't strong enough to keep me from
Falling apart
Did you know sometimes I dig into the carpet with my feet?
And did you know that every night I play your favourite songs on repeat? (Repeat)
It helps me sleep (it helps me sleep)
Because my hair is growing backwards and my knees are bending inwards
And the monsters in the closet won't stop giving me the shivers
Even though it's probably just in my mind
