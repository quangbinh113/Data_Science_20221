Song Name: Roll With The Punches
I've been told this takes time
It's something I don't get, but it's something on my mind
Ooh
And we can dance if we want
I'm good at forgetting 'bout whats going on
Ooh
But I always cared for you
Fall on both knees, too
Let me tell you something true
Can't make it off but these things never do, aye
Oh, I'll never be fooled
Even though now I want to
Don't you know it's true?
Roll out the punches, never through
And she said
Don't you worry 'bout me
You know I'm on my own team
And I can find another you
One that loves me more, too
I don't need to play games
I sense the brother doesn't feel that way
Ooh
Self control I don't like
But if you hold me, I always hold you back
Ooh
But I always cared for you
Fall on both knees, too
Let me tell you something true
Can't make it off but these things never do, aye
Oh, I'll never be fooled
Even though now I want to
Don't you know it's true?
Roll out the punches, never through
And she said
Don't you worry 'bout me
You know I'm on my own team
And I can find another you
One that loves me more, too
Oh I never, oh I never
Oh I never, ever put you down
Oh I never, oh I never
Oh I never, ever put you down
