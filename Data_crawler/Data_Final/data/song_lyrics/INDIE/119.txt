Song Name: PLASTIC STRAW
Oh I'm so sick of love
You're turning me into another person
There was nothing to discuss
You got me drunk with our goodbyes
I think I'm better without her
Running out of excuses to believe
You should take all the back roads
As long as it doesn't lead you back to me
Never comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back to me
Comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back
I'm layin' in the street
Wondering how I feel so defeated
And I wish you didn't care so much
I'm sinkin' through the pavement of your love
I think I'm better without her
Running out of excuses to believe
You should take all the back roads
As long as it doesn't lead you back to me
I think I'm better without her
Running out of excuses to believe
You should take all the back roads
As long as it doesn't lead you back to me
Never comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back to me
Comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back
You're never comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back to me
Comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back
You're never comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back to me
Comin' back
Comin' back
Comin' back
