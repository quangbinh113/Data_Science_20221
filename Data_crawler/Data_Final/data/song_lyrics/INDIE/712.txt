Song Name: Bad
All the little gifts you gave
I call it overcompensatin'
Feelin' just like a princess
Every answer was always "Yes"
You had me livin' in a dream
What's forever long to you? (To you)
Did you say that to her too? (Her too)
Makin' sure that I'd never know
Callin' her while the shower goes
Then crawl back in bed, it's a shame
I probably should've known better
I probably should've known better
Every word you said, yeah, you was sweet, but you was lyin'
Everything you covered, makin' up
Just to keep to me from cryin', oh
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is, you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wasn't catchin' on to you (To you)
Blinded by your lips so smooth (So smooth)
Excusin' all of your 'gotta go's'
Leavin' me to be all alone
Then you took my heart just the same
I probably should've known better
I probably should've known better
Every word you said, yeah, you was sweet, but you was lyin'
Everything you covered, makin' up
Just to keep to me from cryin', oh
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth, is you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
Wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
Tell me the truth
Was it worth it? Was I worth it for you?
'Cause we were perfect, we workin' 'til you
Forgot to tell me
You been seein' someone else for six years, oh
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth, is you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
Wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn't have loved me better
Now I'm left feelin' twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
