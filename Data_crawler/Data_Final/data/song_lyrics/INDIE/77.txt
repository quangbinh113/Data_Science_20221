Song Name: Sleep Alone
You hold me by the heart and you wear my soul
Last week showed me I'm scared to be all alone
I'm selling out to the dream, I'll be cool on my own
I feel dead and a half, but you're making me laugh
You're the lucid, plain view Cupid found
You're the blueprint to my stupid sounds
My face feels hot and blue
My hands still count on you to let me down
Articulate and lonely enough for the two of us
If you want, if you want, if you want to
You can call me on my phone, I'll run to you
You won't ever have to sleep alone
You can call me on my phone, I'll come to you
You won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone
Living in the dark makes your light seem cold
I distract myself awake, but in my dreams you're playing a song
I'll tell my friends we made amends, tying up loose ends in the sand
But if you want it you can have it, you can have me in full
You're the lucid, plain view Cupid found
You're the blueprint to my stupid sounds
My face feels hot and blue
My hands still count on you to let me down
Articulate and lonely enough for the two of us
If you want, if you want, if you want to
You can call me on my phone, I'll run to you
You won't ever have to sleep alone
You can call me on my phone, I'll come to you
You won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone
You're the lucid, plain view Cupid found
You're the blueprint to my stupid sounds
My face feels hot and blue
When I'm alone with you
Loneliness was built for two
Do you want, do you want, do you want to
You can call me on my phone, I'll run to you
You won't ever have to sleep alone
You can call me on my phone, I'll come to you
You won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone
My face feels hot and blue
When I'm alone with you
My face feels hot and blue
When I'm alone with you
My face feels hot and blue
When I'm alone with you
My face feels hot and blue
When I'm alone with you
