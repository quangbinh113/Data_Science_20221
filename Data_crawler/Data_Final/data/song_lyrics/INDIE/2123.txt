Song Name: Endlessly
Yourself to me, baby (baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)
If you need me now
I would hold you tight, hold you tight, I-I-I-I
If you change your mind
Don't wait 'til the moment's right, moment's right, I-I-I-I
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't say you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't say you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
Yourself to me, baby (baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)
'Cause if I decide to leave tonight
I'll have no pride (yeah)
At least I could try to be by your side
But something's not right (something's not right)
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't say you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't say you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
Yourself to me, baby (baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)
