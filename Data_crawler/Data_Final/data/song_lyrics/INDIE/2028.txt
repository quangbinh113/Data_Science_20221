Song Name: Gloom
And now I'm ready to go
I'm sick of hanging out and now I'm ready to go
I told you that our friendship couldn't handle much more
But then you went behind my back to settle the score
So goodbye
Farewell
Go fuck your mother
Go fuck yourself
And so I walk out the door
Your insults don't affect me with my favorite coat on
I know my hair looked good in the bathroom at the bar
Turns out I left my wallet at the bathroom bar
That's life
That's death
Your girlfriend scares me
She's got bad breath
Take off my shirt and socks I'm ready to go
Wash out my hair dye and I'm ready to go
Remove my shirt and tie, I'm ready to go
Undress you with my eyes, I'm ready to go
I measure up to you, I'm ready to go
I smoked my cigarettes, I'm ready to go
My eyes are dry as hell, I'm ready to go
My back is giving out, I'm ready to go
I need to walk my dog, I'm ready to go
My dog's expecting me, I'm ready to go
I hate this temperature, I'm ready to go
This music sucks to me, I'm ready to go
Oh, yeah
These people stress me out, I'm ready to go
I'm growing quite unwell, I'm ready to go
I hate this city yes I'm ready to go
Oh, no
I never liked it I belong on the road
So, goodbye
