Song Name: I felt a Funeral, in my Brain [feat. Phoebe Bridgers]
I felt a funeral in my brain
And mourners to and fro
Treading, treading, till it seemed
The sense was breaking through
And when we all were seated
A service like a drum
Beating, beating, till I thought
My mind was going numb
My mind was going
And then I heard them lift a box
And creak across my soul
With the same boots of lead again
Space, space began to toll
As all the heavens were a bell
And Being but an ear
And I, and silence, some strange race
Wrecked, solitary, here
And then a plank in reason broke
And I dropped down, and down
And hit a world at every plunge
And finished knowing, then
And finished knowing
And then I heard them lift a box
And creek around my soul
With the same boots of lead again
Space, space began to toll
I felt a funeral in my brain
And mourners to and fro
Treading, treading, till it seemed
The sense was breaking through
