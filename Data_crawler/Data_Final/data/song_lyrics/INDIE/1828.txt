Song Name: it only gets worse, i promise
Is the mirror broken, or is it just me?
I'm rippin' my hair out of shark teeth
You don't care about anything
It's not fair, it's so hard to bring you out
And I can't go on
And I can't go on
And I can't go on without you
Girl, I wrote a song about you
I don't sleep, I just lay
Awake, awake
I don't know where to go
I don't have a home anymore
Midnight, you won't call
Guess I'll walk alone
Guess I'll walk alone
Guess I'll walk alone
And I can't go on
And I can't go on
And I can't go on without you
Girl, I wrote a song about you
I don't sleep, I just lay
Awake, awake
And I can't go on without you
Girl, I wrote a song about you
I don't sleep, I just lay
Awake, awake
