Song Name: Buzzkill Bummer
I got the note that you left on my windshield
Thought it was a ticket
Didn't read it cause I been scared
Acting like a Simpson, I don't care about Springfield
Got my inhibitions listed
95 theses repeat
See, it don't feel like summer
Overcast and i'm sad
Cause you said I should lose your number
And I ain't no runner
Marathon, I'm a side ache shin splint past tense regret
Buzzkill bummer
Chase a carrot on a stick
One you know you'll never get
Take me to the other side
Where grass is green and trees fall amplified
And I can finally get some sleep at night
And I don't have to try
And you wont be dissatisfied with all my lies
And everything I look like
And no such thing as goodbyes
And I don't have to act nice.
I found your little red notebook
Tucked between my dirty clothes
And packages I haven't opened
Read it like your diary
It was just a list of plans and goals
A bunch of stuff you never told me
Probably thought it'd be too boring
Probably thought I'd make a joke at your expense
And disrespect the picket fence
You always hoped would border all your picture perfect sunsets
And listening to common sense
Has only led me to regret
Think something's broken in my head
Cause everything is telling me I should
But I don't love you yet
Don't know why you did or ever would
Cause I'm a scrub at best
Know my intuitions getting smaller
Sinking underwater
And I'm drowning
I can doggy paddle
For a little
That's about it
It don't feel like summer
Overcast and I'm sad
Cause you said I should lose your number
And I ain't no runner
Marathon I'm a side ache shin splint past tense regret
It don't feel like summer
Overcast and I'm sad
Cause you said I should lose your number
And I ain't no runner
Marathon I'm a side ache shin splint past tense regret
Buzzkill bummer
Genghis Khan in a red hood
Baked goods
Big Bad Wolf
But I ain't no sucker
Still half full cause I'm scared of the suburbs
