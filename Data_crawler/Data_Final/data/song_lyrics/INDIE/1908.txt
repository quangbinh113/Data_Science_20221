Song Name: Pretend
Keep it in the bottle
Hide from all the friends I keep
I don't need a legacy
I just need to get some sleep
Keep it in the bottle
Hide from all the friends I keep
I don't need a legacy
I don't need a legacy
Keep it from the bottom
Hide behind the friends I see
I wish I was where I need
I just think it's never been
Keep it from the bottom
Hide behind the friends I see
I wish I was where I need
I wish I was where I need
Ohh
We'll repair it on the run
We'll repair it on the run
Ohh
We'll repair it just for fun
We'll repair it just for fun
I get up
And come around
And make pretend I'm welcome
We fell out, we fell down
You look at me like I'm a ghost
I get up
And come around
And make pretend I'm welcome
We fell out, we fell down
You look at me like I'm a ghost
I get up
And come around
And make pretend I'm welcome
We fell out, we fell down
You look at me like I'm a ghost
I get up
And come around
And make pretend I'm welcome
We fell out, we fell down
You look at me like I'm a ghost
