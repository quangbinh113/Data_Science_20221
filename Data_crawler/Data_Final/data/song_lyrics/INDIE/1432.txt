Song Name: BNR
Hey, can you see
Black and red over me?
Can you believeâ€“
This whole thing? What a dream
Black and red
Black and red
Black and red
My disease (black and red, black and red)
My disease (black and red, black and red)
My disease (black and red)
My disease
Runs down my cheek
What I breathe, what I eat
Strawberry seeds
Like the shoes on my feet
Like the shoes on my feet
Like the shoes on my feet
My disease
Black and red
