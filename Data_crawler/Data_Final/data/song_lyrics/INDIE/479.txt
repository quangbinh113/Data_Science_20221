Song Name: Six Feet Under
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away, like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
They're playing our sound, laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
Six feet under, I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
