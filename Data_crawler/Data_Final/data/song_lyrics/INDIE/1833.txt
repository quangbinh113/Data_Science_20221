Song Name: You Say I'm in Love
I've been so unafraid
To die alone
I know what I've done
I heard your tone
Dust off your coat
The rain is coming back
A few months without it
Keeps happiness on track
You would never notice
Stuck in that head of yours
You say I'm in love
I say you're a fool
Look away from me now
I'll look away too
You say I'm in love
I say you're a fool
Look away from me now
I'll look away too
