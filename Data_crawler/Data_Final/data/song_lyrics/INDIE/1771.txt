Song Name: Casual
My friends call me a loser
'Cause I'm still hanging around
I've heard so many rumors
That I'm just a girl that you bang on your couch
I thought you thought of me better
Someone you couldn't lose
You said, "We're not together"
So now when we kiss, I have anger issues
You said, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...
Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now?
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now?
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, it's casual now
Dumb love, I love being stupid
Dream of us in a year
Maybe we'd have an apartment
And you'd show me off to your friends at the pier
I know, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...
Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now?
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now?
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, oh, oh, oh
It's hard being casual
When my favorite bra lives in your dresser
It's hard being casual
When I'm on the phone talking down your sister
And I try to be the chill girl that
Holds her tongue and gives you space
I try to be the chill girl but
Honestly, I'm not
Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her Long Beach house
I know what you tell your friends
Baby, get me off again
I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner
Your parents at the table, you wonder why I'm bitter
Bragging to your friends I get off when you hit it
I hate to tell the truth, but I'm sorry dude you didn't
I hate that I let this drag on so long, now I hate myself
I hate that I let this drag on so long, you can go to hell
