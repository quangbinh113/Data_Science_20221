Song Name: in my white dress
Where the skies are blue
I always think about you
Friday after school
You can take me with you
Space between your teeth
Flowers on your blue jeans
In the midst of the city
You know where to find me
No place to hide
Feelings inside
Where we collide
I'll be waiting for you
Let me just hold you
All night like I do
I can be your true lover girl
Rockin' the world with you
Let me just kiss you
All night like we used to
I can be your true lover girl
Rockin' the world with you
In my white dress
CD's on repeat
We make out in your front seat
In this lover's street
We soaked up the summer breeze
No place to hide
Feelings inside
Where we collide
I'll be waiting for you
Let me just hold you
All night like I do
I can be your true lover girl
Rockin' the world with you
Let me just kiss you
All night like we used to
I can be your true lover girl
Rockin' the world with you
In my white dress
2 lovers in this city
Stay on a flight of fancy
Make out until the morning
Oh you know like dirty dancing
Remember where you met me
We've felt so young wild free
Sweet memories of eighteen
Oh you know I'm in my white dress
