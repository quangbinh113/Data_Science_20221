Song Name: Take It Off
You don't want a girlfriend, you just want a doll
Buy her pretty dresses, take her to the mall
Got a perfect body, wanna show it off
Yeah, she's your favourite hobby
Dress her up like Barbie
Baby-
Pretty little picture
She's candy on your arm when you're with her
You play her like a winner
She's your favourite toy, little boy
Cuz she walks and she talks just like you want
Lock her up in a box and call it love
You don't want a girlfriend, you just want a doll
Buy her pretty dresses, take her to the mall
Got a perfect body, wanna show it off
She's your favourite hobby, dress her up like Barbie
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
She's your favourite hobby
Dress her up like Barbie
"Baby take it off"
Love the way the she works it
Walking home at night lookin' nervous
You say that she deserves it
"Cuz you're gonna catch some eyes, wearing jeans that fit you right"
Cuz she walks and she talks just like you want
Lock her up in a box and call it love
You don't want a girlfriend, you just want a doll
Buy her pretty dresses, take her to the mall
Got a perfect body, wanna show it off
She's your favourite hobby, dress her up like Barbie
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
She's your favourite hobby
Dress her up like Barbie
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
"Baby take it off"
You don't want a girlfriend, you just want a doll
Buy her pretty dresses, take her to the mall
Got a perfect body, wanna show it off
She's your favourite hobby, dress her up like Barbie
