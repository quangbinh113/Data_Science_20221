Song Name: Bubble Gum
Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to

Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb

Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
