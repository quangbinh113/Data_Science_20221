Song Name: Happiness is a butterfly
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another

Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
I hum it on the phone like every night
And sing it for my babies on the tour life
Ah-ah
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt

If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sittin' in your sweatshirt, cryin' in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance with you (dance, with you, dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance with you (dance, with you)
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Go down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town, I'm coming
Ah-ah
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing, I
Lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning, I
Sing it into my music, I'm crazy
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt

If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sittin' in your sweatshirt, cryin' in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance with you (Dance, with you, dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance with you (Dance, with you, dance)
