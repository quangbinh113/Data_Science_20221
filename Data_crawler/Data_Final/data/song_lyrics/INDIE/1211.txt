Song Name: To Noise Making (Sing)
Remember when you'd sing
Just for the fuck of it
Any joy it would bring
Honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back
Your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song and all its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same
It felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise
That brought you joy
You don't have to sing it right
Who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice
But honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing before we moved to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
I wan't to be your lover
Or the fisherman's blues
You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice
But honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Who could ask to be unbroken or be brave again
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again?
And who could ask you to be sound
Or to feel saved again
Or stick around until you hear that music play again?
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing
Just for the love of it
Any joy it would bring
