Song Name: Fade
Little darling, I saw you walking
I was sold
Nowhere to go, not to worry
We've got time to kill
Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you fade
Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
Little darling, oh, we've wasted
Many days
Passion passing, others laughing
Like always
Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you fade
Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
See you fade, see you fade
