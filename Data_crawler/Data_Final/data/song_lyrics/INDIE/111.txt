Song Name: Generation Why
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why?
I was off
Keying cars parked on radium lawns
By suburbian moms
I called a friend
Let's meet at ten
Go wherever we want
'Cause no one cares that we're gone
This town don't got much to do
And you and I haven't got much to lose
So do you wanna rock in your room like we always do?
Talk about how fast we grew
And all the big dreams that we won't pursue
Then get in your car and laugh 'til we both turn blue
'Cause we are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation why
Parents think we're fast asleep
But as soon as we're home, we're sneaking out the window
'Cause at this rate of earth decay
Our world's ending at noon
Could we all just move to the moon?
This town don't got much to do
And you and I haven't got much to lose
Do you wanna leave everyone in this place for good?
'Cause we are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation why
(Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?)
We're livin' night to night
(Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?)
Since we're bound to die, oh
(Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?)
What's the use in trying?
(Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?)
And it's exactly why
We are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
