Song Name: Buena
I hear a voice from the back of the room
I hear a voice cry out you want something good
Well, come on a little closer let me see your face
Yeah, come on a little closer by the front of the stage
I said come on a little closer I got something to say
Yeah, come on a little closer wanna see your face
You see I met a devil named Buena, Buena
And since I met the devil I ain't been the same, oh no
And I feel all right now, I have to tell ya
I think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
Buena, Buena, Buena, Buena, good, good, good
It's coming to me, yeah, it's coming to me
Now I, I think I know what it is you need

I know some people wanna make you change
Well I, I know how to make'm go away
You see I met a devil named Buena, Buena
And since I met the devil I ain't been the same, oh no
And I feel all right, I have to tell ya
I think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
Buena, Buena, Buena, Buena, good, good, good
