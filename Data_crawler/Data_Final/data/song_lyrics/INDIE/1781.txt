Song Name: Petrified
The bedspread was silk, but the marbles were stiff
He showed me my face, so I loosened my grip
A shadow came down, told me I live a lie
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me
A stranger convinced me to cancel my trip
He sang me a song, but it didn't exist
He said an angel came down and gave him a melody
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me
I believe in making up
I believe in making up
And I believe in what I fear
Lately, I've been able to see more clear
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me
