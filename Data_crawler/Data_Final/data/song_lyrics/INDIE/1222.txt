Song Name: To Let A Good Thing Die
You can't ask a tree to blossom
If it isn't spring
Don't leave the house at midnight
And expect the birds to sing
If you're looking for a reason
You needn't even try
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't conjure up more money
If you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days
If you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water
But you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't light a fire from nothing
Or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart
If it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies
But it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye
You can drum up the heartbeats
Of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever
'Cause nothing ever lasts
If it's keeping you from sleeping
Wipe the tear from your eye
'Cause sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
