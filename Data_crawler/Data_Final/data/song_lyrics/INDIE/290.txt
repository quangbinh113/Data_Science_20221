Song Name: Cold
It's been lonely
Trying get your attention from a thousand miles away

And you know me
Always overthinking the worst possibilities

Yeah, we both know
In between you and me, there's an ocean
Castaway in a sea and it's frozen
I'm exposed, can't you see, all I need
Is a little warmth
Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate
Or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold
I built a little boat
With a sail from the memories I've been collecting
And I'll hold out
For the wind to blow me, take me home the whole way
In your direction
Yeah, we both know
In between you and me there's an ocean
And I'm just trying to get a little closer
Pull me in, 'cause I'm here and all I need
Is a little warmth
Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate
Or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
And I need a little fire
And you're my gasoline
Light me up, I'm burning
With all these things I feel
I'll always hold this flame for you
But it's naked on the breeze
So let me in, don't lock me out
Don't cast me out to sea
Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate
Or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
