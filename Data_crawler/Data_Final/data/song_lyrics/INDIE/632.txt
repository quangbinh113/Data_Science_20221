Song Name: Release
A plant where I had grown my fruit
It's dried and hangs down like a noose
My shell has become a haunted place
The ghost inside makes me the same
I just want release
I just want release
I keep on searching, just to find
I'm absent inside this skin disguise
My shell has become a haunted place
The ghost inside makes me the same
I just want release
I just want release
