Song Name: Make My Sun Shine
It doesn't cost to feel like you've blown it all away
And you'll get lost to feelin' like you've found the way
To feel like you want it (everyday)
Like you've got it (it's not gonna stay)
Life you always wanna feel this way
You make my sun shine
You make my watch tick slowly
You make my sunshine
You make me tan in the rain
Loosen your mind when you talk
Tighten your eyes with your thoughts
Call it whatever you like
My words don't seem to mind
To feel like you want it (everyday)
Like you've got it (it's not gonna stay)
Life you always wanna feel this way
You make my sun shine
You make my watch tick slowly
You make my sunshine
You make me tan in the rain
I feel like I want it (everyday)
Like I got it (it's not gonna stay)
Life I always wanna feel this way
If it makes you feel better
That the time moves slowly
If it makes you feel better
That the time moves slowly
You make my sun shine
You make my watch tick slowly
You make my sunshine
You make me tan in the rain
