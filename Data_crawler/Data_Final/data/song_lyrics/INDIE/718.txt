Song Name: Get St√ºpid
I'm in a, a sea of people
Wondering if the floor might cave in
I can feel the subs shaking the apartment
Friends of friends are calling friends who weren't inviited
Half the room is brain-dead on some fuckin' island
BYOB, bring your own booze
DOY, bongs in the bathroom
She shotgun kissin' the frat boy in the bathtub
He bad news
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions
But I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one
Broke a window, taped it up and hid the evidence
Think I'm gonna get evicted from my residence
Dropped my phone into the toilet and it's evident
I'm out of my element, I'm out of my element
BYOB, bring your own booze
DOY, bongs in the bathroom
She shotgun kissing the frat boy in the bathtub
He bad news
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions
But I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one
(I don't trust no one)
(I don't trust no one)
I spy with my little eye
Look to my left, look to my right
Somebody sneaking by the sink
Putting anonymous into my drink
Yeah, I don't trust no one
Yeah, I don't trust no
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Lose my inhibitions
But I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one
D-d-d-d-d-dumb
