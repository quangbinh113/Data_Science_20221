Song Name: Tenderness
Tell me
Did you fall in at first glance?
Do you think you'll take a chance?
Do you think on the weekend I could know?
Show me
Before you haunt me on the screen
Will my affection pull the strings?
Another forgotten memory
We've built
This city that we're sinking in
Nobody wants to play pretend
I just know that
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
