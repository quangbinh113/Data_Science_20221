Song Name: Chaise Longue
Mommy, daddy, look at me
I went to school and I got a degree
All my friends call it "the big D"
I went to school and I got the big D
I got the big D
I got the big D
I got the big D
I went to school and I got the big D
Is your muffin buttered?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
Excuse me (what?)
Excuse me (what?)
Hey you, over there
On the chaise longue in your underwear
What are you doing sitting down?
You should be horizontal now
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
Is your mother worried?
Would you like us to assign someone to worry your mother?
Excuse me (what?)
Excuse me (what?)
Hey you, in the front row
Are you coming backstage after the show?
Because I've got a chaise longue in my dressing room
And a pack of warm beer that we can consume
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, on the chaise longue, on the chaise longue
All day long, on the chaise longue
All day long, all day long, on the chaise longue
All day long, all day long, on the chaise longue
All day long, all day long, on the chaise longue
On the chaise longue, all day long, on the chaise longue
