Song Name: Sinners
Fortune, fortune, smiling fate
I haven't seen you much of late
Need you now and cannot wait
But wanna look, you're not around
Nevermind in what we do
The night's still good for a gram or two
I'll be drinking late with you
Until the morning comes around
Yeaaah, I must be good for something
Yeaaah, yeaah, yeah
Oh sinners come down, come gather 'round
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobble streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeaaah, I must be good for something
Yeaaah, yeaaah, yeah
Down and out, and out of luck
We're spinning, but the needle 's stuck
Let's go have some fun before
They go and put us in the ground
Lions sit in solemn lines
Drinking gin and dropping lines
Wasting beats in this heart of mine
Until the morning comes around
Yeaaah, I must be good for something
Yeaaah, yeaah
Oh sinners come down, come gather 'round
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobble streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeaaah, I must be good for something
Yeaaah, yeah
Oh sinners come down
Come gather 'round
Have a little fun before they put us in the ground
Yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobble streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeaaah, I must be good for something
Yeaaah, yeah
