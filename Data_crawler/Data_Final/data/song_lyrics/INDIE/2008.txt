Song Name: Australia
Time to put the ear-covers on
No!
La-la-la-laaa
La-la-la-laaa (Laaa)
La-la-la-la
(Born to) Born to multiply?
Born to gaze into night skies?
All you want's one more Saturday
Well, look here until then
They gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters 'til the day
We come in doing cartwheels
We are caught up by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth and gouge my eyes
You'll be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried
Woo, ooh!
A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep 'em folded in your lap
And raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers, just the same
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late
Or changed by a potion
And find a handsome young mate for you to love
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well, do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold
Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dare to be one of us, girl
Faced with the androids conundrum
I felt like I should just cry
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
You're Himmler in your coat, you don't know how long I have been
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the windooow
Lala-la-la-laaa
(La-la-la-la)
Lala-la-la-laaa
(La-la-la-la)
Lala-la-la-laaa
(La-la-la-la)
Lala-la-la-laaa
