Song Name: Strawberry's Wake
I'm lost again
Where have my friends all gone?
Been chasing stars so long that home feels like a distant memory
Guess I can turn my woes into familiar melodies
Hey, I wanna set up shop, reach in and grab that mop
Clean up the past, say I'm sorry
Hey, I wanna eat my fear; fingers, they go in ears
La-la-la liberated
10.000 words cling to photos of memories
Can't tell what hurts, but you know I'm the enemy
Everybody sins, everybody's volatile
Everybody doubts decisions when they're vulnerable
Nobody's perfect, but everyone's searching, I'm sure
Roll the windows down, let the breeze blow heavy
Turn the music loud, let the fever come alive
Gotta feel that sound when the blood pumps steady
Can't drag you down, come alive
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
They say "Don't get caught up in regret, learn from
Everything you've lost, let go of all you've done"
Everybody sins, everybody's volatile
Everybody doubts decisions when they're vulnerable
Nobody's perfect, but everyone's searching, I'm sure
Hey, I wanna set up shop, reach in and grab that mop
Clean up the past, say "I'm sorry"
Hey, I wanna eat my fear; fingers, they go in ears
La-la-la liberated
Roll the windows down, let the breeze blow heavy
Turn the music loud, let the fever come alive
Gotta feel that sound when the blood pumps steady
Can't drag you down, come alive
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
If you feel your feelings, let the feelings heal your fucked up mind
Put your palms to the sky
And if you need some healing, let the feelings open up your mind
Put your palms to the sky
If you feel your feelings, let the feelings heal your fucked up mind
Put your palms to the sky
And if you need some healing, let the feelings open up your mind
Put your palms to the sky
