Song Name: Breezeblocks
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Citrezene, your fevers gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops
(La la la la)
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey
(La la la la)
Break down, now weep
Build up breakfast, now let's eat
My love, my love, love, love
(La la la la)
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take our honey
(La la la la)
Break down, now sleep
Build up breakfast now let's eat
My love, my love, love, love
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
(La la la la)
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love
(La la la la)
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
She may contain the urge to runaway
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germaline, disinfect the scene
My love, my love, love, love
Please don't go
I love you so
My lovely
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart (hey)
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart
Please don't go
(Please don't go) I'll eat you whole
(I'll eat you whole) I love you so
(I love you so) I love you so, I love you so
(I love you so, I love you so) please don't go
(Please don't go) I'll eat you whole
(I'll eat you whole) I love you so
(I love you so)
(I love you so, I love you so) please don't go
(Please don't go) I'll eat you whole
(I'll eat you whole) I love you so
(I love you so) I love you so, I love you so
(I love you so, I love you so) please don't go
(Please don't go) I'll eat you whole
(I'll eat you whole) I love you so
(I love you so)
(I love you so, I love you so) please don't go
(Please don't go) I'll eat you whole
(I'll eat you whole) I love you so
(I love you so) I love you so, I love you so
(I love you so, I love you so) please don't go

I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go
I'll eat you whole
I love you so
I love you so, I love you so
