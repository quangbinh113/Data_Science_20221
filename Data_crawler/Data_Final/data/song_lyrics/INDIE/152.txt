Song Name: imagine if
Ah yeah
Yeah, if I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future and I'd make it alright
Oh, darling, if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind, yeah
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
Imagine if I never messed up
Imagine if we never even broke up (Nope)
Imagine if I had the power to control the voices in my head
And I could tell them all to shut the fuck up (Shut the fuck up)
Imagine if I never told a lie
Imagine if I knew how to always get it right
Imagine if I wasn't such a coward and I had the courage
Hidden somewhere in my heart to look you in the eye, yeah, yeah
If I could go back (Go back)
Just for a night (Yeah)
I would see the future and I'd make it alright
Oh, darling, if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind (Yeah)
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
I was thinkin' like, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday
I wonder if I saw your face again
Would you be a stranger or would we be more than friends?
Would this be the beginning or the long and winding road
That takes us all the way around until the very bitter end?
Imagine if we never felt fear
Imagine we were brave enough to never hide the tears
Imagine if I didn't have to worry about everything around me
And my sanity was actually here (Yeah)
I just got so caught up in the moment
Didn't even realize we were broken
If I could go back (Go back)
Just for a night (Yeah)
I would see the future and I'd make it alright
Oh, darling, if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind, yeah
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
I was thinkin' like, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday
I was thinkin' like, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh, aye-oh, aye okay
Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like, yeah
Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like
But until then, If I could go back (Go back)
Just for a night (Yeah)
I would see the future and I'd make it alright
Oh, darling, if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind, yeah
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
