Song Name: Fear
I never felt it when I was young
I never knew where it came from

Now I feel it like a hurricane
And it's so hard to stop the rain
It's so hard to stop the rain
It's so hard to stop
Starts out gold, but never stays
The neon takes my breath away
And now I feel it in my veins
But I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to live this way
I don't want you to leave
