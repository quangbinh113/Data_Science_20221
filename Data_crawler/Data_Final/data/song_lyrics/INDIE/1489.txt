Song Name: Glass House
Know everything's, know everything's
Know everything's, know everything's at this
Know everything's, know everything's
Know everything's, know everything's at this
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this)
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this)
If nothing's new under the Sun
We can figure it out
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
My mind was made to run for fun
I'ma change up the house
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
Too wild to be certain (too wild to be certain)
No sure things (no sure things)
That never stops the (that never stops the)
Loop life brings (loop life brings)
Same old (know everything's, know everything's)
Same old shit (know everything's, know everything's at this)
Same old (know everything's, know everything's)
Same old (know everything's, know everything's at this) same old
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this)
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this)
Roll the situations (damn)
Found a voice, I made a choice that came with your blessing
Etched interpretations of life
Walk the land with a message in hand
Dap me up then (dap me up then)
Dap me up then (know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
(Know everything's, know everything's) (stomping)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this)
We both know what happens (ah ah)
When you stomp in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's)
Get to stomping in a glass house (know everything's, know everything's at this
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
(Know everything's, know everything's)
(Know everything's, know everything's at this)
