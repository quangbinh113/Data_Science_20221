Song Name: SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY Remix (feat. Kali Uchis and Moliy)
Kali Uchis
Oh, there's dollars all around
Dollar, dollar bills, yeah
Dollar, dollar bills (Kali)
Yeah, you've been staring at me (¿pa' que me mires?)
I don't really know how long now
I feel like there's nothing in my way
All this money on me, it feels amazing
In the Range Rover, I'm racing
Me and your nigga still dating
I don't wanna talk, I'm dancing, dancing
I don't need no fake love, no, I don't need no favor
I know my time gon' come, just me and my make-up
I'm gonna make the paper, I'm gonna make the paper
I'm gonna make dollar bills, I'm gonna get paid, yeah
Get the fuck outta my way, I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid, yeah, just gimme my mula-la-la
Get the fuck outta my way, I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I'm gonna get paid, yeah, just gimme my mula-la-la
I really like to party, I really like to party
I really like to party, I cannot control my body
So, when this song is starting, just cancel all your plans, oh
It's evident in my dancing, moonwalk like Michael Jackson
I really like your body, I really like your body
I don't know why you hide it, I wanna see you behind me
You know you don't gotta lie to me, yo quiero sentirte inside of me
Todo el día imaginándote, lo quiero pa' mí to' la noche
And you know I don't need no favors
You know I don't need no fake love
I'm that bitch on and off for the cameras
Type of bitch few people can handle
And I walk like I know my pussy dangerous
Talk like my words are made of angel dust
When I whisper to you in a couple languages
Lo que quiero, papi, es besos en la espalda pues
Como 100 millón de besos todo el día
That's the only thing que me da alegría
Sabes que yo quiero hacerte cosas sucias
Y quemarte con estas caricias
Tu lengua en todo mi cuerpo
Cuando termines, te quedas por dentro
Tu lengua en todo mi cuerpo
Y cuando termines te quedas por dentro
Get the fuck outta my way, I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid, yeah, just gimme my mula-la-la
Get the fuck outta my way, I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I'm gonna get paid, yeah, just gimme my mula-la-la
I really like to party, I really like your body
I really wanna get naughty, I think you're such a hottie
Slow dancing in the party, oh yes we're making money
Book a flight to Miami, baby, take me out the country
Why you wanna act like Leo?
Like you don't love me please, oh
Like you don't spend money, oh
Like you don't eat my pussy
To the left, to the right
To the front with it, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, that's right
If the money's going up, say yeah, yeah, yeah
