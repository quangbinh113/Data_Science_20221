Song Name: Flowers From Japan
I've been waiting for your call
A call that never comes too soon
Wires crossed I can't get through
Fell asleep on the speed train
Sorry I missed our FaceTime date
Different time zones it was late
Sending flowers from Japan waiting
For you to tell me you're on the flight
High in the skies, singing
We can go
On a one way ticket to Tokyo
See the places you say you want to go
Dreaming of a spring so far from home
Call you up to say please come through
Come through
I hear of Kyoto in the spring
Flowers bloom and the birds sing
Can you be here for morning?
Smell the roses see the sights
Dreaming of Osaka skies
We'll be lovers in the night
Sending flowers from Japan waiting
For you to tell me you're on the flight
High in the skies, singing
We can go
On a one way ticket to Tokyo
See the places you say you want to go
Dreaming of a spring so far from home
And we can go
Wherever you want to take me love
Meeting faces you've never seen before
All I know is that I want you so
I've been up all night to ask you
Ask you
Take a flight to Tokyo
Board the plane and come on through
Sending kisses through the phone
Hope I get to see you soon
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
