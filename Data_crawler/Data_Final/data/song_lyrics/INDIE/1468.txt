Song Name: Haunted
Yeah, do you think it's cute that I'm so fucking stupid?
Tell me that it is, 'cause I'm tired of being useless (Yeah)
I've been up for three days, everything is haunted
Everybody's evil and there's bugs inside the carpet
Do you think I'm frightening? Organ chords and lightning
If I show my fangs, will you tell me that they're cool?
Mirrors shatter when I'm passing, broken glass and crashing
Little blurry stars scattered all across my room
