Song Name: Turning Wheel
Dancing
When you're dancing
Without moving
Without moving
Looking glass of glory
In your eyes
Lay down all your weapons
We don't have to fight
Holy hands of Heaven
A rattled sign
You want to set out for the cities
Turning wheel, but I want to stay up on the hill
Baby, aren't you happy?
I live underground
Attention of the people
Makes me drown
Lay down all your weapons
We don't have to fight
Holy hands of Heaven
A rattled sign
You want to set out for the cities
Turning wheel, but I want to stay up on the hill
You want to set out for the cities
Turning wheel, but I want to stay up on the hill
