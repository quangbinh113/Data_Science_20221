Song Name: Sunburn
You're losing yourself
With the life that you are leading, honey
You're somebody else when you pick up the phone, oh, oh, oh
You're falling apart
Everytime he says he needs you, baby
And please, it's breaking my heart to see you go on, oh, oh, oh
You say my name and the world turns
Hold me in your arms and my heart burns
Like the sunlight
And I can't fight
The way you hypnotize me like you do
I see you rise and my day starts
You tell all your lies and you break hearts
I still need you
'Cause I'm free too
My daydream may be fake
But babe, you are too
You're letting him win
You forgive your man, he smiles and carries on
You're giving it up
You're living a lie, oh
I know, you can't be alone
You would rather what you have than the unknown
You poison yourself, but you're enjoying the show, oh, oh, oh, oh
You say my name and the world turns
Hold me in your arms and my heart burns
Like the sunlight
And I can't fight
The way you hypnotize me like you do
I see you rise and my day starts
You tell all your lies, and you break hearts
I still need you
'Cause I'm free too
My daydream may be fake
But babe, you are too
Love is blind when you are staring at the sun
You close your eyes 'cause you got nowhere to run
When you lose your home
Your heart has nowhere left to turn
Let it burn, let it burn
I'm yours until you've had all your fun
I'm losing myself (I'm losing myself)

You smile, and I get sunburn (sunburn)
