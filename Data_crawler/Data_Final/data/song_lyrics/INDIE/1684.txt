Song Name: FULL TIME LOVER
I'm a full time lover
Yes, I'm undercover (ah)
Yes, she blew my cover (ah)
Under the covers, I'm a full time lover
Lover, yes, I'm a full time lover
Yeah, I'm a full time lover (ah)
Yes, I'm a full time lover
I'm a full, time baby I'm a full time lover
Yeah baby I'm a full time lover
Tell one no part time lover
And my mama really loves her
Tell all the other girls, "I love her"
Uh huh
Yes, I'm a full, time baby I'm a full time lover
Full time lover (lover)
I cannot leave to you
She said that she's having kids
It doesn't get benders, benders
Full time lover (lover)
And I'm a five star lover
I'm friends with your brother
And your grandmother loves me too
Full time lover
I give my love to you
And I just wanna peace (yeah)
No I ain't scary
Come on
Ah
Chill
