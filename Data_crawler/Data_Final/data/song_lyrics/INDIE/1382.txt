Song Name: Baby Teeth
You're trying to play it cool
Just keeping up with your friends
Those summer nights are cruel
When you're in over your head
You try so hard to be the one that you want
Be forever blue
Always like you're coming on way too strong
Either way you lose
You don't have to be a fast lane driver
You don't have to be a deep sea diver
Say, "C'est la vie", you won't ever see clear
From where you are
It ain't that hard
They got gasoline
And count up all of their sins
But you got baby teeth
Don't let 'em under your skin
You try so hard to be the one that you want
Be forever blue
Always like you're coming on way too strong
Either way you lose
You don't have to be a fast lane driver
You don't have to be a deep sea diver
Say, "C'est la vie", you won't ever see clear
From where you are
It ain't that hard
Heaven knows you're not a born survivor
You'll get older but you won't get wiser
Say, "C'est la vie", you won't ever see clear
From where you are
It ain't that hard
You try so hard
You always try so hard
Ha, ah-ah
You don't have to be a fast lane driver
You don't have to be a deep sea diver
Say, "C'est la vie", you won't ever see clear
From where you are
It ain't that hard
Ha, ah-ah
Heaven knows you're not a born survivor
You'll get older but you won't get wiser
Say, "C'est la vie", you won't ever see clear
From where you are
It ain't that hard
