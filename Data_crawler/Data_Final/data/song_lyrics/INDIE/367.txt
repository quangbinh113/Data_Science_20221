Song Name: Intertwined
Skin
Heat
Hair in your mouth
Feet touching feet
Oh you
And I
Safe from the world
Though the world will try
Oh, I'm afraid of the things in my brain
But we can stay here
And laugh away the fear
Numb
Fine
You create a rarity of my genuine smiles
So breathe
Breathe with me
Can you drink all my thoughts
Cause I can't stand them
Ooh, oh
O-oh, oh, oh
Intertwined
Free
I've pinned each and every hope on you
I hope you don't bleed with me
I'm afraid of the things in my brain
But we can stay here
And laugh away the fear
Hmm, hmm
Hmhmm
