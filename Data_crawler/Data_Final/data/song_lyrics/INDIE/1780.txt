Song Name: move
Yeah, we insane thinking maybe that it's all good
Coming back around, making all the shit feel good, it could
Make you wanna move 'til you can't breathe
Got me messin' in my jammies and I can't sleep, yeah
Stuck in a nine-to-five
Caught up but this shit's a waste of time
Ain't got the appetite
Tossing and turning, it don't feel right
You, me, we outta here
Take me away, in your atmosphere
Lights out I'm gone tonight
Movin' to places 'til I feel like
I'm floating high up outer space
Feel my legs getting looser
My mind's open to the future
This feeling I just can't replace
Hear it burning up inside now
And I'm outta time
Just move baby
Put on your shoes baby
Get on the news baby
We're on the loose, hey-ay
I'm ready to move weight
Got no excuse baby
I'm over the moon baby
Ain't nothing to lose, hey
Yeah, we insane thinking maybe that it's all good
Coming back around, making all the shit feel good, it could
Make you wanna move 'til you can't breathe
Got me messin' in my jammies and I can't sleep, yeah
Take you to paradise
Gotta be movin', just dont think twice
No time to compromise
Looking for reasons to feel alive
Two, three, hundred degrees
We on a mission to disappear
Remember to hold on tight
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride
I'm floating high up outer space
Feel my legs getting looser
My mind's open to the future
This feeling I just can't replace
Hear it burning up inside now
And I'm outta time
Just move baby
Put on your shoes baby
Get on the news baby
We're on the loose, hey-ay
I'm ready to move weight
Got no excuse baby
I'm over the moon baby
Ain't nothing to lose, hey
Yeah, we insane thinking maybe that it's all good
Coming back around, making all the shit feel good, it could
Make you wanna move 'til you can't breathe
Got me messin' in my jammies and I can't sleep, yeah
