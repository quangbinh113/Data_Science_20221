Song Name: Uncomfortable
Driving away
I wish I'd stay
Another night
Hasn't changed
And now I see
It's you, not me
Who needs the time
You can't find any more
I never wanted love
But now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time
You see, I care
But now it's fading fast
Thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable
But I feel so uncomfortable
The pieces fit
Perspective hits
You realize everything is the same
You say the same lines
I'll die on my time
As it goes on
I will be gone
I never wanted love
But now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time
You see, I care
But now it's fading fast
Thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable
But I feel so uncomfortable
When the memories bend
I'll see you at the end
And if they never fade
I won't be far away
I never wanted love
But now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time
You see, I care
But now it's fading fast
Thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable
But I feel so uncomfortable
