Song Name: Suicide Letter
The pain I got inside got me feeling so numb, oh yeah
The drugs that I been on got my heart beat like a drum, oh yeah
The demons that I fight, they been coming for my soul, oh yeah
I've been tryna run but I'm moving to slow, oh yeah
I shut everyone out 'cause I wanna be alone, oh yeah
I've been in my room, I've been counting down the time
Counting down the hours 'till I finally take my life
I don't wanna feel this pain anymore, oh yeah
I've been feeling worthless baby, I've been out my mind
Ask me how I'm doing, but I tell you I've been fine
Truth is I don't wanna be alive anymore, oh yeah
Speeding down the freeway, I been driving way too fast
Swerving 'round the corner and I'm hoping that I crash
Baby, I don't want you to be sad when I'm gone, no, yeah
This is just a letter to my family and my fans
I guess I ain't happy with the person that I am
Can't talk about it lately so I put it in a song, oh yeah
Speeding down the freeway, I been driving way too fast
Swerving 'round the corner and I'm hoping that I crash
Baby, I don't want you to be sad when I'm gone, no, yeah
This is just a letter to my family and my fans
I guess I ain't happy with the person that I am
Can't talk about it lately so I put it in a song, oh yeah
