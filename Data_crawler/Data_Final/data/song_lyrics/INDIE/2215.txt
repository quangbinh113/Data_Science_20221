Song Name: rest up
All by myself, 4:30 a.m.
Why can't I sleep now?
I feel the urge to call you again
I know it's not real, just stuck on repeat
I'm sorry, but I never intended
To put this weight on you
But, honey, I...
Darling, I'm trying to get better
I keep forgetting these things that are important to me
Darkness gets stuck on my mind
And I get blinded
I wish I could get a break, so I can rest up
And I could finally see what really matters to me
Woke up again
What can I do to get my shit together?
I thought the nights were made for sleeping tight
They just blind my sight
In my head, I fight
Such a waste of time, yeah
I keep forgetting these things that are important to me
Darkness gets stuck on my mind
And I get blinded
I wish I could get a break, so I can rest up
And I could finally see what really matters to me
But, honey, I...
Darling, I'm trying to get better

Darling, I...
Honey, I'm trying to get better
