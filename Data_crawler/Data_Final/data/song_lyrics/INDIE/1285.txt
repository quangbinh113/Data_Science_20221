Song Name: circle the drain
I wanna be calm like the soft summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders
But everything just brings me back down to the cold hard ground
And it keeps getting colder
It's a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame but I'm not sure I'm able
I'm wobbling out on the wire and the lights could go out
With the break of a cable
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I'm going down
I'm trying to seem strong for my love, for my family and friends
But I'm so tired of faking
'Cause I'm chained to my bed when they're gone
Watching tv alone until my body starts aching
And I think there's a mold in my brain
Spreading down all the way through my heart and my body
'Cause I cling to the dark of my room
And the days thin me out of just burn me straight through
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I'm going down
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open watching my heart go round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I'm going down
Round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I'm going down
