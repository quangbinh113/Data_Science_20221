Song Name: Attention
Oh, I want your attention
Want it only to shine down on me
Beautiful feeling on my own two feet
In the garden I'm chilling
In the morning I'll cool off my brain
Evenings are humid all the time I wait
You know I want your attention
Even if it's a long way from home
Mutual feeling in my sea, my stone
Disavow an allusion
Then you walk it around for a long time
All an illusion for that evil eye
