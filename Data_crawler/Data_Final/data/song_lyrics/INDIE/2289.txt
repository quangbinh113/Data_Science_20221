Song Name: Tainted Love
Sometimes I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my life
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
Tainted love
Now, I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
Tainted love
Don't touch me, please, I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love
