Song Name: E-GIRLS ARE RUINING MY LIFE!
Choke me, like you hate me
But you love me
Lowkey wanna date me
When you fuck me
Touch me with the lights off, and my chains on
Baby, I'm not the right one you should wait on
She's a freak, lil' bad hoe
Gaspare told me kill it, I said lemme grab my death note
She pull me in, like a lasso
Sayin' that she know me, I don't even know her though
Ain't no daddy issues, then I won't even bother
She say I kill her cat, like I'm Luka Magnotta
Real bad bitch, pussy bald like Saitama
They used to hate me, now they want me
Bitch, I feel like I'm Gaara
Girl, you fuckin' with the wrong one
Fuck his team, fuck your clique, bitch I'm on one
Fuck your stream, fuck your clip, you ain't saw one
Got your bitch on my dick, like she want one
She got death notes
Dead souls
Split dye
Chain cold
Think I fell in love when she said grab me by the neck tho'
All through the night
Colder than ice
Man I swear these goth girls really finna fuck up my life
Bat wing fly
Like the moon in the sky
She just looking through my soul with those Shinigami eyes
Coke in my nose
And a blade on her thigh
Man, I think this girl is really tryna plan my demise
It's the Pumpkin Patch King
With the corpse with the ring
And she would fuck my best friend if I died here today
Choke me, like you hate me
But you love me
Lowkey wanna date me
When you fuck me
Touch me with the lights off, and my chains on
Baby, I'm not the right one you should wait on
