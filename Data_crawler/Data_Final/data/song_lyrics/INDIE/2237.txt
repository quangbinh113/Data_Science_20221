Song Name: The Dark
Pale moonlight, diamond skies
Such a fine line
Such a fine way to live your life
All my crimes
Lose my mind
Such a bad sign when you find what you really like
When we're alone
And the dark comes to take control
In the light of your eyes
And I don't want to let you go
'Cause I won't win the fight
We can watch from your bedroom window
We can watch all night
When the dark comes to take control
We can be the light
Won't you shine
Don't pick sides
Hard to find time, hard to find time to live the lie
I can't show
What I don't know
I can rewind
It's a crime that I never mind
When we're alone
And the dark comes to take control
In the light of your eyes
And I don't want to let you go
'Cause I won't win the fight
We can watch from your bedroom window
We can watch all night
When the dark comes to take control
We can be the light
Ah, we are darkness
We are darkness
To the light
We are darkness
We are darkness
To the light
We are darkness
We are darkness
To the light
To the light
To the light
And the dark comes to take control
In the light of your eyes
And I don't want to let you go
'Cause I won't win the fight
We can watch from your bedroom window
We can watch all night
When the dark comes to take control
We can be the light
And the dark comes to take control
In the light of your eyes (we are darkness, we are darkness)
And I don't want to let you go
'Cause I won't win the fight (we are darkness, we are darkness)
