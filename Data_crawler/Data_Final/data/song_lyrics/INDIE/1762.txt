Song Name: So Good
I see you working your magic
Oh, won't you put on a show?
You turn my love into madness
I know I said I would go
I wanted to know what led you to find me
I'm under your hold, I need you to guide me
How you so cold when the sun is so blinding?
I wanted to know
Did you really mean it when you said you love me?
You got me so good
I can't escape the feeling, when you said you love me
You got me so good
So good (so good, yeah), so good (so good, yeah)
So good (so good, yeah), so good (so good, yeah)
So, did you really mean it when you said you love me?
You got me so good
Down, baby, down, baby
You ran me right, right through the ground baby, ground, baby
I never wanted you around, baby, 'round, baby
And now you're nowhere to be found
I wanted to know what led you to find me
I'm under your hold, I need you to guide me
How you so cold when the sun is so blinding?
I wanted to know
Did you really mean it when you said you love me?
You got me so good
I can't escape the feeling, when you said you love me
You got me so good
So good (so good, yeah), so good (so good, yeah)
So good (so good, yeah), so good (so good, yeah)
So, did you really mean it when you said you love me?
You got me so good
