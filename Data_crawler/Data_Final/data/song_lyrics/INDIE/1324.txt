Song Name: Baby Tonight
My head is killing me tonight
I didn't get to sleep last night
I'm rushing to get that girl
But I am just not her type
She doesn't like my shaggy hair
Or any of the clothes I wear
I'm cocky and I'm fucking up
But baby, that was just my love
Baby, it was just my love
Baby, it was just my love
Baby, it was just my love
She's a diamond in my fucked up world
Prettier than the pearls
That lay around on her neck
She makes me so fucking sick
I wanna just touch her skin
Maybe she could pull me in
Baby, can you make me whole?
Baby, can you crush my soul?
Baby, can you crush my soul?
Baby, can you crush my soul?
Baby, can you crush my soul?
She's pushing me to the edge
Shaking up my head
I wanna go punch the wall
I hope to God I don't fall
She could've been my paradise
Now I gotta sacrifice
'Cause my head's killing me tonight
So, baby, won't you take my life?
Or maybe you could crush my soul?
Baby, it was just my love
So, baby, won't you crush my soul?
Or maybe you could take my life?
Or maybe you could crush my soul?
