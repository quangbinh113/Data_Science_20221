Song Name: Pope Is a Rockstar
Now he wants to start talking
"Go ahead," when I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
"No, don't wanna, won't happen"

Pope is a rockstar
You take your clothes off
Heading for the last fight
Before our worlds part
We can wait forever for the world to untrack
We can wait forever for the worthwhile track
And oh, you want to start talking
Fall together, I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
We can always fight
You can be the highlight
Pope is a rockstar
Hoping on a late night
How you wanna start talking?
How you wanna start walking?
We can make a landslide, dive-in
We can let it all go, cave-in
(EL)
You wanna start talking
(EL)
You know what I'm walking
Hoping and a-hoping that I won't cry
Hoping and a-hoping that I won't try
