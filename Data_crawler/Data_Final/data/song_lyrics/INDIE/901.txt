Song Name: See You
I was with my friends
We missed the last train
Ran into your friends
And they pretended
Like nothing had changed
Like everything's alright
I shoulda texted
Before I called you
I sent you a message
Maybe you missed it
Or it never went through
But it's been one of those nights
Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish but
I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you been lately
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon
But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once
And I just wanna see you
Nobody said this
Would ever be easy
The way that we left it
Would have such an influence on me
Wish I could turn back time
Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish, but
I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you been lately
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon
But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once
And I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you (darlin' I, I just wanna see you)
Baby, I, yeah I just wanna see you
Yeah, I just wanna see you
Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish, but
I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you been lately (I do)
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon
But you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I in love once
And I just wanna see you

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
