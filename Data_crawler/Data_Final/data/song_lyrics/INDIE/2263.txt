Song Name: Hey
Hey, been trying to meet you
Hey, must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door
Whore in my bed
But hey!
Where have you been?
If you go, I will surely die
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
Chained
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
Uh, said the man to the lady
"Uh, said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir: Uh-uh
All night
And Mary, ain't you tired of this?
Uh, is the sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
(Chained) We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
