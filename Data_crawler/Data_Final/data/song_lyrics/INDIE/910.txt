Song Name: Sad Fuck
I'm a sad fuck
Self-sabotage, and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah
But I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I'm never good enough, yeah
I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Yeah
I have bad nights, but I'm not a bad guy (duh)
Billie Eilish, "I'ma make your mama sad" type
And I've been doing well, but I get overwhelmed
As soon as I compare myself to everybody else
Why's it always when I close my eyes?
Overthinking and I don't know why
I'm not saying that I hate my life
I just wish that I was happy sometimes 'cause
I'm a sad fuck
Self-sabotagе and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah
But I don't always wanna bе a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I'm never good enough, yeah
I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
(Yeah, yeah)
(Always say I'm gonna change)
I never do, everything is overdue
(Runnin' late, everyday)
Overthinking every move (hey!)
Whatcha sad for, who you feeling bad for?
(Why you so upset)
When you got everything you asked for?
Ain't it funny how they think I'm fine
Just 'cause I got everything they see online?
Now, I'm not saying that I hate my life
I just wish that I was happy sometimes 'cause
I'm a sad fuck
Self-sabotage, and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah
But I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I'm never good enough, yeah
I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Self-sabotage and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah
But I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I'm never good enough, yeah
I don't always wanna be a sad fuck
