Song Name: Choirs
In the champagne drought, I lost my mind
So I started smoking cigarettes with boxed wine
When I made a sound, my neighbors cried
Said all my songs sound just like drunken lullabies
Said I couldn't change, so I broke the mold
And I put my dreams in bottles knowing they would float
To a better place where I could be myself
Don't wanna be another blonde doll on the shelf
Every day all day
Every day all day
Ah-a, ah-a-ah-a
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head
And I like to think they're all my friends
When I fall apart they put me back together again
It's like they see and understand
Every day, all day, every day when
People show their teeth, don't bite your tongue
Baby, you're a diamond shining with no lights on
If it gives you peace, keep raising hell
Every day all day
Every day all day
Ah-a, ah-a-ah-a
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head
Ah-a, ah-a-ah-a
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head
I finally got what I wanted
Yeah, I think that I found the way
I finally got what I needed
With the voices I have in my brain
Ah-a, ah-a-ah-a
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head
