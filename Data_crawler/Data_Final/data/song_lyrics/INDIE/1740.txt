Song Name: Stargazing
Take it from the top
If I start, I just can't stop
All the patience that I've got
It's not enough to save me
It's a race against the clock
But we don't wanna watch
Keep runnin' 'til we're lost
You got me thinkin'
Pull it out of park, put it in drive
I can feel your heart beatin' with mine
Underneath the stars, lookin' for a sign
Glowin' in the dark 'til the sun shines
Made it pretty far on the first try
Might've set the bar a little too high
Started with a spark, now we're on fire
Started with a spark
Ooh, baby
You take me on a ride
Gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, baby
I feel like we've made it pretty far
Now we're stargazin'
Push until it pops
Tryna clear my thoughts
Better keep the AC on for me
Not enough, yeah
Windows start to fog
Clothin' coming off
Makin' it too hot
You got me thinkin'
Pull it out of park, put it in drive
I can feel your heart beatin' with mine
Underneath the stars, lookin' for a sign
Glowin' in the dark 'til the sun shines
Made it pretty far on the first try
Might've set the bar a little too high, yeah
Started with a spark, now we're on fire
Ooh, baby
You take me on a ride
Gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, baby
I feel like we've made it pretty far
Now we're stargazin'
Ooh, baby
I feel like we've made it pretty far
