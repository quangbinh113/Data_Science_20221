Song Name: ur so pretty
(Sorry, have I injured you?)
(Okay)
You're so pretty
When you smile, it kills me, oh
Can't stop thinking 'bout the way you kissed me
Under the stars
And you're so lovely
When you cry, it hurts me, oh
You're the only person left so hold me
Don't leave me
I'm so scared that the moments we shared
Won't happen again
I don't want this to end
'Cause you're so pretty
When you smile, it kills me, oh
You're the only person left so hold me
Don't leave me
