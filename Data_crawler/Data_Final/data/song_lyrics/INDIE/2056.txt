Song Name: Starting Over
When I was a young girl
When I was younger
I meet a boy like you
We would've fought like enemies
Through my heart wove a fence
Never thought I'd make it painful
If I could only I knew
If I only knew I'd starting over
(Ohh-ahh)
Those are memories, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be waiting, ohh-ahh)
I've been wasting your time
That's when I nothing in your madness
You thought I was crazy
In seven different ways
No, I'm never crazy for you
You're the monster in my life
Hurry up, I'm leaving
You have one foot in the grave
One foot in the grave, what were you thinking?
(Ohh-ahh)
Those are memories, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be waiting, ohh-ahh)
I've been wasting your time
(Ohh-ahh)
Those are memories, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be watching, ohh-ahh)
It might hit, come back again, come back and get it over
(I'll be waiting, ohh-ahh)
I've been wasting your time
Be careful what you wish for
Cause it might come true
These wise words you once said:
"It only takes a moment
To fall in love again"
