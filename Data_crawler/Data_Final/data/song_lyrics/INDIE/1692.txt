Song Name: Wish Upon A Star
Send me a wish so
I can look upon a star
Wonder what you're doing
At this time of night oh
Write me a letter
Of our times together
Written in cursive
Oh how much I miss your hands
Today I saw you again
In the cafeteria
You wore that sweater I liked
But I know it didn't matter
Oh why oh why oh why oh why
Oh why oh why oh why
If you're out there listening to this
I want you to know that I
I wrote this for you
Give me a kiss so
I can remember it all
Give me one last hug
And I will let you go
If you are out there
Listening to this
I want you to know
This tune is for you
