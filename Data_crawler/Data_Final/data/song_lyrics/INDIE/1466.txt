Song Name: Exploding House
Home is where the heart is
I'm afraid of the world
'Cause I don't know what it might do
And I'm terrified of you
Because you're more than I can bear to lose
I love to push back
'Cause I hate you for knowing I'm wrong
And I'm terrified to say that these walls will never come down
Yeah
I'm falling on my ass
'Cause some aren't meant to leave the nest
Oh, some aren't meant to leave the nest
Some love for what may bе
I love for what is there
This housе is freezing cold these days
Photographs burning down
This house is all that I have left
And I can feel it breaking apart
What am I to do?
What am I?
What am I to do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
