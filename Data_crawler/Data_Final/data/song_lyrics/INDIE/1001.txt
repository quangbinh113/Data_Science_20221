Talking to the moon

Tryna get to you

Talking to the moon

Tryna get to you
Temptations, it's knocking on your door
And you're waiting on me baby (on me, woah)
Won't you hold me close?
Baby, I'll go wherever you go
Even if it means that I'm on the road tonight
And I don't, need all your company
Baby, you can't get enough of me
I wait for you, you wait for me tonight
Baby, take my hand
I promise we'll be fine
'Cause baby, I am yours
And baby you are mine
But baby trust me again
And baby we'll be fine
And now she's walking
And I don't understand, baby, why can't you
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Temptations
It's knocking on your door
And I'm waiting
For you, for you
