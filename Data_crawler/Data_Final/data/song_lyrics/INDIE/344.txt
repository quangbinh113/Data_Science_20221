Song Name: I Couldn't Be More In Love
At the best of times
I'm lonely in my mind
But I can find something to show you
If you have got the time
Why would I rely
On the things that I did right?
She said, "I gave you four years of my life"
So
What about
These feelings I've got?
We got it wrong
And you said you'd had enough
What about
These feelings I've got?
I couldn't be
More in love
I could have been a great line
I could have been a sign
Or overstay my time
Say what's on your mind
Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
Because I'd give you all the years of my life
So
What about
These feelings I've got?
We got it wrong
And you said you'd had enough
But what about
These feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love
And what about
These feelings I've got? (Ooh)
We got it wrong
And you said you'd had enough
But what about
These feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love
