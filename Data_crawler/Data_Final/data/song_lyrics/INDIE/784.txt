Song Name: Panic Attacks in Paradise
Typical of me to go and ruin the party
Everybody says they love me, but I'm still brokenhearted
They call me Polly Pessimism, I'm a ma-macabre Barbie (I love you)
My boyfriend wants to love me, but I won't let him
I've been predisposed to trauma since I was 11
So I wrote a couple albums to let out some aggression
I hate that I'm so
Self-deprecating, more comfortable in bad situations
Sucker for a little devastation
And this always happens
Panic attacks in paradise
Piña coladas, I'm terrified
I swear I'm not cryin', the sun's just bright
I'm havin' the best time of my life
Panic attacks in paradise
Hyperventilating under candy skies
Tellin' myself that this is fine
I'm havin' the best time of my life
It's a big joke
Ha ha, I love laughin'
It's a big hoax
Your self-help happy
'Cause I'm okay
I'm pure propane
On an open flame
Watch me blow up
My boyfriend wants to love me but I won't let him
I've been predisposed to trauma since I was 11
So I wrote a couple albums to let out some aggression
I hate that I'm so
Self-deprecating, more comfortable in bad situations
Sucker for a little devastation
And this always happens
Panic attacks in paradise
Piña coladas, I'm terrified
I swear I'm not cryin', the sun's just bright
I'm havin' the best time of my life
Panic attacks in paradise
Hyperventilating under candy skies
Tellin' myself that this is fine
I'm havin' the best time of my life
