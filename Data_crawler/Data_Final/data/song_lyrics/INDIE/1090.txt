Song Name: Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)
She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes and nobody knows like me
She talks kinda lazy
And people say she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes and nobody knows like me
There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine and I just gotta say, "Hey"
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well that I can't get away
I'm a lucky fella
And I've just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes and nobody knows like me
There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine and I just gotta say, "Hey"
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well that I can't get away

I'm a lucky fella and I've just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes and nobody knows like me
It keeps growing every place she's been and nobody knows like me
If you've met her, you'll never forget her and nobody knows like me
La, la, la, believe it when you've seen it
Nobody knows like me...
