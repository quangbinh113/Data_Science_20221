Song Name: Cheers
You came here to welcome me
To what is the end
You said if we weren't in love
We'd still be best friends
We both tell the same jokes
Over and over
Wonder if we'll get married
Before my brother
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me
I like your songs even though
They're not about me
Sometimes I'm scared to show my dad
'Cause you're always cussing
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me
