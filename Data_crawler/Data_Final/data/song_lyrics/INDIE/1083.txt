Song Name: Big Sad
Please give me the one love
Please don't leave, I'm begging
I cannot be by myself
Can I go to heaven even though I put you through hell, hell?
I think I might be too drunk to tell, tell
If I wanna live or kill myself, self, self, self, self
I love the way you break me, oh it's so contagious
Break my heart 'cause you know I can take it
Don't say sorry, 'cause I know you're faking
Just admit that you made a mistake
I remember when you kissed me, we were listening to ultralight beam
And we thought that it would be so easy but Chance's verse ends so quickly, hey, hey
After loving you I'm kinda drained, drained
Wonder if I'll ever be the same, same, same, same, same
I love the way you break me, oh it's so contagious
Break my heart 'cause you know I can take it
Don't say sorry, 'cause I know you're faking
Just admit that you made a mistake
Big sad for you
Can't believe I'm big sad for you
Can't believe I'm big sad for you
I love the way you break me, oh it's so contagious
Break my heart 'cause you know I can take it
Don't say sorry, 'cause I know you're faking
Just admit that...
I love the way you break me, oh it's so contagious
Break my heart 'cause you know I can chase it
Won't say sorry, 'cause I know you're faking
Just admit that you made a mistake
