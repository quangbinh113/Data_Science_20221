Song Name: all the kids are depressed
How long have you been smiling?
It seems like it's been too long
Some days I don't feel like trying
So what the fuck are you on
Whoa, ohh
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling in love like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
Ohh-oh-oh
Noo-oo-oo
Ohh-oh-oh...
So I guess we're scared
Ohh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh
But I can't really keep lyin' (lyin')
'Cause I've been scared all along (all along)
I'm getting sick of sleeping in
While all my friends are popping pills, and
I don't think that they're wrong, woah, oh
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling apart like it's just nothing
I want to know, where do we go
When nothing's wrong
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
Ohh-oh-oh
Noo-oo-oo
Ohh-oh-oh...
So I guess we're scared
I won't deny it 'cause you saw what it was
I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck
So I'll throw it out
You know I am so in love
