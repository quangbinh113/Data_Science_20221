Song Name: Groceries
Real sorry about your broken heart
I'm tryin' to walk on broken glass
Do it all again for art
Like had to write a song about it
I'll go if you'll go, if you're cool with that
I'll go if you'll go, I have hope that you'll know that
I'll go if you'll go, if you're cool with that
I'll go if you'll go, I have hope that you'll know that
I just wanna get groceries
I'll pray that you wanna get close to me
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time
But I think that we're supposed to be
And if you wanna get groceries
And if you wanna get close to me
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign
I think that we're supposed to be
I wish that I could let it pass
I don't mind that you put it last
I made it worse, I put you first
We're laughin' like it didn't hurt
I'm in the dirt, I'll make it work though
I'll go if you'll go, if you're cool with that
I'll go if you'll go, I have hope that you'll know that
I'll go if you'll go, if you're cool with that
I'll go if you'll go, I have hope that you'll know that
I just wanna get groceries
I'll pray that you wanna get close to me
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time
But I think that we're supposed to be
And if you wanna get groceries
And if you wanna get close to me
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign
I think that we're supposed to be
I just wanna get groceries
I'll pray that you wanna get close to me
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time
But I think that we're supposed to be
And if you wanna get groceries
And if you wanna get close to me
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign
I think that we're supposed to be
This sucks, I'm lovesick, too important to rush this
I'd miss our kiss if it ever left my lips
No one I know is stickin' on my mind when I go
Except ya, but you're just friends with Miss Independent
And this sucks, I'm lovesick, too important to rush this
I'd miss our kiss if it ever left my lips
No one I know is stickin' on my mind when I go
Heart broke, but I spend it 'cause I'm Miss Independent
I just wanna get groceries
I'll pray that you wanna get close to me
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time
But I think that we're supposed to be
And if you wanna get groceries
And if you wanna get close to me
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign
I think that we're supposed to be
I just wanna get groceries
I'll pray that you wanna get close to me
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time
But I think that we're supposed to be
And if you wanna get groceries
And if you wanna get close to me
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign
I think that we're supposed to be
