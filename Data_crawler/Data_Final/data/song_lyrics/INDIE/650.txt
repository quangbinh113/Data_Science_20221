Song Name: Bust Your Knee Caps - Johnny Don't Leave Me
Johnny, don't leave me
You said you'd love me forever
Honey, believe me
I'll have your heart on a platter
Might you recall
We've got a small family business
And the family won't like this
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh wop de do wop de do
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh wop de do wop de do
Johnny, you told me
You were no fool, you were no chump
Then you got cold feet
Now all you'll be is a speed bump
It's something we call
Oh, just a small family business
And the family won't like this
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh wop de do wop de do
They'll bust your knee caps
That's what they're going to do
Johnny, there's still time
Together I know, we'd go so far
I'll tell uncle Rocco
To call off the guys with the crowbars
You call it crime
We call it smart family business
And the family is famous
Bust your knee caps
Bust your knee caps
It's such a shame
That you became such an issue
Oh dear Johnny, I'll miss you
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh wop de do wop de do
They'll bust your knee caps
That's what they're going to do
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh wop de do wop de do
They'll bust your knee caps
Ooh yeah they're coming for you
Bust your knee caps
Ooh, bust your knee caps
Bust your knee caps
Ooh, bust your knee caps
