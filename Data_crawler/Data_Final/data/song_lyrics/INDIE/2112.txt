Song Name: the perfect pair
You ought to know that I think we're one and the same
But don't think we could help it, no, don't think we could help it
We don't talk much, guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it, and I'm so tired of fighting
If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I wouldn't anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can take
I know you hate it when there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it, guess we're so used to it
Wish I had known this from the beginning
We find it hard to work out why we have all this doubt
If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can take
