Song Name: Sorry You Didn't Get to Kiss That Boy You Wanted to Kiss
Cigarette ash in my corduroy
She's telling me, I'm nothing but a sad boy
I'm not expensive, I'm worthless
And I can't speak any german
What's the point?
Sick of waiting up all night
Just to see if you would sleep by my side
Shaking in your skin, you're upset when the drugs start kicking in
Don't you realize that you played me like a game?
It's a shame
When I stepped off the front stoop of that house
All of the alcohol I swallowed came out
There you were, there was he
Just something I knew that I would see
