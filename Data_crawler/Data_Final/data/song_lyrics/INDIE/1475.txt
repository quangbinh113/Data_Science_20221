Song Name: American Beauty
When she talks about it, she bites her lip
Taste of chamomile honey reel me in
Maybe I wanna show you what it's like
And baby, you're so pretty, we should keep the lights on
Baby, you're so pretty, we should keep the lights on
American beauty, you tell me just what you like and I'll listen
Whisper it to me
They can't keep you satisfied but I'll listen
American beauty, you tell me just what you like and I'll listen
Whisper it to me
They can't keep you satisfied but I'll listen
Feel her hands roll down and she grips my hip
I've got superpowers in my fingertips
Maybe I wanna show you what it's like
And baby, you're so pretty, we should keep the lights on
American beauty, you tell me just what you like and I'll listen
Whisper it to me
They can't keep you satisfied but I'll listen
American beauty, you tell me just what you like and I'll listen
Whisper it to me
They can't keep you satisfied but I'll listen
