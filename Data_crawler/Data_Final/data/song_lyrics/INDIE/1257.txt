Song Name: Almeda
Hol' up
Pour my drank, drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Pull that Lac on 'em
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor, brown liquor
Brown skin, brown face
Brown leather, brown sugar
Brown leaves, brown keys
Brown creepers, brown face
Black skin, black braids
Black waves, black days
Black baes, black things
These are black-owned things
Black faith still can't be washed away
Not even in that Florida water
Not even in that Florida water
In that Florida water
So pour more drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
I pour my drank on 'em
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor, brown sugar, brown face
Brown liquor, brown sugar, brown braids
Black skin, black Benz, black plays
Black molasses, blackberry the masses
Just sitting here fooling around
We just sitting here cooling around
We just sitting here high, coming down
Pour my drank on 'em (baby, my mind fuzzy)
Sip, sip, sip, sip (baby, my mind fuzzy) sip
Still can't be washed away
Not even in that Florida water (doing the dash)
So, pour my drank (doing the dash)
Sip (doing the dash), sip, sip, sip, sip (doing the dash) sip
Brown liquor, brown sugar, brown face
Brown liquor, brown sugar, brown face
Black skin, black Benz, black plays
Black molasses, blackberry the masses
(Oh, whoa) Just sitting here fooling around (what?)
(Oh, yeah) We just sitting here cooling around (what?)
(Whoa) We just sitting here high, coming down
