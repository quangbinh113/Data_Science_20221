Song Name: Real Estate
I still find your hair in my bed and my clothes
In my mouth, in my nose, oh who knows
If you'll still be there when it's all said and done
Or if I'll just find less from now on
Every time I wonder how I'd carry on without you
I'm running out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you
You, you
I still have no windows in my room or my halls
I was hoping I could look through yours
Sitting in a chair next to your front door
As I watch you do your makeup on the floor
Every time I wonder how I'd carry on without you
I'm running out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you
You, you, you
I'm running out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you
I'm running out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you
You, you, you, you
