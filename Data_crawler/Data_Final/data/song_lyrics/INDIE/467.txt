Song Name: my boy
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy love's his friends like I love my split ends
And by that I mean...
He cuts em' off
(What?!)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's bein' sus, and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father
(Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean
He said he'd change
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my, my boy, my boy
I love, loveâ€“
I, I love, love my split ends
My boy, my, my boy, my friends
I love, love, love, love, love, love, love
"Alright, dude, go trip over a knife"
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want me to be yours, well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours, well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
