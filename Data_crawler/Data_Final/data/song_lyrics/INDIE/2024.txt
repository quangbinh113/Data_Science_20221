Song Name: Peach Pit
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go?
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home
Not much is hidden underneath
A rocky heart for breaking teeth
And apple cores cyanide seed
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
Lift back and see the darkness hid
Swallowed up and angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim

Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go?
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
