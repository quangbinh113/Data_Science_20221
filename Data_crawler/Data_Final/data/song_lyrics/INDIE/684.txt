Song Name: No Brainer
Uh, yo
Uh, yo
This is it, this is all you ever wanted
This is all because you want to say you done it
Now you mixing with the greatest, laughing, "ha-ha-ha-ha"
Now you're laced with all the ladies, now it's na-ah-ah-ah-not
He's a ride or die, I ride his face forever
Tip me over, I like all types of pressure
Tippy-top, tip me over, now it's "oh my, oh my god"
Future butter like it's solar, now it's always summertime
Tell me what you need
Tell it to my manager, he'll tell you, "pay a fee"
Ooh, I fuck it up, I can't wait for you to see
You said your girlfriend wanna marry you
But now she's here with me
I say, it's a no brainer now
Now I'm in this bitch vibrator now
Now I'm making waves and craters now
Tell me, tell me, who's gonna restrain me now?
I say, it's a no brainer now
Now I'm in this bitch vibrator now
Now I'm making waves and craters now
Tell me, tell me, who's gonna restrain me now?
Who's who? Who's made it? Who's nameless?
You still taught the same shit, talking out your anus
You big head, you're brainless
You skidmarks, I'm stainless
I'm fresh out of patience, I'm sick of all the sameness
I'm not in your circle, baby
I'm hot like a thermal, baby
And I'm a controversial lady
I'm popping like a kernel lately
Tell me what you need
Tell it to my manager, he'll tell you, "pay a fee"
Ooh, I fuck it up, I can't wait for you to see
You said your girlfriend wanna marry you
But now she's here with me
I say, it's a no brainer now
Now I'm in this bitch vibrator now
Now I'm making waves and craters now
Tell me, tell me, who's gonna restrain me now?
I say, it's a no brainer now
Now I'm in this bitch vibrator now
Now I'm making waves and craters now
Tell me, tell me, who's gonna restrain me now?
Uh, yo
Uh, yo
