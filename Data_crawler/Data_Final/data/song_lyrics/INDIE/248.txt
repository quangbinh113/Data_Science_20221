Song Name: Nova Scotia 500
On a field trip
I grew some legs
Climbed up Cadillac Mountain
Dove in Frenchman Bay
On a porcupine island
Saw a body laying
In a sandy coffin
Riding Atlantic waves
On a field trip
I grew some legs
Climbed up Cadillac Mountain
Dove in Frenchman Bay
On a porcupine island
Saw a body laying
In a sandy coffin
Riding Atlantic waves
Nova Scotia bones
I found them all alone
Nobody knows
I just found me some gold
Nova Scotia bones
I found them all alone
Nobody knows
I just found me some gold
