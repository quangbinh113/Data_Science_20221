Song Name: San Francisco
I've been in love with love
And the idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I've seen some time tell tales about that systematic drug
Yeah, that heart that beats as one
It's collectively, unconsciously composed
Doo, doo, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do
Well, I lost my head in San Francisco
Waitin' for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It was smilin' down
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
I've been in love with love
And the idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I've seen some time tell tales about that systematic drug
Yeah, that heart that beats as one
It's collectively, unconsciously composed
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
Doo, doo, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do
