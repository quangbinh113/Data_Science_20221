Song Name: HEAD OVER HEELS
One spray, smell nice
Rolex, fake ice (on the wrist)
New me, in the mirror (he gon' tell the truth, maybe)
Clean shave, clean face (okay)
Expensive, toothpaste
Think about what I do it for
(Well shit, then it's all for you)
Going
Ooh, this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
Ooh this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
Trippin' and stumblin', I'm fallin' down
Mix up my words, while I stare at the ground
Build up the courage to say what I feel
Do I spill alll the beans, or just order the meal
I just ordered the meal (okay)
Still can't say what I feel
All these doubts they just creep in my mind
Meaningless moments I take as a sign
Maybe I'm not your type
Well I'm tired of guessin', all the things you like
(Really, really)
I wanna make plans tonight
(I don't, I don't)
I don't wanna see you out with another guy
Going
Ooh, this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
Ooh this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
You better take off your shoes
(Before you run through my mind)
I've got the good a.m. blues
(Feminine, so divine)
Wish you could read my mind
(Instead of readin' these lines)
Ready, set, go
Going
Ooh, this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
Ooh this is how it feels
Oh you got me, got me, got me
Goin' head over heels
You got me
You got me, you got me
Head over heels
You got me, you got me
You got me head over heels
You got me, you got me
Head over heels
You got me, you got me
You got me head over heels
