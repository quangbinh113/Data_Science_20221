Song Name: 10 Feet Tall
I wanna be ten feet tall
I wanna grow big red horns
Fingers covered in thorns
That pierce everything
I wanna be ten feet tall
I wanna eat fire and snow
I wanna scare everyone
I want to collect swords
Stab my walls when I'm bored
Wear clothes made of old socks
Which are missing their pairs
I wanna be ten feet tall
I wanna eat fire and snow
I wanna scare everyone
Climb over the circus walls
Finally feel at home
Cotton candy floss
Haunted houses ghosts
I wanna feed the ducks
I wanna eat some stones
Sink down to the bed
Finally feel at home
Finally feel at home
Finally feel at home
Finally feel at home
My teeth falling out again
The dentist called my name
I didn't answer him
I feel it in my guts
I'd tear them piece by piece
But I don't care enough
For centre 33
Now I wanna be ten feet tall
With big red horns
Five star banquet
Twenty course
I got no friends
I feel so ill
I'm so dang tall and growing still
I wanna be ten feet tall
I wanna grow big red horns
Fingers covered in thorns
That pierce everything
I wanna be ten feet tall
I wanna eat fire and snow
I wanna scare everyone
