Song Name: Five Hundred Miles
If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Lord, I'm one
Lord, I'm two
Lord, I'm three
Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way
This a-way
This a-way
This a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way
If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
