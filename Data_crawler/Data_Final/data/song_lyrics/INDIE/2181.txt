Song Name: Kate's Not Here - Day Wave & Lawrence Rothman Remix
Tell me, what do you see in the mirror on the wall?
Are you sure that it's me? Is it my turn to fall?
If these walls can talk and read all my thoughts
Am I already lost?
Who's gonna check up on you tonight?
Will you be sleeping with open eyes?
Kate, don't disappear
Kate, don't disappear
A stranger in this home, can't ever be alone
'Cause in the shadows of the sun, there's something going on
To know what's true and false in these worlds that I cross
Am I already lost?
Who's gonna check up on you tonight?
Will you be sleeping with open eyes?
Kate, don't disappear
Kate, don't disappear
Don't disappear
Don't disappear on me
I'm not gonna kill you
I'm not gonna kill you
Who's gonna check up on you tonight?
Will you be sleepin' with open eyes?
Kate, don't disappear
Kate, don't disappear
Don't disappear
