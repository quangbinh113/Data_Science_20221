Song Name: Don't Go Puttin Wishes in My Head
If we're calling off the funeral
Then I'm calling for a hitching
Just when I thought that it was over
It was only just beginning
I know you've been here time and time again
Every man wants his name on a mountain
How many thought they'd be the one to keep your love?
I know promising forever's not your thing
But now, if you don't want me to go dreaming
Don't spend your mornings and your evenings in my bed
If you don't want me believing that you're never gonna leave me, darling
Don't go putting wishes in my head
If we're calling off the funеral
Then I'm calling for a hitching
Your friends warned mе I might lose
What I knew I was winning
If you want, I'll talk myself from the ledge
Lord, girl, you've gone and put me to the test
But I don't want you choosing something you'd regret
I know promising forever's not your thing
But now, if you don't want me to go dreaming
Don't spend your mornings and your evenings in my bed
If you don't want me believing that you're never gonna leave me, darling
Don't go putting wishes in my head
So if we're calling off the funeral
Then I'm calling for a hitching
For a while, I was sinking
But from here on out, I swear I'm swimming
From here on out, I'm swimming
I swear, from here on out, I'm swimming
I know promising forever's not your thing
But now, if you don't want me to go dreaming
Don't spend your mornings and your evenings in my bed
If you don't want me believing that you're never gonna leave me, darling
Don't go putting wishes
If you don't want me believing that you're never gonna leave me, darling
Don't go putting wishes, don't go putting wishes
Don't go putting wishes in my head
