Song Name: The Last Time
One misstep and you're off the handle
Steal my sleep and my peace of mind
Never seen a temper quite so fragile
You'd lashed out, I was kind
This is the last time I let you get to me
You always cut me open to watch me bleed
And then you come back, on your knees
This is the last time, the last time
The last time you get to me
This is the last time, the last time
The last time you get to me
This is the last time, the last time
The last time you get to me
Play my mind like a kite on a string
Flew me high then sent me crashing
Apologies your little white lies
Sweet as poison, at first benign
I get close, you run and hide
Project your mistakes, make them mine
Guilty now for all your crimes
Guilty one last night
This is the last time I let you get to me
You always cut me open to watch me bleed
And then you come back, on your knees
This is the last time, the last time
The last time you get to me
This is the last time, the last time
The last time you get to me
