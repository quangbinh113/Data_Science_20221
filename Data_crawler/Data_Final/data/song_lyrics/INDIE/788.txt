Song Name: creature
Look inside of me and see that I am not afraid
To walk inside the void like a kid inside a cave
Discovering the patterns of my soul and where it's placed
I've been mapping many caverns but it still feels like a maze
I know I'm made of clay that's worn
Blinded by imperfect form
But I will trust the artist moulding me
I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind me
When you guide me
Creature only
Look inside my heart and find a perilous ravine

Carved within the beauty, the darkness in between
Standing in the balance of complete and incomplete
I identify the echo of what is and what will be
I know I'm made of clay that's worn
Lighted by a perfect fire
But I will trust the artist moulding me
In a room that's growing dim
Illuminated from within
The pull of tensions and defeat
I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind me
When you guide me, oh
I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind
'Cause what comes
Creature only
Creature only
(Creature only)
Growing through the creature here
I'm trying to see when it's so clear
Hidden in the space between
Hero and the enemy
Early days and sleepless nights
Death and resurrection, life
My body is a sacred note
Sewn between the flesh and hope
My dirt transformed within a breath
Before I took a single step
I'm looking forward to the day
When life can grow without decay
Humanity is not alone
When Jesus Christ sits on the throne
His hidden years expose the mess
The selfish turns to selflessness
Haunted by a darker side
Transcends to walking in the light
Slowly I'm recovering
The beauty of discovering
