Song Name: BOYFREN
You know I'm grade A
Ya boyfriend wanna B me
You go outta your way
To make sure you don't C me
You should break up with your boyfriend
You should break up with your boyfriend
You should break up with your boyfriend
And get with me
I'm bored and I'm outta my mind
Fingers crossed I hope that I'll be fine
Doing my best to make it rhyme
(Now I'm)
Runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin'
Runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin'
Runnin runnin out of time
Bet you think your boyfriend's cool 'cause he's got nice clothes
Wonder who he saw wearing those (Me!)
I really think that you should break up with him soon
You should break up with your boyfriend
You should break up with your boyfriend

You should break up with your boyfriend

And get with me
I come through (Oh no)
Like a wrecking ball
And break these walls (Oh god)
That you kept him to
And I can't sleep (Oh no)
The night I slept with you
And I can't say (Oh god)
That I'm in love with you
I come through (Oh no)
Like a wrecking ball
And break these walls (Oh god)
That you kept him to
And I can't sleep (Oh no)
The night I slept with you
And I can't say (Oh god)
That I'm in love with you
You should break up with your boyfriend

You should break up with your boyfriend
You should break up with your boyfriend
