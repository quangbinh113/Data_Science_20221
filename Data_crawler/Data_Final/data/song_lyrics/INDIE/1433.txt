Song Name: Funky
Don't wet your eyes, everybody's watching
Don't let this life swallow your whole
Someway, somehow I will find you running
You'll make it out, so take it slow
Lately, I don't know how I feel
Look in the mirror, I see
Somebody else, I guess
I don't know myself, I've been
Stuck riding this rollercoaster
No chipper thrill moments
Passing me by while I'm
Stuck standing still
What if
The sun shines brighter on the other side?
What's paradise when it rains?
Olly olly oxen free uh (olly olly oxen free)
Finding peace when I hear them singing
Don't wet your eyes, everybody's watching
Don't let this life swallow your whole
Someway, somehow I will find you running
You'll make it out, so take it slow
It's been a day or two, I'm in a mood
Changing channels on my pay-per-view and I
Laugh when nothing's funny 'cause I
Dance when I'm feeling funky, but I'm
Lost in a crowded room, I hate the view
Stuck in a groundhog everyday (everyday)
Running into grass where I can lay
Getting faded watching planes
The sun shines brighter on the other side?
What's paradise when it rains?
Olly olly oxen free uh (olly olly oxen free)
Finding peace when I hear them singing
Don't wet your eyes, everybody's watching
Don't let this life swallow your whole
Someway, somehow I will find you running
You'll make it out, so take it slow
If I'm chasing this high (high)
Then how far could I fall? (Ooh)
Am I out of my mind? (Ooh)
Learning to let it go (ooh)
Before I lose control (ooh)
I'ma let this shit ride
Don't wet your eyes, everybody's watching
Don't let this life swallow your whole
Someway, somehow I will find you running
You'll make it out, so take it slow
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take-take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
Finding peace when I hear them singing (take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take it slow)
(Take-take it slow)
Olly olly oxen free (take it slow)
Finding peace when I hear them singing
