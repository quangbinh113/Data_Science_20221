Song Name: Yards / Gardens
I have some trouble keeping track of where I started
Where I started
My friends have occupations now and some have yards
They're tending gardens
Please don't leave me behind
When the world is burning outside
I wanna keep you pinned to my side
I don't know what I'll do otherwise
I lost some of me when I met you
But I would lose even more if I lost you
I'm viewing days like practice rounds
Come next year I'll know what to do
I'm seeing beaches in my mind
I'll get there, it's just a matter of time
I'm finished mourning what I lost in the last year
The past's how I got here
Please don't leave me behind
When the world is burning outside
I wanna keep you pinned to my side
I don't know what I'll do otherwise
Please don't leave me behind
When the world is burning outside
I wanna keep you pinned to my side
I don't know what I'll do otherwise
There you go Jimmy
