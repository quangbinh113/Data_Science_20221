Song Name: Upgrade
Baby, that ain't an upgrade
No way in hell, but you tried, babe
That bitch is crazy
And y'all gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade
You must be out of your mind, babe
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me

Oh my God, I can't believe you fell for a fake
I know that bitch, she's on my dick, been tryna take my place
One step in my stilettos, she gon' fall right on her face
Hope, she like the dirt 'cause she been diggin' her own grave
I never asked who you were callin'
And I gave you trust like it was common
But you had one too many gin and tonics
Hope it got you what the fuck you wanted
Baby, that ain't an upgrade
No way in hell, but you tried, babe
That bitch is crazy
And y'all gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade
You must be out of your mind, babe
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me
So your not fuckin' with this, but you're fuckin' with that
Got your bitch all on my tits 'cause she wants what I have
She can have what I had, she can go through all my trash
'Cause I'm over it
Nah, I don't want you back
Baby, that ain't an upgrade (that ain't an upgrade)
No way in hell, but you tried, babe (I know you tried, babe)
That bitch is crazy
And y'all gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade (if you think that's an upgrade)
You must be out of your mind, babe (out of your mind, babe)
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me (replace me)
Baby, that ain't an upgrade
