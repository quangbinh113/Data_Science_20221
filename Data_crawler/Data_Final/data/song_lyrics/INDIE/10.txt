Song Name: summer depression
De-de-de-depression
Teenage, suicidal
Why, girls?
Emotional
Social denied

Pretty face with pretty bad dreams
No one knows I cry in my sleep
Waking up, feeling like shit
It's a normal thing to feel like this
I don't care, I'm feeling down
I wanna stay home, never go outside
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear
(Depression) Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression
My worst habit
Is my own sadness
So I stay up all night
Wondering why I'm so tired all the time
All my friends are doing things
It's good for them, but I'm nothing
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear
(Depression) Summer depression (why?)
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression
Teenage, suicidal
Why, girls?
Emotional
Social denied
(Depression) Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression

Depression
