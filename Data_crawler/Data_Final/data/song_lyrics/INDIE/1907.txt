Song Name: sugar ray
Dinner date with your high school boyfriend
You can tell by his eyes that he's drank too much
I guess he's looking alright
But he's grabbing on your waist all night and I can't let this fly
I'm in the corner and I'm looking over
And it freaks me out
I see you put your head right on his shoulder
And it freaks me out
'Cause what's a guy like me gotta do?
You grabbed my brain too hard
Now it's black and blue
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
What's a girl like you gotta do?
Your resting face hit hard like I never knew
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
On the radio
Well it's okay, you know
Dead sure you could open up more
'Cause I got my foot crushed hard in the cracked door
Spill food on your last love letter
Told myself probably for the better
And pass the Zoflora
'Cause I just wanna wipe my mind of you tonight
Pass the Zoflora
I don't want any trace of you tonight
'Cause what's a guy like me gotta do?
You grabbed my brain too hard
Now it's black and blue
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
What's a girl like you gotta do?
Your resting face hit hard like I never knew
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
On the radio
Well it's okay you know
If I die before I post
I wanted you to know the most
That I'll sing with you to sugar ray
And If I die before I post
I wanted you to know the most
That I'll sing with you to sugar ray
Well if I die before I post
I wanted you to know the most
That I'll sing with you to sugar ray
Well if I die before I post
I wanted you to know the most
That I'll sing with you to sugar ray
'Cause what's a guy like me gotta do?
You grabbed my brain too hard
Now it's black and blue
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
What's a girl like you gotta do?
Your resting face hit hard like I never knew
I know it's weird but I just want to say
That Kelly told me you still listen to sugar ray
On the radio
Well it's okay you know
