Song Name: Pause
I could never speak in tunes before
But for you I could write a symphony
If only you would sing along
Doesn't even need to be in key
Is what I have enough for you?
Or do you need all the things that I don't.
Separate all the lies from the truths
Picking up the pieces so
Can we hide, I need you close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
Close dance alone
And in time we'll split our
Hearts wide open.
Yes everything it changes
But we still feel the sameness
Slip away, as we fade away
Can you make me feel
That you will never leave
Will it ever be the same again?
We hold each other, just to stay in place
Maybe I'll just be the one to say
Can we hide, I need you close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
Close dance alone
And in time we'll split our
Hearts wide open
Love, hold me close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
No, can we go home?
And this time we'll keep our
Hearts wide open.
