Song Name: Only You... And Everybody Else
Fell in love with a thought
Fell in love with a thought
Fell in love with a thought
But it doesn't wanna fall for me
When i think about it now
I drop to the ground and frown
But at least i'm home so no one can see
Fell in love with a girl
Fell in love with a girl
Fell in love with a girl
But I haven't even met her yet
Do you think she can tell I was thinking of her all the time
Well I don't think she quite knows me yet
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Gonna run with the lights
Gonna run with the lights
Gonna run with the lights
'Til the timer runs out again
Maybe when I get home I won't be alone in my room
Maybe there is a spare hug to lend
Saw a girl on a bike
Saw a girl on a bike
Saw a girl on a bike
I'll never get to see again
She had dyed black hair and metal in her ear
Ripped jeans and a dress
Pretty sure we could be friends
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
