Song Name: Not Alone
Wish that I could see the world
Through her green, empty eyes

She got everything planned out but she knows deep inside
Everything ain't what it seems yeah yeah
She's smiling but it's bitter-sweet yeah yeah
Every time I pass by her place I feel the silence
Won't you tell me why
You are not alone
Promises are for real
Watch you disappear through the darkness
I'll keep your precious secrets in my heart, yes
You are not alone
I just wanted you to know
Watch you disappear through the darkness
Wish I could have asked but it's (far) too late
Wish she could have felt more love 'cause she was such a loner yeah yeah
She always dreamed of Vietnam, bought a map and some posters
Summer dress and light purse yeah yeah
Other girls didn't like her yeah yeah
Every time I walk down this road she's by my side
Won't you stay a while
You are not alone
Promises are for real
Watch you disappear through the darkness
I'll keep your precious secrets in my heart, yes
You are not alone
I just wanted you to know
Watch you disappear through the darkness
Wish I could have asked but it's too late
Late, late, late
Stuck in a maze
My mind turning restless
