Song Name: Holy Forest
When I first saw you you were shy, shy and bright
The summer was boring but I knew we'd be alright
You called in the morning, we met almost at night
Biked through the forest, holy forest full of light
Hiding away now we don't know who we are
Wish we could stay there how come we grew apart
When you first saw me I was shy, shy and quiet
That summer was boring but we knew we'd be alright
