Song Name: Forever & Always
Love songs are fleeting
But the melodies stick with you
I have learned your heart
And memorized the tune
It's my favorite
I'll sing it in any occasion
It'll be my soundtrack
Beyond our youth
Honey now we're older
But we'll never age
I don't think my love will
Ever start to fade
My attachment to you
Isn't subject to change
My heart's yours forever
And always
Every note you hum
Is a classic through and through
I'll add them to a playlist called
All things I look forward to
It's my favorite
Even if no one will play it
I only want a future
Filled with you
Honey now we're older
But we'll never age
I don't think my love will
Ever start to fade
My attachment to you
Isn't subject to change
My heart's yours forever
And always
I'll sing it it still in 10 years time
20, 30, 99
I'll dance as long as I can stand
Partner for life take my hand
We'll set the record for strongest love
Keep the vinyl free of dust
Spin it soft eternally
And my dear you'll sing with me
Honey now we're older
But we'll never age
I don't think my love will
Ever start to fade
My attachment to you
Isn't subject to change
My heart's yours forever
And always
Honey now we're older
But we'll never age
I don't think my love will
Ever start to fade
My attachment to you
Isn't subject to change
My heart's yours forever
And always
