Song Name: Space Between Us
I know my fate, I live for the changes
Too many sins and occasional strangers
Why do I keep things around?
Why hold myself down?
I try to keep my head up
But you're all I can think of right now
I want to feel no space between us
I want to move inside your heart
I've been searching for this place for too long
Too long
I want to feel no space between us
Pull you my way, we run from the danger
Eyes won't betray, release me from anger
Why do I keep things around?
Why hold myself down?
I try to keep my head up
But you're all I can think of right now
I want to feel no space between us
I want to move inside your heart
I've been searching for this place for too long
Too long
I want to feel no space between us
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
I've been searching for this place for too long
Too long
I want to feel no space between us
