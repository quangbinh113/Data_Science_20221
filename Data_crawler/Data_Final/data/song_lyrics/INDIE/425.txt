Song Name: Kids
Oh, I am just a kid
I never use my brain
I only use my heart
And my imagination
Oh, I am just a kid
I always make mistakes
I never say I'm sorry
'Cause they're mistakes that I made
(Get ready)
Oh, I am just a kid
I've never seen the world
And I haven't quite decided
If I'm a boy or a girl
Oh, I am just a kid
I'm afraid of the dark
But I'm obsessed with ideas
One day I'll go far
(Yeah, like this)
Oh, I'm no longer a kid
And everything has changed
There's nothing in my heart
And lightning in my brain
So listen up, you kids
And hear what I say
Don't listen to your brain
And follow your dreams
(What's that?)
