Song Name: Pharmacist
I know you're back
I saw your sister at the pharmacy, picking up
Said you had that new love glow
Now that you're here
I wanna wake up on the right side looking back
Getting out of neutral new track
You know it happens all the time
It's alright (it's alright)
I hear it happens all the time
We volunteered
Local center off the highway, Nicorette
Those paths have grown in now
Velvet fall
An assistant to the way life's shaking out
Those girls are older now
You know it happens all the time
It's alright (it's alright)
I hear it happens all the time
It's alright (it's alright)
I know I never crossed your mind
(I know I never crossed your mind, your mind)
