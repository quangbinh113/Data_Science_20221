Song Name: New Flesh
I listened to The Cure
I listened to The Cure
I listened to The Cure and then I cried
I watched Videodrome
I watched Videodrome
I watched Videodrome and lost my mind
I tried to write a song
I tried to write a song
I tried to write a song I think you'd like
But no one gives a shit
No one gives a shit
No one gives a shit about my life
'Til I die
'Til I die
It's DIY
It's DIY
I have nightmares
I have nightmares
I have nightmares all the time
So I stay awake
So I stay awake
So I stay awake all night
I say I'm gonna leave
I say I'm gonna leave
I say I'm gonna leave but I think you're right
I'm gonna stay right here
I'm gonna stay right here
I'm gonna stay right here until I die
'Til I die
'Til I die
It's DIY
It's DIY
