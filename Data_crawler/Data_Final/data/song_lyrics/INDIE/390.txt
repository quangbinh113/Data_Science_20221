Song Name: Faster
I hate purity
Hate goodness
I don't want virtue to exist anywhere
I want everyone corrupt
I am an architect, they call me a butcher
I am a pioneer, they call me primitive
I am purity, and they call me perverted
Holding you but I only miss these things when they leave
I am idiot drug hive, the virgin, the tattered and the torn
Life is for the cold made warm, and they are just lizards
Self-disgust is self-obsession, honey, and I do as I please
A morality obedient, only to the cleansed repented
I am stronger than Mensa, Miller and Mailer
I spat out plath and pinter
I am all the things that you regret
A truth that washes that learned how to spell
The first time you see yourself naked, you cry
Soft skin now acne, foul breath, so broken
He loves me truly, this mute solitude I'm draining
I know I believe in nothing but it is my nothing
Sleep can't hide the thoughts splitting through my mind
Shadows aren't clean, false mirrors, too many people awake
If you stand up like a nail then you will be knocked down
I've been too honest with myself, I should have lied like everybody else
I am stronger than Mensa, Miller and Mailer
I spat out plath and pinter
I am all the things that you regret
A truth that washes that learned how to spell, learned to spell
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
Hey, hey, hey
