Song Name: at least i look cool
I drive a car that doesn't work
I shop at target for my shirts
And when I pay my rent it hurts
But I got invited to this thing so
I think tonight I'm going out
I'm getting off my shitty couch
Ready to fuck my bank account
And I'm not myself
But at least I look cool
At some house in Malibu
Taking pictures by the pool
Doin' things I'd never do
But at least I look cool
Oh god I think I might throw up
Don't even know what's in my cup
And I'll admit this kinda sucks
But before I leave I know I gotta
Find somewhere dope that I can pose
Adjust my hair adjust my clothes
So I can get that fire post
And it's all for show
But at least I look cool
At some house in Malibu
Taking pictures by the pool
Doin' things I'd never do
But at least I look cool
At some house I can't afford
Blacked out on the tennis court
Honestly I'm kinda bored
But at least I look cool
I just lied about my age
Nobody even knows my name
Got an Uber Pool on the way (Shh)
But at least I look cool
At some house in Malibu
Taking pictures by the pool
Doin' things I'd never do
But at least I look cool
At some house I can't afford
Blacked out on the tennis court
Honestly I'm kinda bored
But at least I look cool
