Song Name: Let It All Hang Out (feat. PlayThatBoiZay)
Oh-oh-oh
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out, ow, ow, ow
Let it all hang out (yeah, ha, yeah)
Let it all hang out, ow, ow, ow (yeah, du-du-du, du-du-du)
She say I'm actin' up, I'm a movie
Hot, see me bubblin', a jacuzzi (ayy)
Stay with a stick like they 'bout to recruit me
Turnin' out girls, it's so ghetto and bougie (ayy)
She like how I run it up, so she choose me (yeah)
Stackin' my money up, I feel like Boosie
Rockstar jit, shave my width (yeah)
Flex up on 'em, make 'em sick
I've been through hell and back, many obstacles
They said I couldn't do the impossible
My life's a open book, it's a Audible
Been in the public eye like a monocle
Call me a shootin' star, astronomical
I got the vibe from the side and it's colorful
You call it ghetto, but I call it wonderful
Do what they say, but I do what I wanna do (yeah)
(Yeah) I got the feelin' I'm givin' so much
To the people that don't even love me enough
So I hopped in my whip, left my fans in the dust
On the new side of town where they tearin' it up, like
She say I'm actin' up, I'm a movie
Hot, see me bubblin', a jacuzzi (ayy)
Stay with a stick like they 'bout to recruit me
Turnin' out girls, it's so ghetto and bougie (ayy)
She like how I run it up, so she choose me (yeah)
Stackin' my money up, I feel like Boosie
Rockstar jit, shave my width (yeah)
Flex up on 'em, make 'em sick (ayy)
I've been through hell and back, many obstacles
They said I couldn't do the impossible
Safe to say I'm a king, very possible
Baby, it's in my genes, biological
King like Louis and I'm wearin' pink
King like Louis, I'ma need a drink
Louis the Thirteenth
When I walk around, everyone thirsty
Later on, it's gon' bring out the worst me
With my problems, a hand is gon' nurse me
So you better just give me your medic or give me a second
I'm back in this thing and I'm ready to set it all off
She say I'm addin' up, I'm a movie
Hot, see me bubblin', a jacuzzi (ayy)
Stay with a stick like they 'bout to recruit me
Turnin' out girls, it's so ghetto and bougie (ayy)
She like how I run it up, so she choose me (yeah)
Stackin' my money up, I feel like Boosie
Rockstar jit, shave my width (yeah)
Flex up on 'em, make 'em sick (ayy)
She say I'm addin' up, I'm a movie
Hot, see me bubblin', a jacuzzi (ayy)
Stay with a stick like they 'bout to recruit me
Turnin' out girls, it's so ghetto and bougie (ayy)
She like how I run it up, so she choose me (yeah)
Stackin' my money up, I feel like Boosie
Rockstar jit, shave my width (yeah, yeah)
Flex up on 'em, make 'em sick (ayy)
