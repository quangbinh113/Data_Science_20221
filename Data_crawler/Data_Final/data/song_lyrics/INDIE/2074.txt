Song Name: In Your Room
I always try
To keep my eyes from closing
Besides, I still see you
It seems so right
To think of the time we could have tonight
And it's so cold
It seems my hands
Are colder than yours, warm me up inside
Your face turns red and so does mine
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie
You shine so bright
A light inside my head
I love the thought of staring at you
Asleep at night
Kaleidoscopic thoughts of me and you
And you're just so cool
For me to see
The life we'd have and we'd tell everyone
Your face turns red and so does mine
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie
I always try
To keep my eyes from closing
Besides, I still see you
Asleep at night
Kaleidoscopic thoughs of me and you
Are so above my way of life
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie
