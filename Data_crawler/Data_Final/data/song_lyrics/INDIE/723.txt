Song Name: Loner
They say avoidance never heals, but this sure feels good
Gonna stay here a couple more minutes than I should
Gonna take a couple shots to numb my feelings
Instead of dealing with my problems, I'll just stare at the ceiling
Avoidance never heals, but this sure feels good
I know I said I'd stop before I drown
But I don't like the thought of coming down
Yeah, I'm a loner and I like it that way
I like a dark room with nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner and I like it that way
And I like it that way
I'm always by myself 'cause that's what feels right
And when I'm in a crowded room, I try to stay out of sight
Always show up to the party hours early
'Cause I'm bored of everything by 7:30
I'm always by myself 'cause that's what feels right
I know I said I'd stop before I drown
Just took a couple pills, now I'm on the ground
Yeah, I'm a loner and I like it that way
I like a dark room with nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner and I like it that way
I like it that way
Yeah, I'm a loner, ayy-ayy
Yeah, I'm a loner and I like it that way (that way)
I like a dark room with nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner and I like it that way
I like it that way
