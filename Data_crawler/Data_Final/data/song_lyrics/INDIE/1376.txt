Song Name: Alphamale
Called you up this evening
Wanna go outside
Where we go doesn't matter
We're going for a ride
(For a ride)
I'm tired of being lonely
I never leave my bed
If anyone is asking
Don't listen to your head
(To your head)
Just feel the music moving
Let go of all your pride
You're good at being good and all
But lets go for a ride
(For a ride)
