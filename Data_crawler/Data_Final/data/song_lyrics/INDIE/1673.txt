Song Name: Cherry Wine
Why you standing all by yourself?
Those shoes were made for dancing with someone else
Why don't we move over to that empty space?
I bet you 20 bucks I'll put a smile on your face
I know a place where we can
Dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine, huh
Well, it's so soon to give up on tonight, uh
I haven't had the chance to show you my moves and I
I think you'd like to see why they would call me Mr. Dynamite
I can show while we dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine
I've been waiting on this dance
Floor made for two babe
Won't you show me just what you can do?
I don't wanna waste your time
So please just have me for tonight? Huh
Dance
Yeah, I said let's dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine
Oh, I, dance the night away
Baby we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time, uh
Know it's too soon to say you're mine
Let's have a little drink tonight
And get to know each other over cherry wine
