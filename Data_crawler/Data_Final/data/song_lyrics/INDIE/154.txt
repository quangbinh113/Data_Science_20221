Song Name: pajamas
Let's watch TV with the sound off
'Cause the news is always bad
Let's be immature and ignorant
'Cause I don't feel like being sad
I wonder if the last generation was better
I wonder if the next one's going to hell
Am I the solution, am I the problem?
'Cause sometimes I can't tell
I don't know what the point is
Just know I've been disappointed
Each night and every mornin'
And I don't wanna play no more
Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
And I don't understand it
But stay in our pajamas
It's a little overwhelming
When you put it in perspective
That life is just a bunch of memories
That we've tattered and collected
I wonder if the trees think we're all greedy
If the air thinks we're all crooks
If the water thinks we're too needy
If the sun gives us dirty looks
I don't know what the point is
Just know I've been disappointed
Each night and every mornin'
And I don't wanna play no more
Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
I don't understand it
Lets stay in our pajamas
Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas
Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas
No worries, no cares, don't go down the stairs
I'm here and I'll hold ya
Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
And I don't understand it
But stay in our pajamas
