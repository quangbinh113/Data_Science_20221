Song Name: Not How It's Supposed To Go
Be a good girl, pretty house wife
Need to have sex every night
Remove all hair from your body
But don't you dare cut yourself 'cause
He might see you bleed
All these expectations, please
Hold yourself up to a standard
For somebody else's needs
Wipe the tears off of your cheeks
Yeah, this man should set you free
But it didn't work for me
I was filling up my head with those lies
Tryna tell me everything's fucking fine
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so right
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
I made a wish into a fallen eyelash
It flew away, and so I took my life back
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so bad
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
Setting small fires, little tantrums
Break the dry wall with your fist
I'll tell myself that this is normal
Just a bandage on my hand 'cause
He might see you bleed
All these expectations please
Hold yourself up to a standard
For somebody else's needs
Wipe the tears off of your cheeks
Yeah, this man should set you free
But it didn't work for me
I was filling up my head with those lies
Tryna tell me everything's fucking fine
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so right
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
I made a wish into a fallen eyelash
It flew away, and so I took my life back
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so bad
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
Oh no, oh no
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so bad
Oh, I was filling up my head with those lies
Tryna tell me everything's fucking fine
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so right
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
I made a wish into a fallen eyelash
It flew away, and so I took my life back
I wanted love, you know I wanted it so bad
Oh, now I know that's not how it's supposed to go
