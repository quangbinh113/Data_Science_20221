Song Name: Youngblood
Remember the words you told me, "Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby, now, you're calling me by name (mmm)
Takes one to know one, yeah, you beat me at my own damn game
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Lately, our conversations end like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby? Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers, hope to God you see my face (ooh, ooh)
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you
Mmm, from you
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
