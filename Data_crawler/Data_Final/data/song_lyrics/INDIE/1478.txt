Song Name: Crutch
Not, not a long time ago when I knew all the answers
I couldn't pace myself or raise my standards
But one can hope, you need to know
And then one stayed one, one stayed one
Forgotten where I was confusing it with another that I saw
You wouldn't like nothing tonight
Beginning was quite disturbing
I got a crutch on you
Just sick of needing something to do, to do
Tablets in my pocket at the Easter soiree
Bouncing off the carpet in line for TSA
A lot of wasps on the walls, wasps on the walls
Bailing toilet water in Lake Full of Moccasin
I'm wrong, you're right, no need to fight
The middle was dark and storming
You're on your own, I need to go
I got a crutch on you
Guess I got nothing to lose
Inebriated late afternoon, you were fading now I'm holding on too
I got a crutch on you
Finally nothing left to prove
I sit around too long, way too long
Thinking I should go, thinking I should go
I'm going too
Too
I've got a crutch on you
Wishing there was something that I could do
I've got a crutch on you
I've got a crutch on you, got a crutch on you
Wishing there was something that I could do
Got a crutch on you
