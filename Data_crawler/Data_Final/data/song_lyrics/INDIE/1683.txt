Song Name: Dial Two Seven
Step off the plane, red dust on white Nike
I don't take calls from ex anymore
I don't write scripts, Spike Lee, no film roll
Come from the left, move right, change ID
See, I can be the girl you need on the low
Let your friends know, let your breathe slow
Chase light
Summer, summer migrate like
Soul tied
I want a love so tight
Step off the plane, red dust on white Nike
I got nothing to lose, you can count on me
All new shoes, you can count on me
Dial two sеven in the a.m
It's north to the Capе by the p.m
Ride Uber to see him in the East End
It's sex in the city for the weekend
Swept off the ground, I'm feeling high like he
Knows how to tick my boxes
Border cross this, open up to me
Come from the small town, watch the sun go down
Nothing like gold over Hillbrow
Nothing like me and you right now, ego stand down
Chase light
Summer, summer migrate like
Soul tied
I want a love so tight
Step off the plane, red dust on white Nike
I got nothing to lose, you can count on me
All new shoes, you can count on me
Dial two seven in the a.m
It's north to the Cape by the p.m
Ride Uber to see him in the East End
It's sex in the city for the weekend
Chase light
Summer, summer migrate like
Soul tied
I want a love so tight
Chase light
Summer, summer migrate like
Soul tied (chase light)
I want a love so tight
Step off the plane, red dust on white Nike
I got nothing to lose, you can count on me
All new shoes, you can count on me
Dial two seven in the a.m
It's north to the Cape by the p.m
Ride Uber to see him in the East End
It's sex in the city for the weekend
Chase light
Summer, summer migrate like
Soul tied
I want a love so tight
