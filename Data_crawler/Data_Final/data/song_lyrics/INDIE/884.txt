Song Name: 2014 - Acoustic
Packing up out the driveway
Memorized every line to the highway
Mattress on the floor in a new place
Ex-girl's older sister found my roommate
And I didn't have the money, but went out with everybody
And I don't remember their names
Got a few numbers on some napkins, and nothing really happened
But knew I was never leaving this place
It was 4 a.m. with friends I just met
Singing every single word to the new Taylor Swift
We had so far to go but nowhere to be
It was all we could see in 2014
Cheers to nothing, getting tattoos
Five days, saw your face, had to have you
If you told me you were going
Suddenly all my plans would be open
And I only came to see you, but I'll talk to other people
So it looks like I'm still playing it cool
Said something stupid, saw you laughing
The whole room saw it happen the way I was only looking at you
It was 4 a.m., we were sippin' outside
All our friends in the kitchen, almost every single night
We had so far to go but nowhere to be
It was all we could see in 2014
In 2014
I could feel it finally starting
I could change, make mistakes, be who I wanted
It was first time, it was freedom
Threw out the boxes, I didn't need 'em
It was 4 a.m., still drinkin' outside
We were all gonna make it, we had stars in our eyes
We had so far to go but nowhere to be
It was all we could see in 2014
In 2014
We had so far to go but nowhere to be
It was all we could see in 2014
