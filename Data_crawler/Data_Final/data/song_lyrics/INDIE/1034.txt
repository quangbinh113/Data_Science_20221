Song Name: motive (with Doja Cat)
Mu-mu-mu-murda
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna turn me on
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna make me yours, ah
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one to sing along
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Baby, tell me, what's your motive? (Motive)
What's your motive?
What's your motive? (Ah)
So tell me, what's your motive? (What's your motive?)
What's your motive?
What's your motive? (Ah)
I could call bullshit all from a mile away (don't say)
You want me if you can't keep comin' back for me
Might have to curve you if you just can't talk straight (just say)
Say what you mean 'cause you might get it
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one to sing along
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? (Ah)
So tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? (Ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, ah)
You treat me like gold, baby
Now you wanna spoil me
Did you want a trophy or you wanna sport me, baby?
Want me on your neck 'cause you wanted respect
'Cause you fightin' some war, baby
Well, I had to bring the fists out, had to put a wall up
I don't trust phonies, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You gotta tell me, what's your motive, baby?
'Cause you got your candy (yeah) on your arm (yeah)
No need to sugarcoat a lie (yeah)
Say what you want, I needed a real bona fide G (come on)
Can you promise me you'll bring it all tonight? (Give it to me)
'Cause I need you to be wise
Tell me everything that's on your mind, come on
Baby, tell me what's your motive? (Tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (What's your motive?)
What's your motive? (What's your motive? Ah)
So tell me, what's your motive? (Better tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (What's your motive? Better tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (Yeah, ayy, ah)
