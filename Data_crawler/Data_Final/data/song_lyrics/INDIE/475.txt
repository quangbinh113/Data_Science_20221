Song Name: I Think We Should Stay in Love
The hardest part of making love
Is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love
All right
The hardest part of making love
Baby, is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love
(Turn me up a little bit)
You don't gotta worry about me
You should be relieved
That you ever found me
You know you can say what you need
And I'll get it real fast
I'm just tryna save what we have
I get along with your momma
I can hang with your dad
I'm focused on the good
Staying away from the bad
I'll tell you anything if you ever want to ask
At the end of the day I just pray
You don't do this for your advantage
And I don't take what we have for granted
The hardest part of making love
Is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love, alright
The hardest part of making love
Baby, is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love
If we stay then we'll be alright
Baby everyday is okay if you're in my life
You got some jesters waiting outside
But they might have to wait until the day I die
The hardest part of making love
Is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love, alright
The hardest part of making love
Baby, is breaking up
So if you don't mind
I think we should stay in love
Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, Fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, Love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Don't leave me
