Song Name: Trigger Of Love
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
BMX girl bunny hop on it, playlists to monopoly
Playboy in a mansion like I'm Hefner and she toppin' me
Landing strip on it big enough to fly cock pit
She woke me up to kisses, I'm distant and told her to stop it
Wake up, make love
I'm breaking a sweat, I think I need some ventilation
Laid up, stayed stuck
I'm taking the check, I work the week like it's a day shift
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
Meet my next girl, she on top of shit
I stay out the gossiping
Playboy and she dance around me naked, Janis Joplin
Anything is possible, girl
Politicking with you not a problem, girl
Wake up, make love
I'm breaking a sweat, I think I need some ventilation
Laid up, stayed stuck
I'm taking the check, I work the week like it's a day shift
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
Run, she got the gun
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is of love
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom
Run, she got the gun (anything is possible, girl)
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is
Of love (politicking with you not a problem, girl)
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom (anything is possible, girl)
(Politicking with you not a problem, girl)
Run, she got the gun (anything is possible, girl)
She will pull the trigger on you and the trigger is
Of love (politicking with you not a problem, girl)
She got the run, the gun
And the boom-boom, boom-boom (anything is possible, girl)
(Politicking with you not a problem, girl)
She got me, she got me, she got me wanting something
She got me, she got me, she got me down on one knee
