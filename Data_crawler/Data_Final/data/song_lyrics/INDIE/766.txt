Song Name: Siren
You'll be seein' me in your dreams and
I'll be there when your reality drowns
There's a bright side
To every wrong thing
If you're looking at me through the right eyes
Darkness in my name
Don't you wanna come and play on the cool side
Don't be so shy
There's a pleasure in hidin' from the sun
No, I was never one for pretty weather
I'd rather be a creep, baby, follow me into the water
I'll take you to the darker
This could be perfection
A venom drippin' in your mouth
Singin' like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seeing me in your dreams but
I'll be there when your reality drowns
You can pretend
That when you hear my voice
Darlin' it's a choice not to fall in
But it's all an act, 'cause I know exactly what you're wantin'
You know it's what I'm wantin'
Boy, I know what you desire
Oh, you're such a bad, bad liar
This could be perfection
A venom drippin' in your mouth
Singin' like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seein' me in your dreams but
I'll be there when your reality drowns
I'll be there when your reality drowns
Boy, I know what you desire
Oh, you're such a bad, bad liar
I want you and I just can't take it
So, listen to me when I say it
This could be perfection
A venom drippin' in your mouth
Singin' like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seein' me in your dreams but
I'll be there when your reality drowns
I'll be there when your reality drowns
