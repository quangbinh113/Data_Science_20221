Song Name: Super Freak
Face off in the strobe lights
Whatcha popping is it red or blue
Dressed up LA limo nights
Now I'm sitting in a neon room
She walked into my life
Put a gun to my head
And there's nothing really I can't do
She's a bad ass bitch
And she wants me dead
You ain't ready for this
You ain't ready for this
So come on
We don't know nothing about it
We don't know nothing about it
We don't know nothing about it
We don't know nothing about it
Times ticking out
And I can't help myself
Cos there's no way back
And I'm in too deep
I think I need some help
看我就好
無可救藥
I ain't ready for this
You ain't ready for this
So let me figure you out
Your body's a temple
Your skin's so fine
Your tear are like pearls
Baby you make me cry
I need somebody give me anatomic loving
Baby no one can stop me now
She's a super freak
And she walk like this
She's a super freak
And she walk like this
I know
You know
We know
Baby no one's safe
She's a Super Freak
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Get lost in the club tonight
You let me go and now you want me back
Punk kids in the city fight
Like a killer queen maniac
If you wanted my love
I could give it to you
Future victim of a heart attack
She's a bad ass bitch
And she wants me back
I ain't ready for this
You ain't ready for this
So come on
Your body's a temple
Your skin's so fine
Your tear are like pearls
Baby you make me cry
I need somebody give me anatomic loving
Baby no one can stop me now
She's a super freak
And she walk like this
She's a super freak
And she walk like this
I know
You know
We know
Baby no one's safe
She's a Super Freak
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Don't like your attitude
I like the way you move
Like the way you move
But I like the way you move
But I like the way you move
Like the way you move
Get freaky
Get freaky
Get freaky
Oooh
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
We got you moving
Got you moving all night
