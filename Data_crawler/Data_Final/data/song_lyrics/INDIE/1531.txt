Song Name: You Broke My Heart
Don't
Don't give up
'Cause your crying
It isn't enough
Love
No I'm not in love
'Cause you're not worth it
You're not worth thinking of

You're not worth thinking of
Oh run

Yeah I saw you run
From the televisions
From the televisions
Oh Run
God I saw you run
Now I'll never never never never
See you again

I'll never see you again
And cry
Oh I want you to cry

For what you did to me
On that night
'Cause I'm scared
God I'm terrified
What will happen to my life
To my life
So don't
Give up

'Cause you tried
'Cause you tried
'Cause you tried

But it wasn't good enough
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart

'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart

'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart

'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart

'Cause you broke my heart
'Cause you broke my heart
