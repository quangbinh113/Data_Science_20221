Song Name: Aphelios, the Weapon of the Faithful
Awake to my voice
And hear her call within
Embrace the fear inside
Surrender your mind to night again
Close your eyes
Have faith in me
And leave the light behind
You're never alone
Whenever it's cold, let the shadows take hold
You're never alone
Let the poison in
Feel the warmth arise
Close your eyes
Have faith in me
And leave the light behind
You're never alone
Whenever it's cold, let the shadows take hold
You're never alone
And live within, dreams revealed
I'm with you, never alone
Soon you'll be
Set truly free
From all those chains you bear
You're never alone
And live within, dreams revealed
I'm with you, never alone
