Song Name: I'm in Love Without You
I'm in love without you
Please don't still love me
I'm in love without you
But you still find a way inside my dreams
How can you say there was nothing wrong with us?
When everyday you called, you yelled, you had enough
I loved you more and more each time you slammed the door
My bloody knuckles knocking on and end up bruised
But I loved you less and less as my love turned to loneliness
And I'd already lost what I was afraid to lose
Now I'm in love without you
Please don't still love me
I'm in love without you
But you still find a way inside my dreams
Now, can you see, why you should get over me?
Soon there will be someone else for you to learn to need
You loved him more and more as you stopped keeping score
Of who I was and what we were and when we knew
You loved me less and less as you lean in against his chest
And hear the heartbeat that only beats for you
Now I'm in love without you
So please don't still love me
I'm in love without you
But you still find a way inside my dreams
Inside my dreams
Inside my dreams
Inside my dreams
Inside my dreams
I'm in love without you
