Song Name: God in Jeans
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favourite song
My love, he caught me crying
Freedom can die so hard
When you have a broken heart
Tears of joy
I pray to the open sky
This is the one I wanted
This is everything
Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favourite song
My love is my religion
Preaching the choir
Fuelling the fire
Oh my God, you know I need ya
If I'm going to hell, I'm taking you with me
I'm taking you with me
Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song
So what do you think it is?
I don't know, I'm totally freaked out
It's probably aliens
No it's probably the government
Totally aliens, completely coming in to invade the,
The you know the world right now with everything that's going on
I would be okay with that
