Song Name: Pump It Up - 2021 Remaster
I've been on tenterhooks
Ending in dirty looks
Listening to the music
Thinking 'bout this and that
She said that's that
I don't wanna chitter-chat
Turn it down a little bit
Or turn it down flat
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Down in the pleasure center
Hell bent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda
Listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand
That she wouldn't understand
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Hey
She's been a bad girl
She's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it
She's like a narcotic
You wanna torture her
You wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her
Putting up your temperature
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Out in the fashion show
Down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out
Under the pressure pin
Fall into submission
Hit-and-run transmission
No use wishing now
For any other sin
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Pump it up
Until you can feel it
Pump it up
When you don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
