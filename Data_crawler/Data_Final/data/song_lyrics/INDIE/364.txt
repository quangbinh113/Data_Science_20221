Song Name: Burned Out
He was certain
So was I
There was comfort in her sighs
Dreams and ideas should not be the same thing
You waited smiling for this
Oh, she'd wanted if she knew
She could take it
I thought too
Be careful, be cautious but you just wished harder
You waited smiling for this
But they love you
Over and over
They love you
Thousands and thousands of eyes
Just like mine
Aching to find who they are
Oh, they love you
Oh, You can feel how they love you
Coated and warm
But that's all they can do
Words only get through if they're sharp
Oh, how fitting for one so fake
Make me a fairy
Whatever it takes
And just like a tale my dream was a scam
You waited smiling for this
I am burnt out
I smell of smoke
It sips through her cracks and so I start to choke
Sentences sit in her mouth that are templated
You waited smiling for this
But they love you
Over and over
They love you
Thousands and thousands of eyes
Just like mine
Aching to find who they are
Oh, they love you
Oh, You can feel how they love you
Coated and warm
But that's all they can do
Words only get through if they're sharp
Oh maybe I'll talk about it
Maybe I'll talk about it
I can just talk about it
(I can just talk about it)
I'll never talk about it
(I'll never talk about it)
No, I can not talk about it
Don't build hope on something broken
I am not cartoon
Cry for help
I am not joking
I might just leave soon
Don't build hope on something broken
I am not cartoon
Cry for help
I am not joking
I might just leave soon
