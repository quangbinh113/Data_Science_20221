Song Name: California Screaming
Left my body landing
Rationale abandoned
Racing to the bottom
Catastrophic feeling
Having trouble breathing
California Screaming
It gets so hot in the heat of it all
Shine a light, make it shine on
Am I here at all?
Am I here at all?
Constantly I'm thinking
An alarm is ringing
But nobody's moving
I shut my eyes and listen
Assume the brace position
California screaming
It gets so hot in the heat of it all
Shine a light, make it shine on
Am I here at all?
Am I here at all?
It gets so hot in the heat of it all
Shine a light, make it shine on
Am I here at all?
Am I here at all?
It gets so hot in the heat of it all
Shine a light, make it shine on
Am I here at all?
Am I here at all?
