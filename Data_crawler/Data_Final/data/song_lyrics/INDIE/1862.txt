Song Name: Elliot's Song - From "Euphoria" An HBO Original Series
I've got no place
Building you a rocket up to outer space
I watch you fade
Keeping the lights on in this forsaken place
Little star
Feels like you fell right on my head
Gave you away to the wind
I hope it was worth it in the end
Us against the world
Just a couple sinners making fun of hell
Mmh, if I keep you here
I'll only be doing it for myself
Little star
Feels like you fell right on my head
Gave you away to the wind
I hope it was worth it in the end
I know this thing is broken
So I'll leave my door wide open
Been some time sincе we've spoken
Onе day, we'll meet again
Little star
Feels like you fell right on my head
Gave you away to the wind
I hope it was worth it in the end
You and my guitar
I think you may be my only friend
I gave it all to see you shine again
I hope it was worth it in the end
I hope it was worth it in the end
