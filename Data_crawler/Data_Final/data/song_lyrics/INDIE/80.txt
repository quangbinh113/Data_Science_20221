Song Name: Introducing Me - From "Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam"
I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm tryna grow a mustache
I eat cheese
But only on pizza, please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I, I really like it
When the moon looks like a toenail
And I love it when you say my name
If you wanna know, here it goes, gonna tell you this
A part of me that shows
If we're close gonna let you see
Everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm tryna do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear the things in my brain
My heart
Well you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
Slightly amusing
Introducing me
Do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do do-do-do-do-do
La-da-da-da la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I never trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word "dude"
As a noun or an adverb or an adjective
And I, I've never been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheros
And checks with lots of zeros on them
I love the sound of violins and making someone
Smi-i-i-ile
If you wanna know, here it goes, gonna tell you this
A part of me that shows
If we're close gonna let you see
Everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm tryin' to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear the things in my brain
My heart
Well you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
Possibly amusing
Introducing me
Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next ti-i-i-ime
So, if you wanna know, here it goes, gonna tell you this
A part of me that shows
If we're close gonna let you see
Everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm tryna do my best to impress
But its easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear the things in my brain
My heart
Well you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
Hopefully amusing
Introducing me
Do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do do-do-do-do-do
Introducing me
