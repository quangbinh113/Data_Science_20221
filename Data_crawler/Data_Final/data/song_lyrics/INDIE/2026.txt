Song Name: The Bottom of It
Now that you've gotten to the autumn of
Your years and you feel your best yet
And you found a turkey feather and you hung it like an amulet
So happy that you got to the bottom of
The fears that were fettering you
And you found a round stone and you're wearing it around like a jewel
Doors creaking loud, swinging wide open
And you found yourself, man, and that's something
Now that you've wandered to the clearing in
The woods where the wheats sway in the wind
And you found a dead deer and you made it into moccasins
Overjoyed that you've gotten to the flat spot
In the field and you're starting to feel
That it's hearkening to something heartening
Doors creaking loud, swinging wide open
And you found yourself, man, and that's something
And the doors creaking loud, swinging wide open
You found yourself, man, and that's something
So happy that you got to the bottom of
The fears that were fettering you
And you found a round stone and you're wearing it around like a jewel
