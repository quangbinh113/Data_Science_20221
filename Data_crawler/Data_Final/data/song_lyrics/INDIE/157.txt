Song Name: feel better
If emotion's a wave, then sad is a tidal
It's a hell of a ride, but feeling is vital
'Cause if we don't then we won't
Know it won't last forever
If we feel together, then we'll feel better
I don't really understand this life
And why we're all here
All I know is, when your hand's in mine
The questions disappear
And I'm less obsessed with the reasons and guessin'
What life had in mind for me all this time
All the ups and the downs seem worth it
Feels like maybe we made it on purpose
You make me feel better
That's all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don't know what that means
But it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it and
Shake off the nervous
And wake up with purpose, it's true
You make me feel better
So, I hope, I make you feel better too
I suppose I could propose
But this is how it comes and goes
And what we know ain't all we know
And all my noes and all my yeses taught me lessons
Overthinkin' second guesses
I don't usually do this, you know I been through it
Love hasn't been good for my health
But you ain't no plan B and you understand me
And I can't keep my hands to myself
You make me feel better
That's all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don't know what that means
But it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it and
Shake off the nervous
And wake up with purpose, it's true
You make me feel better
So I hope, I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
I hope I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
'Cause I definitely feel better with you
I'm not good at much
Just singin' songs and lovin' you, but
Every time we touch
I know I'm doin' what I'm s'posed to do
I'm not good at much
Just singin' songs and lovin' you, but
Every time we touch
All I wanna be is closer to you
You make me feel better
That's all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don't know what that means
But it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it
And shake off the nervous
And wake up, you're perfect, it's true
You make me feel better
So, I hope, I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
I hope I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
I hope I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
I hope I make you feel better too
Ooh-oh, ohh-oh
'Cause I definitely feel better with you
