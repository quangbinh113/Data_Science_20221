Song Name: In My Room
They say counting stars
You play the part of a soul missin' home
Were you counting stars?
'Cause you packed your bags, had your heart set to roam
When you left for Georgia
Said your friends didn't want ya
But I swear I do, say, "What we are?"
Time's not a problem
Do you think we were moving too fast?
Guess we weren't meant to last
I can't move on from that and I don't have the words
So I'll keep counting stars inside of my room
Inside my room
(In my room)
