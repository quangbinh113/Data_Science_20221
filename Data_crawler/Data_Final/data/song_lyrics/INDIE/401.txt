Song Name: Wish You Were Sober
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were sober, sober, sober...)
This party's sh-, wish we could dip
Go anywhere but here
Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips
And please don't drink more beer
I'ma crawl through the window now
'Cause I don't like anyone around
Kinda hope you're following me out
But this is definitely not my crowd
19 but you act 25 now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
Trip down the road, walking you home
You kissed me at your door
Pulling me close, begging me to stay over
But I'm over this rollercoaster
I'ma crawl outta the window now
Getting good at saying, "Gotta bounce"
Honestly you always let me down
And I know we're not just hanging out
19 but you act 25 now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were so-)
(Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish you were sober
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish (oh)
I wish you were sober
19 but you act 25 now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober
