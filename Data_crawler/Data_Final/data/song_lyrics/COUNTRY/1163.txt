Song Name: My Church
I've cursed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace a few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost runnin' through ya
When I play the Highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that's my church
When Hank reads the sermon
And cash leads the choir
It gets my cold-cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rollin', radio scrollin'
'Til my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost runnin' through ya
When I play the Highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that's my church
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost runnin' through ya
When I play the Highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that's my church
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost runnin' through ya
When I play the Highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that's my church
Yeah, I guess that's my church
Yeah, I guess that's my church
