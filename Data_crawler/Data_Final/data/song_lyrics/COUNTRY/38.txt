Song Name: Don't It Sound Alright
Take me down where the boat miss the water
Where the sun sinks the down on a light and above it
Sittin' in a truck, been sippin' red wine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Rage ain't a house on a hill
And free is more than just a good deal
Yeah, life ain't supposed to feel like a hamster wheel
But it does sometimes
So let's get the hell outta here
Roll the windows down, drive 'til we're near
That little spot that no one else can find
Except you and I, and I, alright
Take me down where the boat miss the water
Where the sun sinks the down on a light and above it
Sittin' in a truck, been sippin' red wine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Take me down where the phones ain't working
And the world slows down to the speed of the current
Where I'm all yours and you're all mine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Time, we only get so much of it
Love, we can't make enough of it
Slow dance and holding my hand
Let the grass be the floor and the crickets be the band
Take me down where the boat miss the water
Where the sun sinks the down on a light and above it
Sittin' in a truck, been sippin' red wine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Take me down where the phones ain't working
And the world slows down to the speed of the current
Where I'm all yours and you're all mine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright? (Yeah, yeah)
Take me down where the boat miss the water
Where the sun sinks the down on a light and above it
Sittin' in a truck, been sippin' red wine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Take me down where the phones ain't working
And the world slows down to the speed of the current
Where I'm all yours and you're all mine
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright, yeah
Well, don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Don't it sound, don't it sound alright?
Yeah, baby
