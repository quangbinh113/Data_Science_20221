Song Name: Never Til Now (feat. Brett Young)
I'm a picture-perfect painting of imperfection
I'm a walking definition of unsettled and restless
The needle in my compass points anywhere but home
I thought I'd always be alone, 'cause
I never wanted to tap my brakes
I never wanted to settle down
I was always one foot out the door
I never thought about turning 'round
Never saw myself with a white picket fence dug into the ground
Never 'til now
Out of all the prayеrs I've prayed
You're Hеaven's answer
Out of all the hell I've been through
I never thought you'd be out there
But thank God you were right there, 'cause
I never wanted to tap my brakes
I never wanted to settle down
I was always one foot out the door
I never thought about turning 'round
Never saw myself with a white picket fence dug into the ground
Never 'til now
Never 'til you walked into that bar
Never 'til we talked over that song
Never 'til we danced 'til closin' time
Never 'til you proved me wrong
'Bout the kind of love you fall so hard
You never hit the ground
Never 'til now
Oh, never 'til now
Yeah, the kind of love you fall so hard
You never hit the ground
Never 'til now
Never 'til you walked into that bar
Never 'til we talked over that song
Never 'til we danced 'til closing time
Never 'til you proved me wrong
'Bout the kind of love you fall so hard
You never hit the ground
Never 'til now
Yeah, the kind of love you fall so hard
You never hit the ground
Never 'til now
