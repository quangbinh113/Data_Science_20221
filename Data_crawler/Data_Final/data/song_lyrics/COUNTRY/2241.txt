Song Name: I Never Once Stopped Loving You
The nights were dark and long, I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still, my dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing
We'd love again, the way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another but I chose to wait and suffer
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
Oh I never once stopped believing
We'd love again, the way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
