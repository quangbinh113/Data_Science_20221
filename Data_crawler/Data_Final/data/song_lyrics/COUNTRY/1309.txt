Song Name: At the End of a Bar - Acoustic
You can find your future
Or run into your past
You can look for answers
At the bottom of a glass
You can make a best friend
And never know their name
And buy 'em shots of tequila then forget why you came
There's a million things that you can find
Bartender conversation or a pair of blue eyes, yeah
Your true love or next broken heart
Maybe a party crowd on a Friday night
Long necks, long lines and neon signs, hell
Sometimes that's where it all starts
At the end of a bar
You can hear a cover band
Playin' 90s songs
Become a brand new man
To time marches on
Time marches on
There's a million things that you can find
Bartender conversation or a pair of blue eyes, yeah
Your true love or next broken heart
Maybe a party crowd on a Friday night
Long necks, long lines and neon signs, hell
Sometimes that's where it all starts
At the end of a bar
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh
There's a million things that you can find
Bartender conversation or a pair of blue eyes, yeah
Your true love or a next broken heart (or a next broken heart)
Maybe a party crowd on a Friday night
Long necks, long lines and neon signs, hell
Sometimes that's where it all starts
At the end of a bar, oh, oh, yeah
At the end of a-, at the end of a-, at the end of a bar
At the end of a-, at the end of a-, at the end of a bar
(Oh, you know that's right where you start)
You can find your future
Or run into your past
You can look for answers
At the bottom of a glass
