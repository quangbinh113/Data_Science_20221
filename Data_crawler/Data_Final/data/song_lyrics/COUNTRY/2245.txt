Song Name: Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad
I've never seen the inside of a ballroom
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em"
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me
Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like 'em painted up, powdered up, then you oughta be glad
'Cause your good girl's gonna go bad
I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact, you'll hardly recognize your wife
I'll buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life
Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like 'em painted up, powdered up, then you oughta be glad
'Cause your good girl's gonna go bad
Oh yeah, your good girl's gonna go bad
