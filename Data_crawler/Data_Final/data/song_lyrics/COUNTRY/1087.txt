Song Name: San Antonio Stroll - Single Version
When I was a child
Down in south Caroline
Soon's the Saturday sun went on down
My folk's and sister would go
And leave me home all alone
Goin' to that big square dance in town
Well my old radio
Would play that ol' Opry show
So I never got lonesome or blue
I'd fall asleep in my chair
And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through
When my folks would come home
They'd be humming a song
Mamma'd smile and say, "Child don't you know
There ain't a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl
Like the San Antonio stroll"
Well the day finally come
When my momma said, "Hon'
It's 'bout time you came with us as well"
Well, I had me a time
Yes, I danced all night
Till they rang that old cracked midnight bell
Then the lights went down low
The fiddler picked up his bow
And he played something stately and slow
And my sister Eileen and her husband to be
They held hands and began to stroll
I've been away for a while
But it still brings a smile
When I think of the way that it goes
Now I'll sing it to you
Just so we both can do
That ol' San Antonio stroll
Now I'll sing it to you
Just so we both can do
That ol' San Antonio stroll
