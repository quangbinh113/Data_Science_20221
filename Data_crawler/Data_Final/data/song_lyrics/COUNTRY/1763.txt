Song Name: My Maria
My Maria
Don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her
When she's around
She takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer
On a highway in the skies
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you
Bring back my piece of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free
Like a ship sailing on the sea
She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away
My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl, Maria I love you)
I love you
