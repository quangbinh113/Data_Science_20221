Song Name: You and Me
I can hear the rain, it's fallin' softly
As I watch him lyin' next to me
I can feel his heart it's beatin' softly
He just loved me so tenderly
But it should be you and me
When he touches me, I feel your fingers
And each time we kiss, I see your face
When he locks the door behind us
Then he thinks the world can't find us
But he can't see, no he can't see
That it should be you and me
So I'll just close my eyes and dream about you
'Cause every time I dream you're always there
Then you'll lock the door behind us
And in my dreams the world can't find us
It will be so real to me, it's finally you and me
