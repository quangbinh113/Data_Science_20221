Song Name: Red High Heels
Baby, I got plans tonight you don't know nothin' about
I've been sittin' 'round way too long tryin' to figure you out
But you say that you'll call and you don't and I'm spinnin' my wheels
So I'm goin' out tonight in my red high heels
I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend who says still has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town, flaunt him around for everyone to see
Well, you said watch yourself, baby, yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me in my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
All those games you tried to play, well, they ain't gonna work on me now
I put up a barbed wire fence around my heart, baby, just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever, but, baby, get real
I just kicked you to the curb in my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
In my red high heels
In my red high heels
