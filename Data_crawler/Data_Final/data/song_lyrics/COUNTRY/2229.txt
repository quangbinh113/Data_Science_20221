Song Name: Who's Cheatin' Who
Everywhere you look, you can write a book,
On the trouble with a woman an' a man.
But you cannot impose, you can't stick your nose,
Into somethin' that you don't understand.
Still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
I thought I knew him well; I really coudn't tell,
That he had another lover on his mind.
You see, it felt so right when he held me tight,
How could I be so blind?
But still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
Instrumental break.
A heart is on the line each an' every time,
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night.
Though it's wrong all along, it keeps goin' on,
As long as they keep out of sight.
But still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
Still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
Still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
