Song Name: I'm Not Lisa
I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you
'Till the sunlight has touched your face
She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun
And then one winter day, his hand led hers away
She left you here drowning in your tears
Here, where you've stayed for years
Crying, Lisa, Lisa
I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you
'Till the sunlight shines through your face
I'm not Lisa
