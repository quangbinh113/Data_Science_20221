Song Name: All I Needed
I turn the radio on, out come a song I didn't recognize
The way the singer was singing
My heart was connected, I was hypnotized
How can something that I've never heard in my life
Pull me back into the light?
It's a time, it's a place
A lyrical sucker-punch to the face
I was running on empty and life was really getting me down
It was a hook, it was a line
It was a Savior in three-quarter time
I was out there losing my mind
When all I needed was a song
It was a spiritual change, I'm no longer the same
Yeah, I've turned a page
In one afternoon, a three minute tune was my coming of age
Its transformative power, I began to devour
Every painstaking word
It's a time, it's a place
A lyrical sucker-punch to the face
I was running on empty and life was really getting me down
It was a hook, it was a line
It was a savior in three-quarter time
I was out there losing my mind
When all I needed was a song
It's a time, it's a place
A lyrical sucker-punch to the face
I was running on empty and life was really getting me down
It was a hook, it was a line
It was a savior in three-quarter time
I was out there losing my mind
When all I needed was a song
I was out there losing my mind
When all I needed was a song
