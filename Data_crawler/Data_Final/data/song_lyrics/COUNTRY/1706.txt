Song Name: Soul Sweet Song
After the tears and the spate of lonely days
After the noon-born shadows slowly faded
After your heavy stone was rolled away
Rollin', rollin'
That's when it finally came to me
Now there's no use wishin' for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the mornin' sun
And I hear you on the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm movin' me
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
Isn't it a wonder how things change?
I was cryin' now, I'm laughin' through the pourin' rain
Everything that's old is new again
Oh, that feelin'
Can't help but hear the harmony
Now there's no use wishin' for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the mornin' sun
And I hear you on the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm movin' me
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
Now there's no use wishin' for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the mornin' sun
And I hear you on the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm movin' me
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
In the memory of your melody
When the dawn breaks out, the birds all sing
And I feel your rhythm movin' me
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
(See you in the morning sun)
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
(Hear you on the whispering wind)
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
(Feel the rhythm moving me)
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singin'
