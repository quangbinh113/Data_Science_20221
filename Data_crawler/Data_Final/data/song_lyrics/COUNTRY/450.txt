Song Name: Gimmie That Girl
Hang up that red dress
Let down your hair
Cancel those reservations
There's no need to go nowhere
As good as you're lookin' right now
Girl, I bet you're thinkin' I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me
Gimmie that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimmie that girl
Gimmie that girl lovin' up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimmie that girl
Gimmie the girl that's beautiful
Without a trace of makeup of on
Barefoot in the kitchen
Singin' her favorite song
Dancin' around like a fool
Starrin' in her own little show
Gimmie the girl that the rest of the world
Ain't lucky enough to know
Gimmie that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimmie that girl
Gimmie that girl lovin' up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimmie that girl, gimmie that girl
Gimmie that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimmie that girl
Gimmie that girl lovin' up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimmie that girl, gimmie that girl
