Song Name: If I May Be So Bold
It's no eternal mystery
You don't need a hard-earned clue
Why some men do their damndest when half-a-damn would do
There's a lifetime in the distance
And it's filled with love and gold
And I'll find it yet if I may be so bold
Yeah, some men do the congaroo
And some men do the wheel
Some'll do most anything to hide the way they feel
And some like givin' orders
And some like to be told
But I'll make my way if I may be so bold
Bold enough to make a difference
Bold enough to say I care
Bold enough to keep on trying
Even when the will's not there
There's a whole world out there waitin'
Full of stories to be told
And I'll heed the call and tell 'em all
If I may be so bold
The boys were emptying their glasses
As the true believers will
For what I guess these days passes for a good time or a thrill
And they're tryin' hard to convince you
But I don't believe you're sold
So I'll step right up if I may be so bold
Bold enough to make a difference
Bold enough to say I care
Bold enough to keep on fightin'
Even when the will's not there
There's a whole world out there waitin'
Full of dreams that can't be sold
And I'll heed the call and I'll live 'em all
If I may be so bold
I have stumbled 'round these country towns
And I've swallowed up the sea
I've wrestled with the question of just who I aim to be
Been dealt hands I had to laugh at
And some hands I'd like to fold
But I'll play 'em all, if I may be so bold
Bold enough to not surrender
Bold enough to give a damn
Bold enough to keep on movin'
Or to stay right where I am
There's a whole world out there waitin'
Full of stories to be told
And I'll heed the call and I'll tell 'em all
If I may be so bold
Yeah I'll tell 'em all, if I may be so bold
