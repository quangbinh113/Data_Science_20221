Song Name: From the Ground Up
Oh-oh-oh
Grandma and grandpa
Painted a picture of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory, more than saying "I do"
Kiss you goodnights and "I love yous"
Me and you, baby, we'll walk in their footsteps
Build our own family one day at a time
Ten little toes, a painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever, it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better, and I will be all you need
Besides you, I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll, the Earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever, it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better, and I will be all you need
Besides you, I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh
Someday we'll wake up
With thousands of pictures of 65 years in this little house
I won't trade for nothing, the life that we built
I'll kiss you goodnight, and say I love you still
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better, and I will be all you need
Besides you, I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Oh-oh
From the ground up
Oh-oh-oh-oh
