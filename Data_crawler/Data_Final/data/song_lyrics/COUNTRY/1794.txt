Song Name: Burn It Down - 717 Tapes
Storm's a-comin'
I can feel it in my bones but I ain't runnin'
I been runnin' way too long
I'm sick and so damn tired
But you can't put out this fire
I'm gonna burn this whole world down, yeah
I'm gonna burn this whole world down
I'd bet everything
There's a lot of folks like me
Cuttin' off the puppet string
And breakin' out the gasoline
Once you strike that match
There ain't no turnin' back
I'm gonna burn this whole world down, yeah
I'm gonna burn this whole world down
I'm gonna burn this whole world down, yeah
I'm gonna burn this whole world down, oh
Gonna watch it burn down
