Song Name: Pay No Rent
I hear the clicking of the dominoes, you shaking up a game
And if we lose a hand I bet I'll know just who's to blame
But if we hit 21, if we make that call
I bet I'll sit here in my chair just feeling ten feet tall
And we're caught up in the riff-raff, circling 'round the sun
It takes a whole lot of blood and tears just to really love someone
But when it comes back around, that's heaven on earth
You never know till the end my friend what your love is really worth
Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well to do?
I've traveled round and I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
Well in my heart you pay no rent
Well in my heart you pay no rent
I hear the crackle of a campfire, you're howling at the moon
We all know that you gotta go, but does it have to be so soon?
Bet somebody's yelling last call, I hope you get some rest
I hope you found everything that you
Wanted in the place you love the best
Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well to do?
I've traveled round and I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
Well in my heart you pay no rent
Well in my heart you pay no rent
Now we're shaking up the dominoes beneath the neon light
Knowing anybody else out there couldn't put up a better fight
But the fighting time's over and it's all gone
You pick up the pieces and we try to carry on
Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well to do?
I've traveled round and I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
Well in my heart you pay no rent
Don't cost you nothing, not a single cent
Time together well is time well spent
In my heart you pay no rent
In my heart you pay no rent
