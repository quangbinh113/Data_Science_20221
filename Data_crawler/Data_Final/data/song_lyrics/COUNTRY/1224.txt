Song Name: Road Runner
I plucked a feather from my tail
Write you a letter babe
But I can't find a well
Ain't got no parchment or pen
Feel like a rooster baby, without a hen
Well I'm a
Road runner
Running down that road again
Road runner
Honey catch me if you can
There ain't no coyote in sight
I'm howling at the moon
Yeah, and I can't sleep at night
My little darlin can't you see
Your whispers louder than the highways calling me
Well I'm a
Road runner
Running down that road again
Road runner
Honey catch me if you can
I hope the next gig ain't too bad
Picking through seeds at the bottom of the bag
Ol Solly Levine's on the way
Laying down the white lines
And I can't turn away.
Road runner
Running down that road again
Road runner
Honey catch me if you can
Well I'm a
Road runner
Running down that road again
Road runner
Honey catch me if you can
