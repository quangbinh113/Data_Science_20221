Song Name: Don't Tell Me How to Drink (feat. Chris Stapleton)
I'm all in to live and let live
And mindin' my own
So when you tell me I have had enough
It kinda rubs me wrong
Well, I appreciate your concern
But I got a little fuse left to burn
Don't tell me how to drink
Don't tell me how to lose my mind
Just 'cause I'm this country boy
Can still rock and roll 'til it's closin' time
Brother, I've spilled more on a barroom floor
Than you've ever had
So let me do my thing
And don't tell me how to drink
Now you could say
I'm not the man I used to be
There's things I did
That I can't do as frequently
But don't be talkin' at me like a fool
And think I won't take your ass to school
Don't tell me how to drink
Don't tell me how to lose my mind
Just 'cause I'm this country boy
Can still rock and roll 'til it's closin' time
Brother, I've spilled more on a barroom floor
Than you've ever had
So let me do my thing
And don't tell me how to drink
Don't tell me how to drink
Don't tell me how to lose my mind
Just 'cause I'm this country boy
Can still rock and roll 'til it's closin' time
Brother, I've spilled more on the barroom floor
Than you've ever had
So let me do my thing
Don't tell me how to drink
