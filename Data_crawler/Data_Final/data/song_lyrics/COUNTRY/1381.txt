Song Name: Heartbreak Heaven
She took off to where God knows
And I took off on down the road
And I went lookin' for a sign
Came in the form of a neon light
I heard a voice say "it's never too late"
Park the truck and went and swang the gate
And from wide open, had a revelation
And finally made it
Where the beer stays cold
And there ain't no strangers
And you can dance up close
To one of those honky tonk angels
Everybody's gettin' on a long black train
Raise a little hell where there ain't no pain
At the paradise where hearts will learn hard lessons
A little place called heartbreak heaven
It ain't no mansion in the sky
It's a hole in the wall off highway five
First stop love goes when it dies
To put the hurt on ice
Where the beer stays cold
And there ain't no strangers
And you can dance up close
To one of those honky tonk angels
Everybody's gettin' on a long black train
Raise a little hell where there ain't no pain
At the paradise where hearts will learn hard lessons
A little place called heartbreak heaven (woo)
Won't you see
What you see
You won't ever want to leave
Where the beer stays cold
And there ain't no strangers
And you can dance up close
To one of those honky tonk angels
Everybody's gettin' on a long black train
Raise a little hell where there ain't no pain
At the paradise where hearts will learn hard lessons
Where I lose at countin' rounds and all my blessings
A little place called heartbreak heaven
Yeah
Mmm, heartbreak heaven (it ain't so bad, ain't it?)
