Song Name: If I Could Make a Living
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
Early every mornin' when the sun comes up
I'm punchin' that clock on the wall
Breakin' my back just to make a buck
Wishin' I was in your arms
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I could work all day and feel right at home
Lovin' that eight to five
Never have to leave you here alone
When I'm workin' overtime
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
