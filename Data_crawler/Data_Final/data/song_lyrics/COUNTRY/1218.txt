Song Name: Hicktown
You like the way that sounds?
Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin' up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are getting pretty, sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight
Down at the football game, yeah
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way
We get down in a Hicktown
Well, you can see the neighbour's butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman's smokin', Pall Mall's watchin' Laura In galls
And granny's getting lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin'
Down on Blue Hole Road, ah you know, you know
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way
We get down in a Hicktown
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boon docks, we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way
We get down
Oh, oh, we let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It's buck wild, yeah, but that's the way
We get down in a Hicktown
In a Hicktown
It's the way we get down
In a Hicktown
Yeah, in a Hicktown
Ah, we ain't finished yet
Got your country boys and your red neck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in Hicktown, yeah, in Hicktown
The whole town is gettin' down
Yeah, we let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It's buck wild, yeah, but that's the way
We get down in a Hicktown
In a Hicktown
It's the way we get down
Ah, take it home
