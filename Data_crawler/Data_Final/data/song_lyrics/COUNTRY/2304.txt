Song Name: Fire on the Mountain
Took my family away from my Carolina home
Had dreams about the West and started to roam
Six long months on a dust-covered trail
They say heaven's at the end, but so far, it's been hell
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
We were diggin' and siftin' from five 'til five
Sellin' everything we found just to stay alive
Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars
Sinnin' was the big thing, Lord, and Satan was the star
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
Dance hall girls were the evenin' treat
Empty cartridges and blood lines the gutters of the street
Men were shot down for the sake of fun
Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four guns
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
Now my widow, she weeps by my grave
Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
All for a useless and no-good worthless claim
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
Fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
Waitin' for me there
