Song Name: It's A Little Too Late - 1996 Greatest Hits Version
Well, early this morning, it dawned on me
The kinda man she needed me to be
She made a list and laid it there, beside me on the bed
Now what I should've done keeps running through my head
Oh, I should've done this and I should've done that
I should've been there, then she'd have never left
I should've been hanging on every word she ever had to say
But it's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change, but it's a little too late
Last night, I came home at a quarter 'til three
And to my surprise, she wasn't mad at me
I thought she'd finally realized not to worry I'd be home
And then I realized this morning, she was gone
Oh, I should've done this, and I should've done that
I should've been there, then she'd have never left
I should've been hanging on every word she ever had to say
But it's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change, but it's a little too late
But it's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change, but it's a little too late
Right now, would be the time to change, but it's a little too late
