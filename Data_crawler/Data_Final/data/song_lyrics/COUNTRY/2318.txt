Song Name: Southbound
Well I'm southbound, Lord I'm comin' home to you
Lord I'm southbound, baby, Lord I'm comin' home to you
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues
Well I been workin' every night, travelin' every day
Oh I been workin' every night, traveling every day
You can tell your other man, sweet daddy's on his way
(Oh! You better believe)
Well I'm southbound
Whoa I'm southbound, baby
Oh, you better tell your other man, sweet daddy's on his way
Got your hands full now baby, as soon as I hit that door
Got your hands full now woman, Lord soon as I hit that door
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before
Lord, I'm southbound
Whoa southbound, baby
Oh!
Oh Lord, I'm southbound, yeah baby
I'm gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before
