Song Name: Folsom Prison Blues - Live at Folsom State Prison, Folsom, CA - January 1968
I hear the train a-comin'
It's rollin 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone
When I was just a baby
My mama told me, son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry
Suey!
I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
They're probably drinking coffee
And smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures meï¿¼
Well, if they freed me fom this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away
