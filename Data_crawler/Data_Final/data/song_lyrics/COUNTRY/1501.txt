Song Name: Any Other Guy
Well it's been two years
And I feel about the same
I thought with time we were bound to change
I mean I guess you have, you just got worse
And I'm still hoping that we could work
You moved on again but I bet you'll be back
'Cause you come crawling when you're bored of what you have
I just wish I didn't cave so easy
And I could leave you the way you leave me
But you sleep just fine in your bed at night
Though I'm all wrapped around your finger so tight
I tried to step away, you dragged me back
But when it comes to you I don't know how to act
So many people that I passed by
So many people that I deny
But no matter what I do
No matter what I try
It doesn't feel the same with any other guy
When I was lost you came back around again
And I thought this time it would never end
But I was wrong just like before
Now just to hear your name cuss me to the core
You think about now I've had enough
Especially when I had to dance rough
But the only way I can let you go
Is if I made it to the end or I sell my soul
But you sleep just fine in your bed at night
Though I'm all wrapped around your finger so tight
I tried to step away, you dragged me back
But when it comes to you I don't know how to act
So many people that I passed by
So many people that I deny
But no matter what I do
No matter what I try
It doesn't feel the same with any other guy
No matter what I do
No matter what I try
I'm still horning about that look in your eyes
No matter what I do
No matter what I try
You're never really gone even when you say goodbye
No matter what I do
No matter what I try
It doesn't feel the same
With any other guy
'Cause you sleep just fine in your bed at night
Though I'm all wrapped around your finger so tight
I tried to step away, you dragged me back
'Cause when it comes to you I don't know how to act
So many people that I passed by
So many people that I deny
But no matter what I do
No matter what I try
It doesn't feel the same with any other guy
It doesn't feel the same with any other guy
