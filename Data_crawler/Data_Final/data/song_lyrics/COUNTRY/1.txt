Song Name: What My World Spins Around
I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close
To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring
And I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring, and
I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
What my world spins around
Oh, yeah
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring, and
I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
You're what my world spins around
What my world spins around
