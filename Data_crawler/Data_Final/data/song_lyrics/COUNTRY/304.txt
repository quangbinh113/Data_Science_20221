Song Name: Sangria
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hook bar
Trying to remember what number we are
String of white lights makin' your eyes shine tonight
We're buzzin' like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is beggin' to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Recking ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holdin' your shoes, wearin' my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss
We're buzzin' like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is beggin' to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Only thing I want to do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinnin', spinnin' around
We're buzzin' like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is beggin' to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Only thing I want to do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinnin', spinnin' around
