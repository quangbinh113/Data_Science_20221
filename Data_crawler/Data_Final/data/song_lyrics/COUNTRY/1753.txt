Song Name: Somebody Like You
There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good
To finally feel the way I do
Now I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing
The only thing I wanna do, mmhmm
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shinin' down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do
I used to run in circles goin' no where fast
I'd take a one step forward and a two steps back
I couldn't walk a straight line
Even if I wanted to

I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
Whoa, here we go now
Woo! Yeah
Hey! I wanna love you baby
Uh huh
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shinin' down on me and you
When you put your arms around me, oh
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do
Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
But you're teachin' me to be a better man
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do
No, no
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you
And I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you, yeah
Hey, I wanna love you baby
Woo!
Oh, oh
Yeah
Oh, I wanna be around in the middle of the night
Shinin' like it's true
I wanna be the man that you run to, whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah
Hey, I wanna love you baby
Oh, oh, yeah yeah
