Song Name: Follow Your Arrow
If you save yourself for marriage
You're a bore
You don't save yourself for marriage
You're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink
Then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk
As soon as you down the first one
If you can't lose the weight
Then you're just fat
But if you lose too much
Then you're on crack
You're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do
Whatever you want
So, make lots of noise (hey)
Kiss lots of boys (yup)
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points
If you don't go to church
You'll go to hell
If you're the first one on the front row
You're self-righteous son of a-
Can't win for losin'
You'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em
So, make lots of noise (hey)
Kiss lots of boys (yup)
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points
Say what you think (Say what you think)
Love who you love (Love who you love)
'Cause you just get so many trips 'round the sun
Yeah, you only
Only live once
So make lots of noise (hey)
Kiss lots of boys (yup)
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points
