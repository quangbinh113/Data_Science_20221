Song Name: Redneck Crazy
Gonna drive like hell through your neighborhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank, sit on the hood, and drank
I'm about to get my pissed off on
I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby and drove me redneck crazy
I wish I knew how long it's been going on
How long you've been getting some on the side
Now, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well he won't be getting any sleep tonight
I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby and drove me redneck crazy, yeah
Redneck crazy
Did you think I'd wish you both the best, endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am
I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M.
I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You gone and broke the wrong heart baby and drove me redneck crazy, yeah
You drove me redneck crazy, oh yeah yeah
