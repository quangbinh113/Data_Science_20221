Song Name: More Me
Need a lot more, need a lot more me
Dust the cobwebs off the black dress in my closet
I'm shaking out my studded boots
I was free and wild 'til you put me in your pocket
Honey, now I'm cutting loose
'Cause you dim my shine and you kill my vibe
I was caught up underneath you
Taking back what's mine
'Cause I realized I don't need you
It's time I put you in the rearview
You can kiss my tail lights
Middle finger out the window
Swear that I won't think twice
Need a little less of your big ego
And your small truck energy
I need a little less you
And lot more and a lot more me
So tonight we'll throw a going away party
To celebrate you being gone (ooh)
No more pretending that I like your fancy whiskey
Pour tequila all night long
Put your records all in a goodwill box
And we turned up some Shania (turn it up)
Yeah, your old guitar
Made a good start for the fire
It's time I put you in the rearview
You can kiss my tail lights
Middle finger out the window
Swear that I won't think twice
Need a little less of your big ego
And your small truck energy
I need a little less you
And lot more and a lot more me (hey)
Yeah, a lot more me
Yeah, a lot more, yeah, a lot more me
Time I put you in the rearview
You can kiss my tail lights
Middle finger out the window (out the window)
And kiss your ass goodbye
Need a little less of your big ego
And your small truck energy
I need a little less you (yeah, a little less you)
And lot more and a lot more me (hey, hey)
Yeah, a lot more me
Yeah, a lot more
Yeah, a lot more me
Yeah, a lot more me
