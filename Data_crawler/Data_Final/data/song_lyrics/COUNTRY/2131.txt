Song Name: From Austin
There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you
I'm just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were napping on my arms, on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell
It's about time that I left Austin
About time, you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
It's about time that I face
The hard times I've let go
Love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float
Do you remember getting drunk
On the outskirts of this town?
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight
It's about time that I left Austin
About time that you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
About time that I face
The hard times I've let go
Love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float
Float
Float
There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you
I'm just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
And I'm finally gone from Austin
You finally settled down
With a man who didn't move as quick
As the trains that rolled through town
I finally had to face
The hard times I've let go
If loving you's an ocean
I'd have drowned so you could float
