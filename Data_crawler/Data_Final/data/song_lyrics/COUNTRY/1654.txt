Song Name: Backwater Blues
Be kind to me
Ain't got nobody, ain't got no one to look after me
I didn't choose this life, but it chose me
The more the tide rolls in, time rolls away from me
On a river bank
Ain't never taken anything that don't belong to me
But when she decides to return, she'll take everything she sees
A copperhead might strike you dead before you've seen anything
Oh, mama, seems like the water's been ten feet high
And I just don't understand why it makes me cry
If I can keep it together 'til the spring
When that damn river runs dry
I'll count my blessings, just like the stars
That are in the sky
When it all comes down
I'll be here to clean up and claim my ground
You wouldn't know Mother Nature's power if she never made a sound
I can't be too proud, she got me cryin' out loud
Oh, mama, seems like the water's been ten feet high
And I just don't understand why it makes me cry
If I can keep it together 'til the spring
When that damn river runs dry
I'll count my blessings, just like the stars
That are in the sky
I'll count my blessings, just like the stars
That are in the sky
