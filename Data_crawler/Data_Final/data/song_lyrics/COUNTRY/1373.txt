Song Name: the mockingbird & THE CROW
I grew up in a little town named after another
Catchin' bass and cuttin' grass was how I spent my summers
I know it sounds cliché, but it's how I was raised
And I got my first guitar from a pawn shop off of Poplar
Picked up "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Smoke On The Water"
And that's what got me out
It's crazy thinkin' now
I'm a mockingbird
Singin' songs that sound like other songs you've heard
Like Friday nights and headlights on some backroad red dirt
And how Mississippi's home
I've always been a mockingbird, but now I'm a mockingbird with a microphone, yeah
I found myself a contract down on Sixteenth Avenue
Writing songs for anyone about anything I knew
And I've come a long long way
But one thing hasn't changed
I'm a mockingbird
Singing songs that sound like other songs you've heard
Like Friday nights and headlights on some backroad red dirt
And how Mississippi's homе
I've always been a mockingbird, but now I'm a mockingbird with a microphone, hmm
A mockingbird with a microphone
Ooh, with a microphonе, with a microphone, with a microphone
Do this, do that
That shirt, this hat
Don't forget to smile
Kiss the ring once in a while
Don't say those words
Put down your finger
Throw in a slow love song or two
Well, fuck that, and fuck you 'cause
The way I sing may not be pretty
May not be music to your ears
But when these wings roll through your city
My last name is all you hear
And I refuse to be another
Mockingbird with a microphone
I'll fly the line I choose to, brother
Even if that makes me the crow, the crow, the crow
Even if that makes me the crow, the crow, the crow, the crow
Well, do that, do this
Unclench your fist
You're too loud, you're too proud, it won't work
Well, tell that to 25 thousand rednecks with my dumb face on their T-shirt
The way I sing may not be pretty
May not be music to your ears
But when these wings roll through your city
My last name is all you hear
And I refuse to be another
Mockingbird with a microphone
I'll fly the line I choose to, brother
Even if that makes me the crow, the crow, the crow
Even if that makes me the crow, the crow, the crow, the crow
I'm a mockingbird
Singing songs that sound like other songs you've heard
Like Friday nights and headlights on some backroad red dirt
And how Mississippi's home
I've always been a mockingbird, but now I'm a mockingbird and I'm the crow
