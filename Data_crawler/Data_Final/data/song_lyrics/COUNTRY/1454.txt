Song Name: Dear Rodeo
Dear rodeo
I'd be lying if I tried to tell you I don't think about you
After all the miles and the wild nights that we've been through
Lord knows, we had a few
Dear rodeo
I'd like to say that I took the reigns and rode away
No regrets, no left-unsaids, just turn the page
Oh, but you know better, babe
'Tween the almost-had-'ems and broken bones
The dream of a buckle I'll never put on
I'm jaded
Woah, I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'd do it all again, even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go
So dear rodeo
I'm tried like hell to tell myself it was all your fault
I held on tight with all my might, I just couldn't hang on
And that's hard to hang your hat on
'Tween the almost-had-'ems and broken bones
The dream of a buckle I'll never put on
I'm jaded
Woah, how I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'd do it all again, even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go
Dear rodeo
I'd like to think you miss me too, but I know you don't
Oh, but that won't change the past, and that don't change the truth
I'm still in love with you
Dear rodeo
