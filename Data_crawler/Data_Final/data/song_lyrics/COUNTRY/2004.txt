Song Name: We Did
I smell the rain on the grass
Mixing in with the wind and my perfume
In that old Pontiac
Pushing the limits and breaking curfew
I wrote your name in graffiti
Small-town style on the bridge
You made falling so easy
Even now when I kiss your lips
The stars start falling like Heaven is crying
We're laying on the hood with the thunder and the lightning
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did whatever we wanted
Didn't we, baby? Fall like lovers and love like crazy
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did
We did
Flickering front-porch lights
You sneaking out in your white Chuck Taylors
Hot as the Fourth of July
To this day, you're the same heartbreaker that makes the
The stars start falling like Heaven is crying
We're laying on the hood with the thunder and the lightning
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did whatever we wanted
Didn't we, baby? Fall like lovers and love like crazy
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did
They say young love don't last forever
But we did
They say young love don't last forever
But we did
The stars start falling like Heaven is crying
We're laying on the hood with the thunder and the lightning
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did whatever we wanted
Didn't we, baby? Fall like lovers and love like crazy
We didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did
We did
We didn't know any better
Oh, we didn't know any better, wouldn't care if we did
Didn't know we had forever, but we did
We did
