Song Name: jackson
He said I'm saving up to buy you a diamond
He said it won't be much but I'll get you one soon
I thought we'd be married in a fever
I thought we'd ride off like Johnny and June
But I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
No I don't think we'll make it that far
No I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
As long as you keep breaking my heart
Empty promises around every corner
I can barely see the light in your eyes
You say you're wrong and you say you'll change
But your heartbreak lips remain the same
And they're too good at tellin' lies
Well it takes a lot of pain and time
To change a woman's mind
But I've reached the point of no return
And you crossed that line
So I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
No I don't think we'll make it that far
No I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
As long as you keep breaking my heart
Well it takes a lot of pain and time
To change a woman's mind
But I've reached the point of no return
And you crossed that line
So I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
No I don't think we'll make it that far
No I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
As long as you keep breaking
No I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
No I don't think we'll make it that far
No I don't think we'll make it to Jackson
As long as you keep breaking
Oh my heart
Yeah
He said I'm saving up to buy you a diamond
