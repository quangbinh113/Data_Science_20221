Song Name: Home
Another Christmas Day
Will come and go away
And I've got so far to go
But I wanna go home
I need to go home
Maybe surrounded by strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I wanna go home
God, I miss you ya know?
And see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you are no further than a call away
A call could never be the same
Another Christmas Day
Will come and go away
Now I wanna go home
I've got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna go home
Whatever they need me for
I know that I need you more
So I'll do the things I gotta do to get back to you
I'll make it back by Christmas Day
Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Mhhhhh
A million people, I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh I miss you, you know
I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
