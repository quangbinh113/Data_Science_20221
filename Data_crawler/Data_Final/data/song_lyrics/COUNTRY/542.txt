Song Name: That Ain't My Truck
(Verse one)
She's been going out with him
She's been going out with me
Said she'd let us know by tonight which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house, and sure enough...
(Chorus)
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl, my whole world
But that ain't my truck
(Verse two)
I pulled over by the curb
I've been sitting here all night
Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right
I thought of breaking down the door
But there's nothing left to say
That Chevy 4x4 says it all
Sitting in my place
(Chorus)
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord, this don't look good at all
That's my girl
My whole world
But that ain't my truck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl
My whole world
But that ain't my truck
That's my girl
My whole world
But that ain't my truck
That's my girl... my whole world...(repeat to fade)
