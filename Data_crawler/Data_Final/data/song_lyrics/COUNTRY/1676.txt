Song Name: The Man from Waco
The mirage of Del Rio, it was burning in his eyes
And sleep had escaped him, too consumed by his pride
Like the lonesome and high country, he was lost in a haze
And the thoughts of what he'd do if he unloaded all his rage
The man from Waco
The city was almost silent as he passed the humming signs
On the corner he heard laughter, made him afraid of what he'd find
He pushed through the door, hypnotized by a sound
Just then tears overcame him and his heart began to drown
The man from Waco
It was there that he shot her while the lovers were embraced
With the bullet he intended for the man who took his place
He cried through the night as he made his escape
But the rain that was fallin' could not wash away his shame
The man from Waco
On the banks of the Brazos, where the desert willow grows
The clear shallow water just won't say all it knows
A moment of burning anger can curse the living through the days
You can let that river take you, but you will never get away
The man from Waco
