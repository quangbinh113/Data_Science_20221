Song Name: Shine Out
Sky fading to black
Sun is setting deep
Nothing to hear but my
Well my lonesome heart beat
Not a whisper of wind
No moon in the sky
Just airplane lights and stars
Of 1,000 times
Let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about all of those times
That we had it out
Let the light shine out
Gravel roads and city streets
Always lead you to me
You just stop right there in your tracks
And turn the car around
Then you burn the ground
We'll let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about all of those times
That we had it out
Let the light...
Oh, grass will burn it'll grow again
Greener than it was than it's ever been
Just got to give it time
Oh love is true but not for you
Not for me it's easy to see
We'll just let it be
Let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about all of those times
That we had it out
Let the light shine out
Let the light shine out...
