Song Name: Like A Lady
Lady
Lady
Boy, I'm not the kinda girl to go
And fight for all your attention, mm-mm
I'm not too afraid to call this off
And go see what I've been missin', mm-mm
Leave the dress at home 'cause it makes me too polite
No more waitin' by the phone
I'm steppin' out tonight
'Cause I feel like a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music, playin' all night long
Yeah, I'm feelin' right, I'm livin' my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady
Treat myself to what's up on the highest shelf
I want it, I get it, mm-mm
I might look like I'm lonely, but I'm only lovin' every minute
Ooh, baby
Leave the heels at home, 'cause they never do me right
Go out dancin' on my own
Man, these heels don't lie
'Cause I feel like a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music, playin' all night long
Yeah, I'm feelin' right, I'm livin' my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady
Feel like a lady, a lady, yeah-yeah
Might change my hair and change my mind
Might change your whole damn life
Might break your heart, and not think twice, that's right
I'm a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music, playin' all night long
I'm feelin' right, I'm livin' my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady, yeah
(I feel like, I feel like a lady)
(I feel like) I feel like (I feel like a lady) I feel like a lady
(I feel like, I feel like a lady) like a lady
(I feel like) lady
