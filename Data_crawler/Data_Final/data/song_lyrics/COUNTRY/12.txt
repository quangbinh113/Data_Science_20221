Song Name: Hero
Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight with everyone else
You're a masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
Maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be your big man
I just wanna fight with everyone else
You're a masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
