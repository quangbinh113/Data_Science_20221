Song Name: Wishful Drinking (with Sam Hunt)
Maybe I'm just wishful drinkin'
Give my heart somethin' to sink in
Better make it two, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I know it's a shot in the dark
Lookin' for what's left of a spark
Throwin' 'em back like I got nothin' to lose
It's a slow burn just like you
Everybody says, "Give it time"
But I'm feelin' like I'm stuck on rewind
Throwin' 'em back like I got nothin' to lose
It's a slow burn just like you
When I'm a couple in, I get optimistic
Like you and me are realistic
Maybe I'm just wishful drinkin'
Give my heart somethin' to sink in
Better make it two, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I get hopeful whеn I'm tipsy
Thinkin' you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I'm wishful drinkin' (ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
With еvery sip I'm gettin' closer
To thinkin' that we ain't really over
I know it ain't right but baby, just for tonight
I don't wanna have no closure
When I'm a couple in, I get optimistic
Like you and me are realistic
Maybe I'm just wishful drinkin'
Give my heart somethin' to sink in
Better make it two, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I get hopeful when I'm tipsy
Thinkin' you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I'm wishful drinkin' (ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah, I'm wishful drinkin', wishful drinkin'
Wishful drinkin', wishful drinkin'
I'm tracin' your footprints through my memories
Tryna find where we went wrong
Replacin' the space you left with new things
Nothin' I try lasts long
Maybe I'm just wishful drinkin'
Give my heart somethin' to sink in
Better make it two, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you (another round of me and you)
I get hopeful when I'm tipsy (when I'm tipsy)
Thinkin' you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothin' I won't do
For another round of me and you
I'm wishful drinkin' (ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah
I'm wishful drinkin'
I'm wishful drinkin'
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
