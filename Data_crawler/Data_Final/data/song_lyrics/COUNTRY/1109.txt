Song Name: Run
Bloodshot eyes on a balcony
A bottle of whiskey and his hands all over me
I was looking for the fire escape
You showed up without a second to waste
What if we run? What if we get away?
There ain't a single reason for us to stay
Can we fly somewhere foreign?
Get me high, mess me up until the morning
'Cause all I see in every street is where he made me numb
There's gotta be somewhere
Somewhere we can run, we can run
So many places that I ain't been
All I know is I was living my life for him
We could fly, we could leave this town
Bury these memories that been holding us down
Can we fly somewhere foreign?
Get me high, mess me up until the morning
'Cause all I see in every street is where he made me numb
There's gotta be somewhere
Somewhere we can run, we can run
You and me staring at a southern sky
Dreaming of any place we could be tonight
Can we fly somewhere foreign?
Get me high, mess me up until the morning
'Cause all I see in every street is where he made me numb
There's gotta be somewhere
Somewhere we can run, we can run
Somewhere we can run, we can run
