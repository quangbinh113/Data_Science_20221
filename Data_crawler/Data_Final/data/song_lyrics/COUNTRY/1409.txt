Song Name: Call It Country
You call it a county line
I call it a first sign
That I got two lefts left and one right to mama's front porch
You call it a dirt road
I call it the view from my window
From the yellow wild flowers all the way up to that barn red door
You see gravel
I see a shortcut
You see a hand me down
I see a good truck
To roll to the boondocks
And go get my tires stuck
It's where my soul's
Got roots that won't let go
No matter where I roam
Where I come from always finds me
Takes me back to those memories
Sipping on summertime sweet tea
Swinging on a firestone
You call it country
I call it home
(I call it home)
I call it home
(I call it home)
You call it a honky tonk
I call it my first job
Mama in the cover band, me side stage just singing along
You see a tailgate
I see a first kiss
You see a cornfield
I see a harvest
Sunrise sun dress
Moonlight shine sip
It's where my soul's
Got roots that won't let go
No matter where I roam
Where I come from always finds me
Takes me back to those memories
Sipping on summertime sweet tea
Swinging on a firestone
You call it country
I call it home
(I call it home)
I call it home
(I call it home)
So if you're ever rollin in on a whim on a Friday night
Just follow that neon Pabst Blue welcome sign
Yeah
It's where my soul's
Got roots that won't let go
No matter where I roam
Where I come from always finds me
Takes me back to those memories
Sipping on summertime sweet tea
Swinging on a firestone
You call it country
I call it home
You see the back woods
I see a playground
You see a map dot
I see where my heart's found
I call it home
