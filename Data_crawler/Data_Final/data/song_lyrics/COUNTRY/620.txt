Song Name: Nobody Wins
You said this ain't over yet
I've said things that I'll regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal
Before another bitter word gets used
I was hoping we could call a truce
'Cause nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again
Nobody wins, slammin' doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
'Cause nobody wins
Darlin', we got too much pride
It don't matter whose wrong or right
Honey, love ain't black and white
It's the way I feel bout you
All I want to do is hold you tight
I can't take another angry night
Nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again
Nobody wins, slammin' doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
'Cause nobody wins
I know something's 'bout to break if we don't bend
Baby, what's it gonna take
Nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again
Nobody wins, slammin' doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
'Cause nobody wins
Nobody wins, nobody wins
Nobody wins
