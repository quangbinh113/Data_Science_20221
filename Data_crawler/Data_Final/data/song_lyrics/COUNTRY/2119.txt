Song Name: Till the End
If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you till the end
And if my broken hearted love don't find a way to mend
I'll go on loving you till the end
The years and miles may separate you from me
The pain may lessen more as time goes by
But as for me memories will never fade
And I'll go on loving you till the end
If we're ever free to love again I know
Straight to your waiting arms is where I'll go
And there's I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you till the end
I'll go on loving you till the end
