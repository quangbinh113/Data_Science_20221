Song Name: Intertwined
Your mom called me today and it was so out of the blue
Haven't talked to her since the last time I saw you
Could hear it in her voice that she's been missing you too
It's weird not going over there anymore
A couple years disappeared with one goodbye
I'm staying clear of going near those streets we'd drive
Your memory follows me and I can't hide
It hurts not being with you anymore
It's not as easy as out of sight out of mind
It's not as easy as leaving it all behind
In everything therе's a string that's still tied
We said goodbye but wе're still intertwined
We're still intertwined
I'm trying to be strong but I'm hanging by a thread
Just like that old sweatshirt that you left here on my bed
Been seeing someone new but I'm not over you, yeah
It's strange not being with you anymore
A couple years disappear just like that
I wish that I could live my life and not look back
A part of me will always be wherever you're at
But it's hard to move on when you love somebody like that, yeah
It's not as easy as out of sight out of mind
It's not as easy as leaving it all behind
In everything there's a string that's still tied
We said goodbye but we're still intertwined
We're still intertwined
Everytime that I try to move on with me
Everyday every night you're in everything
There's a piece of my heart that is still missing
And the time ain't healing anything
It's not as easy as out of sight out of mind
It's not as easy as leaving it all behind
In everything there's a string that's still tied
We said goodbye but we're still intertwined
We're still intertwined
(A couple years disappear just like that)
