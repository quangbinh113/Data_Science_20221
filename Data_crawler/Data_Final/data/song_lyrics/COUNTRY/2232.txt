Song Name: Guys Do It All the Time
Got in this morning at 4 a.m.
You're as mad as you can be
Well I was drinking and talking and you know how that goes
Time just slipped away from me
By the time I knew what time it was
It was too late to call home
Stop carrying on acting like a child
I wasn't doing anything wrong
Guys do it all the time
And you expect us to understand
When the shoe's on the other foot
You know that's when it hits the fan
Get over it, honey, life's a two way street
Or you won't be a man of mine
Sure I had some beers with the girls last night
Guys do it all the time
I know I left my clothes all over the place
And I took your twenty bucks
No I didn't get the front yard cut
'Cause I had to wash my truck
Will you bring me a cold one, baby
And turn on the tv
We'll talk about this later
There's a ball game I wanna see
Guys do it all the time
And you expect us to understand
When the shoe's on the other foot
You know that's when it hits the fan
Get over it, honey, life's a two way street
Or you won't be a man of mine
Sure I had some beers with the girls last night
Guys do it all the time
You look like you just took a long look in the mirror
Tell me baby if things don't look a whole lot clearer
Get over it, honey, life's a two way street
Or you won't be a man of mine
Sure I had some beers with the girls last night
Guys do it all the time
Yeah, guys do it
Yeah, guys do it
All the time, all the time
Yeah, guys do it
Yeah, guys do it
