Song Name: Here Tonight - The Acoustic Sessions
If ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight
Tonight
I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Oh oh
Let's just stay right here tonight
Oh oh
Oh oh
'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
