Song Name: Comeback Kid
Feels so strange, kicking around the town of my youth
I was never gonna stay, always hated in truth
The faces in the street, how they hid behind
Barroom smiles and the empty eyes
Since then I ain't found much to hold on to
Couple drink tickets, smoke-filled room
Doing the best with the circumstance
And telling myself that with
One more chance, I could do things better
But I just can't get my shit together long enough
To keep from running round like a ragged dog
They cast their doubts, I can still remember
Gonna shout them down, man it's now or never more to make
The same mistakes that I did back then
Playin' the part of the comeback kid
Rearrange the words on the page just one more time
Carving out a reason to fit the rhyme
Hoping they might show you the shape I'm in
Tired and torn but then again
Here I am in the crowd of the backstage door
Pushing my way for an open floor
When a shadowed hand called me to the side
Says he's got a little something that
I should try, to put my mind at ease
Just a little stem is all you need, to take the edge off boy
Now the walls around me they're starting to breathe
Dig in my heels and ready my aim
Bet my life on every last refrain, not sure if I
Could ever survive another hit
Too far gone for a comeback kid
My chest it pounds like a distant drum
Give into the heat that fills your lungs, and try to maintain
Though you're feeling so unsteady, so unsure
Reach down deep, can you feel the fire
To sing another song for the uninspired part of us all
That'll drag you down if you let it win
One more shot for the comeback kid
One more shot for the comeback kid
One more shot for the comeback kid
One more shot for the comeback kid
One more shot for the comeback kid
One more shot for the comeback kid
