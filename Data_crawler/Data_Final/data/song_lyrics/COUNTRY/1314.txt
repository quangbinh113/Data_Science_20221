Song Name: It Don't Work Like That
Long live the life of the party
Loud and foolhardy
Senior of the Freshman class
Always good for another round
Good for a mess around
Good for never lookin' back
What's the point in that?
He's lovin' where he's at
And he's at the homecoming tailgate
Anywhere they congregate
Sippin' on a real good time
It don't ever end
So if you want a piece of him
Better take your place in line
Best years, best friends
If he remembers them
Cause, when he puts on that face
Lightin' up every place
He's giving it all away
Holdin' nothin' back
Cold as a rolling stone
Don't wanna be alone
So He just keeps rolling on
So he won't crash
But it don't work like that
When he stumbles home
Yeah, he's still alone
With or without someone
The High King of Hearts
House made of cards
Only built for having fun
Playing the clown
Will bring the whole thing down
Cause when he puts on that face
Lightin' up every place
He's giving it all away
Holding nothin' back
Cold as a rolling stone
Don't wanna be alone
So he keeps rolling on
So he won't crash
But it don't work like that
Smoke from the ashes
Ghosts from the past
Can't haunt you if you let 'em go
They say time is a healer
Devil's a dealer
And better men can keep' em both
But that's a show
The one thing I know
Is, it don't work like that
