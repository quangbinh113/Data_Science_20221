Song Name: half of my hometown - ballerini album version
Half of my high school got too drunk
Half of my high school fell in love
With the girl next door
In their daddy's Ford
Half of my Main Street's mini skirts
Half of my Main Street's dressed for church
It could use some rain
And a fresh coat of paint
Half of my hometown's still hangin' around
Still talkin' about that one touchdown
They're still wearin' red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north, some went south
Still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
Half of our prom queens cut their hair
Half of them think that it ain't fair
The quarterback moved away and never came back
Oh, half of my family is happy I left
But my daddy knows that I won't forget
Where I came from
The same place where they came from
Half of my hometown's still hangin' around
Still talkin' about that one touchdown
They're still wearin' red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north, some went south
Still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
Half of my hometown
Back roads raise us
Highways take us
Memories make us wanna go back
To our hometown, settle down
Talk about that one touchdown
Raise some kids in red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown was in the crowd
They knew the words, they sang them loud
And all I wanna do is make them proud
'Cause half of me will always be
From Knoxville, Tennessee
My hometown
'Cause I'm half of my hometown
