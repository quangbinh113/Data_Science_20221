Song Name: Heartland
I should be married by now
Two kids in a paid-for house
I can hear 'em now
Askin' what I'm doin' now
I should have a little more to show
Than a suitcase smells like smoke
I should have an alibi
On where time goes when it flies
'Cause I been on the rocks
I been on the road
On the other side
Of every door closed
I've been on a limb
Tryin' to catch a break
Something's gotta give
Sometimes you gotta take
Take it down a fast lane
Right back to your last name
To remind you where you came from
You're still shinin' in the same sun
It don't matter how high
You've been floatin' in your blue sky
Nothin' gets you like goodbye can
When life is out of your hands
Yeah, you gotta let your heartland
I can roll the window down
Feel the wind in my hair now
Find a station through the static
The old me while I'm at it
'Cause I been on the rocks
I been on the road
Pullin' double shifts
Needle on low
Wakin' up alone
In the bed I made
Now would be a real good time to take
Take it down a fast lane
Right back to your last name
To remind you where you came from
You're still shinin' in the same sun
It don't matter how high
You've been floatin' in your blue sky
Nothin' gets you like goodbye can
When life is out of your hands
Yeah, you gotta let your heartland
Oh, you gotta let your heartland, yeah
You gotta let your heart land
In the middle of nowhere
Oh, you gotta let your heart land
Sometimes you just gotta go there, just go there
And it don't matter how high
You've been floatin' in your blue sky
Nothin' gets you like goodbye can
When life is out of your hands
Yeah, you gotta let your heartland
Oh, you gotta let your heartland, yeah, yeah
Yeah. You gotta let your heartland
Yeah. You gotta let your heartland
Oh
