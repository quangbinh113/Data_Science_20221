Song Name: Old Toy Trains - Single Version
Old toy trains, little toy tracks,
Little boy toys, coming from a sack,
Carried by a man dressed in white and red,
Little boy don't you think it's time you where in bed?
Close your eyeeeeees, listen to the skies,
All is calm, all is well,
Soon you'll hear Chris Cringle and the jingle bells
Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks, little boy toys
Coming form a sack,
Carried by a man dressed in white and red,
Little boy don't you think it's time you where in bed?
Close your eyeeeeees, listen to the skies,
All is calm, all is well,
Soon you'll hear Chris Cringle and the jingle bells
Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks, little boy toys
Coming form a sack,
Carried by a man dressed in white and red,
Little boy don't you think it's time you where in bed?
