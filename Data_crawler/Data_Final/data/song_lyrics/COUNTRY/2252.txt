Song Name: How Do I Get There
We've always been the best of friends
No secrets and no demands
But suddenly from somewhere out of the blue
I see a different light around you
One thing I haven't told you, I just wanna hold you
Never let go, I need to know
How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me?
Lost in your lovin' arms, it's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?
You probably think I lost my mind
Takin' this chance, crossin' that line
But I promise to be truer than true
Dreaming every night with these arms around you
I can't wait any longer, this feeling's gettin' stronger
Help me find a way
How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me?
Lost in your lovin' arms, it's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
But I'll climb any mountain that you want me to climb
The perfect combination is your heart and mine
Darlin', won't you give me a sign?
How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me?
Lost in your lovin' arms, that's where I wanna be
You know I love you
(How do I get there?)
How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me?
Lost in your lovin' arms, that's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there from here?
You know I love you
How do I get there from here?
You know I love you
