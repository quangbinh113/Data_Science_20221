Song Name: Check Yes Or No
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell
Next day I chased her around the playground
'Cross the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well, then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check "yes" or "no"
Now we're grown up, and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well, then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check "yes"or "no"
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well, then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check "yes" or "no"
Check "yes" or "no"
Check "yes" or "no"
Check "yes" or "no"
Check "yes" or "no"
