Song Name: Part Of It
My mama talked her daddy into letting me take her out our junior year
She was a hallway queen, outta my league and I smiled ear to ear
Every night she was in my truck, young love did what it does and
Daddy said, I know ya thought she was the one and it ain't not fun,
But, son, that's part of it
Sometimes you're gonna hurt like hell and have some scars from it
Leave ya with a story to tell
Ya live and learn and good ones go
You find out on down the road
When ya lay it all out and get down to the heart of it
Man, that's just life and that's all part of it
Grandaddy cut his teeth, planted that seed across 80 acres of land
He steady checked that gauge and
Prayed for rain like he knew the Big Man
All the way 'til the day that he met Him,
Daddy read his will to the family
I just about broke down when I found out he went
And left me part of it
Sometimes you're gonna hurt like hell and have some scars from it
Leave ya with a story to tell
Ya live and learn and good ones go
You find out on down the road
When ya lay it all out and get down to the heart of it
Man, that's just life and that's all part of it
That's all part of it
Heartbreaks faded and I chased a dream up to Tennessee
Met the love of my life, gave me two more and
I don't know who I'd be if they weren't part of it
Sometimes life takes care of itself and heals those scars from it
Leave ya with a story to tell
Ya live and learn and good ones go
You find out on down the road
When ya lay it all out and get down to the heart of it
Man, that's just life and that's just part of it
That's all part of it
It's all part of it
That's just part of it
