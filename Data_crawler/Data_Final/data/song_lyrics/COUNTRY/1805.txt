Song Name: Ramon Ayala
I'm on the road again
Half drunk with a lit cigarette
I don't know when
I'll be back in this town
At least that's what I tell her
Baby, I'm just sayin'
Maybe I just think too much
I'm leavin' in the a.m.
Baby, are you stayin'?
I know that you drank too much
And this is what she said to me
"I'm just your ordinary fuck up
There's nothin' special about me
I still bump Ramón Ayala when I get drunk
I'm just tellin' you, I'm not playin' you
I just wanna be the real me around you"
You, real me
Around you
I'm at the same damn place
She's starin' in my eyes, you know I'll give in
I'm wonderin'
If I should walk on over
I said, "Girl, I saw you winkin'
Tell me what you're thinkin'
Can I get your name?"
I'm not leavin' 'til the a.m.
Girl, where you stayin'?
Would you wanna stay with me?
And this is what I said to her
"I'm just your ordinary fuck up
There's nothin' special about me
I still bump Ramón Ayala when I get drunk
I'm just tellin' you, I'm not playin' you
I just wanna be the real me around..."
Mamacita, let's go cruisin'
Back to the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Girl, I forgot where we stayin'
It ain't funny, girl, I ain't playin'
Mamacita, 'tás bien linda
Mejor vamos pa'trás 'onde tú digas
Girl, let's go back to where you're stayin'
I hope that you don't fuckin' hate me
I'm just your ordinary fuck up
There's nothin' special about me
I still bump Selena when I get drunk
I'm just tellin' you, I'm not playin' you
I just wanna be the real me around you
You, the real me
The real me around you
You, oh, ooh
