Song Name: I Try to Think About Elvis
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot where I was
I try to think about Elvis, Memphis
Oprah in the afternoon
I try to think about palm trees, fig leaves
The Creature from the Black Lagoon
I try to think about high heels and good deals
Anything to get me through
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
I try to contemplate the cosmos
And what goes 'round and 'round the sky at night
I try to think about champagne, freight trains
Slowly rolling out of sight
I try to focus on the headlines, street crimes
Everytime I think I might
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
My mind wanders where it will
And when it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
My mind wanders where it will
And when it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
Come on Patty, get it together
I try to think about Shakespeare, leap year
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones
I try to think about hair-do's, tattoos
Sushi bars and saxophones
I try to think about the talk shows, new clothes
But I guess I should have known
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
You're all I think about these days
