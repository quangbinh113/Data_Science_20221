Song Name: More Than I Know
Well I know my way
'Round a six string flat top
Hand one over
I can play whatever song you wanna hear
Hand me a bottle
And I'll go full throttle 'til that sun comes up
And the stars hanging in the sky just disappear
But I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with
But it's be a Carlson live
When it comes to a girl like you
You gotta wait too much
Let loose and sometimes I can't believe my eyes
The way you move and the way you dance
I'm like sand running through your hands
I don't know how long I got, but I'm gonna take my chance
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with
Yeah, I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into
Said, I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with
