Song Name: Rescue Me
All i need, all I'm wanting
Is something sweet, to take all this pain that's been haunting me
Hold me down, don't let me get any higher
Turn me around, pull me away from this fire
Rescue me
Take my hand, help me stand
Rescue me
In your arms where i belong
Only vice, coke and whiskey
Walk the line, carry my suffering with me
Rescue me
Take my hand, help me stand
Rescue me
In your arms where i belong
Hеlp me come down with my feet on the ground again
I'vе been around and i need to repent for my sins
Yeah
Rescue me
Rescue me
Rescue me
