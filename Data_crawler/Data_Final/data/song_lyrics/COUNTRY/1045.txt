Song Name: Hello Darlin' - Single Version
Hello darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely
As you used to be
How's your new love
Are you happy
Hope your doin' fine
Just to know it
Means so much to me
What's that darlin'
How am I doin'
I'm doin' alright except I can't sleep
And I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time sake
Let me hold you
In my arms one more time
Thank you darlin'
May God bless you
And may each step you take
Bring you closer
To the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin'
Gotta go now
Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back Darlin'
I'll be waitin' for you...
