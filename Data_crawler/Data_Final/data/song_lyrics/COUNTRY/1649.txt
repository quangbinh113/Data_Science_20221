Song Name: Born Tough
Well my daddy always told me I was living in a man's world
But that don't mean there ain't room for a big-hearted girl
So my mama took me pickin' said that we could buy a set of tools
So that I could build my own life and play by my own rules
I was set in my ways, I had made up my mind
I was filing for divorce by the age of 29
Couldn't see the light at the end of the road
Had to stop to think of how the story goes
I was born tough, torn up
Hardened by time
I've been let down, all around
Discouraged by life
And it gets hard not to cry
So I have a thousand times
Well I was born tough
Well I can say for certain I was hell-bent on leaving town
So I hitched myself a trailer
Packed the things I couldn't live without
I was bound and determined to never go back there
Didn't matter to me then, could have been anywhere
Things are different now
It just don't feel the same
When they call me by my old name
I was born tough, torn up
Hardened by time
I've been let down, all around
Discouraged by life
And it gets hard not to cry
So I have a thousand times
And I can hold on for so long
And never let go
I can ride out, shoot the lights out
And close out the show
But when I say I've had enough
Darling don't you call my bluff
Cause I was born tough
I was born tough
Well I know it ain't easy
And no one ever said it should be
But that don't mean it ain't worth believing in someone or something
I was born tough, torn up
Hardened by time
I've been let down, all around
Discouraged by life
And it gets hard not to cry
So I have a thousand times
And I can hold on for so long
And never let go
I can ride out, shoot the lights out
And close out the show
But when I say I've had enough
Darling don't you call my bluff
Yeah when I say I've had enough
Darling don't you call my bluff
Cause I was born tough
I was born tough
I was born tough
I was born tough
And I've had enough
