Song Name: Do Me with Love
Words are cheap and I love you's are free
So unless you mean it, you don't spend them on me
Don't look twice if you're keeping score
'Cause heartaches are high priced and I've paid it before
Do me with love, don't do me wrong
You know my heart's been broken too long
And I've had one too many tears to fall
So do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all
I've taken some wrong roads and I've lost track
Of lovers who gave their hearts and then wanted 'em back
So I need someone who needs someone too
But spare me the memories if you're just passing through
Do me with love, don't do me wrong
You know my heart's been broken too long
And I've had one too many tears to fall
So do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all
Do me with love, don't do me wrong
You know my heart's been broken too long
And I've had one too many tears to fall
So do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all
Do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all
