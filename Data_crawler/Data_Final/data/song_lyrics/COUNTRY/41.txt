Song Name: You Didnâ€™t
I can never hate you
Even if I tried
Girl, I love you too much
And I've loved you too long, to find
Mm-mm
It ain't always a bad thing
Saying goodbye
And the last thing that I wanna be
Is a waste of your time
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I hope you find someone
To be the person for you
Mm-mm
That you were to me
What I wanted to be for you
I, I ain't ever asked you to settle or compromise
Girl, you deserve everything in this world
Even if it means you can't be mine
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't
Feel like I did
I gave you everything I had to give
You didn't need more
You just needed different
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't
