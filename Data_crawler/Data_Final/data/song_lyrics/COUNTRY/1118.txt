Song Name: Human
I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth
I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kind of careless with your heart
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasing all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy, all the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doing
I'm still learnin' to be human
So far I've been good at burning bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town
Bless your heart for never trying to fix me
Or quit me, or slow me down
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasing all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy, all the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doing
I'm still learnin' to be human
All the highways, playin' outlaw
Rollin' outta nowhere with the breaks off
All the crazy, and the whiskey
Wakin' up and wonderin' what hit me
Whoa, forgive me, I really don't know what I'm doing
'Cause I'm still learning to be human
Still learning to be human
