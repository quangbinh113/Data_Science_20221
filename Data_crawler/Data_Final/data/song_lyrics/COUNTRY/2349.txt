Song Name: Ain't Life Grand
Watchin people roll by
Wonderin where they're goin
Hey, what's your job
What are you knowin
Drivin to the grocery store
Pull my money out
Passin by the liquor store
Throw my money down
Ain't life grand

Ain't life grand

My wife's got the blues
Now I've got them
Gonna bring her a kiss
Make those blues run
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grand
Sun came out the other day

Through those dusty clouds
And in my mind I was a child

And it felt good!
Ain't life grand (x4)
