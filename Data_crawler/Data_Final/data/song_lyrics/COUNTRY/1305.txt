Song Name: Between You & Me
Can I tell you a secret?
I might have to slide in close for you to hear it
Over that bartender yelling out them drinks
While the cover band off-key sings, yeah
Can I tell you a secret?
Between you and me
All I can think about
Is leaving here early to get you alone
Pullin' you into me
Not even music on
Nothin' but you, my t, white sheets
Between you and me
Between you and me, yeah
Girl, you know me like no one
It's like you get done up to get me undone
Killin' me in that dress all night and it's only eight
And I'm down to close down this place, yeah
But I'd rather close up this space
Between you and me
All I can think about
Is leaving here early to get you alone
Pullin' you into me
Not even music on
Nothin' but you, my t, white sheets
Between you and me
Between you and me, yeah
Between you and me
(A whole lot of loving)
Between you and me, yeah
(So let's leave nothing)
Between you and me
All I can think about
Is leaving here early to get you alone
Pullin' you into me
Not even music on
Nothin' but you, my t, white sheets
Between you and me
Between you and me, yeah
