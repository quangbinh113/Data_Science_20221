Song Name: Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away
We've been up all night long
Trying to solve a problem, well, it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleeping if our love is wearing thin
'Cause I ain't giving up, you ain't giving in.
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.
And real love walks, a real thin line
No communication will kill it every time
So open up your heart, baby we can work it out
'Cause we got the kind of love people dream about.
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.
It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on, yeah
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away...
