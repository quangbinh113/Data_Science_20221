Song Name: Runnin' Outta Moonlight
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up your pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my head lights, that's my truck
Come on baby don't you keep me waiting
I gotta go I got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms
Whoa. Girl Every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa,this is one that we don't wanna miss, no
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now were knockin' on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin' outta moonlight
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pullin' into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear
Whoa, girl you never look better then you do right now
Whoa, oh heaven let your light shine down
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now were knockin' on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa, girl Every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Hey baby don't it feel so right
Come on now were runnin' outta moonlight
All I wanna do is hold you tight
Come on, come on, come on were runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa. Ya were runnin' outta moonlight. Whoa
