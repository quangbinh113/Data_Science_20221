Song Name: Just A Kiss
Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelin's when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holdin' you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burnin' so bright
No, i don't want to mess this thing up
No, i don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waitin' for my whole life
So, baby I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real
No, it's never felt so right
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burnin' so bright
No, i don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waitin' for my whole life
So, baby I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight
No, i don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams tonight
Tonight, tonight
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burnin' so bright
No, i don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waitin' for my whole life
So, baby I'm alright
Oh-oh, let's do this right with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight
