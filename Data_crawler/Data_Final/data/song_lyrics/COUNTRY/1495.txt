Song Name: Hold My Beer
Well, we were down in Austin, Texas
At the Hang 'em High Saloon
Hitting the bars, pickin' on guitars
And singin' out country tunes
When some third-string Longhorn quarterback
Said he wanted a piece of Wade
Well, when it's two for one
It's one for all
So I jumped down off that stage
Hold my beer
This won't take long
Step back, son
Let me show you
Just how it's done
Well, I'm bulletproof
Ten feet tall when I'm drinkin'
Get to thinkin' that I'm Superman
So you stay here
And hold my beer
Yeah, this one time, we were out in L.A.
Shuttin' down the Sunset Strip
We were sippin' on bubbles
Lookin' for some trouble
When a supermodel strutted on in
Yeah, Randy told me, "That girl is famous"
She's way, way over your head
I bet you five hundred
You can't get her number
So I just smiled and said:
Hold my beer
This won't take long
Step back, son
Let me show you
Just how it's done
Well, I'm a Prince Charmin', Casanova
Don Juan, Romeo
A smooth talkin' ladies' man
You stay here
And hold my beer
Well, good friends and bad decisions
Just go hand in hand
And it's good to know you got somebody
Who's got your back
And got your can
Here, hold this man, you know what I'm talkin' about
Oh, man!
Yeah, well hold my beer
This won't take long
Step back, son
And let us show you
Just how it's done
So don't be fakin'
It's okay to be drinkin'
And I'm gonna want it back again
You stay here
And hold my beer
No, no, man
You stay here
Yeah, and hold my beer
I got you, little buddy
Good luck with that
