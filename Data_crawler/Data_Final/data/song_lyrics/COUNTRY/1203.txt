Song Name: It's Hard to Be Humble
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can
I used to have a girlfriend
But I guess she just couldn't compete
With all of these love-starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet
Well I could probably find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares? I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're doing the best that you can
I guess you could say I'm a loner
A cowboy outlaw, tough and proud
Well, I could have lotsa friends if I wanted,
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell, I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're doing the best that you can
We're doing the best that we can!
Give yourselves a hand.
Yeeee-haw!
