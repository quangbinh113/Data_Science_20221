Song Name: I'm No Angel
No I'm no angel
No I'm no stranger to the streets
I've got my label
So I won't crumble at your feet
And I know baby
Though I've got scars upon my cheek
And I'm half crazy
Come on and love me baby
So you find me hard to handle well
I'm easier to hold
So you like my spurs that jingle
And I never leave you cold
So I might steal your diamonds
I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel ooh

No I'm no angel
No I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle
Let me start a fire with your spark
Oh come on baby
Come and let me show you my tattoo
Let me drive you crazy
Come on and love me baby
So you don't care a darn about me
I'll never treat you bad
I won't ever lift a hand to hurt you
And I'll always leave you glad
So I might steal your diamonds
I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel
No I'm no angel
No I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle
Let me start a fire in your heart
Oh come on baby
Come and let me show you my tattoo
Let me drive you crazy
Come on and love me baby
Well come on baby
Drive me crazy babe
Drive me crazy
Come on baby
Oh come on baby
Oh come on baby
