Song Name: Loose Change
I remember the night when I caught your eye
Nothin' but good fortune, nothin' but good times
Seems lately the love has lost its shine
Used to make me feel like a million bucks
And now you got me feelin' like
Loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
'Stead of rollin' round in your pocket
Like loose change
Right now I could be finally settin' sail
See the seven wonders, wonderin' why the hell
I keep on settin' myself up to fail
Stuck inside this game with you
Tippin' heads or tails
Loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
'Stead of rollin' round in your pocket
Like loose change
Well, love is not supposed to be played like Monopoly
Be careful where you're tossin' me
'Cause I'll be rollin' away
Like loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
'Stead of rollin' round in your pocket
Like loose change
I'm fallin' out of your pocket'
Like loose change
