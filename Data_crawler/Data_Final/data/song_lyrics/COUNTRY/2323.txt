Song Name: Can't Keep Running
Don't ask me where I'm going,
I don't know,
Which way the wind is blowing,
I don't know,
We've been over this again and again,
Talking 'bout it only drives me insane,
Think I'd rather take a walk in the rain
I know, I can't keep running,
I know, you've laken enough,
I know, I can't keep running,
And I know you don't want someone,
Running in and out of your life
This ain't no game we're playing
I need time
Listen to what I'm saying,
I need time
Guess I saw it coming right from the start
I can't bring myself to break her heart
When I do it's gonna tear me apart
I know, I can't keep running
I know, you've laken enough
I know, I can't keep running,
And I know you don't want someone,
Running in and out of your life
Can't escape it,
I gotta face it,
Don't wanna leave you with your heart on the line
I can't refuse you,
Don't wanna lose you,
Can't you see that I'm running out of time
I know, I can't keep running
I know, you've taken enough
I know, I can't keep running,
And I know you don't want sorneone
Running in and out of your life
I know, I can't keep running
I know, you've taken enough
I know, I can't keep running,
And I know you don't want sorneone
Running in and out of your life
