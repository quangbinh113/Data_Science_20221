Song Name: Ain't My Day
Left 30 early, I still showed up late
Boss wasn't buyin' what I had to say
Took it on the chin with a smile on my face
No, it ain't my day
Clock it out, hop in my '05 truck
Just paid it off, and now it won't start up
Slam the steerin' wheel, swear I 'bout had enough
No, it ain't my day
And, there's always tomorrow, just ain't workin' today
Still got a little drink in the bottle, and it's callin' my name
Yeah, I know that I'll be hurtin' in the mornin' light
But it ain't my day, so I'm drinkin' tonight, yeah (c'mon)
Yeah, we're drinkin' tonight (yeah, we're drinkin' tonight)
Had a fight, late last night
And I knew she wasn't comin' back
Steal my cash, smoke my stash
And she took every last beer I had, yeah
But my second home, just down the road's got a neon light (hell, yeah)
It ain't my day, so I'm drinkin' tonight (here we go)
We're drinkin' tonight
Yeah, we're drinkin' tonight
Drinkin' tonight (yeah, we are)
And there's always tomorrow just ain't workin' today
Still got a little drink in the bottle, and it's callin' my name
Yeah, I know that I'll be hurtin' in the mornin' light (oh, that's right)
And it ain't my day, so we're drinkin' tonight
Yeah, I know that I'll be hurtin' in the mornin' light
But it ain't my day, so we're drinkin' tonight (oh, yeah)
I said we're drinkin' tonight
Oh yeah, we're drinkin' tonight
Yeah, drinkin' tonight
Yeah, it ain't my day (ain't my day)
So I'm drinkin' tonight
Said, it ain't my day (ain't my day)
So I'm drinkin' tonight
No, it ain't our day (ain't our day)
So we're drinkin' tonight
Ah, it ain't our day
So we're drinkin' tonight
