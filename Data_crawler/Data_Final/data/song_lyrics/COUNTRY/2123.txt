Song Name: 'Til I See You Again
Yeah, there's somethin' about me and you
And when we end up in the same room
It's automatic, it's a ride
It starts with "I miss you" and ends with "goodbye"
I'll hurt you, you'll hurt me
It's always just a matter of time
And I'll be back on my feet and movin' on
Feelin' pretty good about bein' alone
Dancin' and singin' my freedom song
Stronger than ever, I'll be
Bartender, fill my empty glass
Things are lookin' up, not lookin' back
Laughin' so much nobody asks
If we're still together
Now I'm in such a better place
Never was real love anyway
Yeah, we were meant to be friends
Till I see you again
Till I see you again
Yeah, you'd think that it'd get old
Just runnin' down the same dead-end road
But I love how you get me there
Boy, we always crash and burn
And I always end up where
I'm back on my feet and movin' on
Feelin' pretty good about bein' alone
Dancin' and singin' my freedom song
Stronger than ever I'll be
Bartender, fill up my empty glass
Things are lookin' up, not lookin' back
Laughin' so much nobody asks
If we're still together
Now I'm in such a better place
Never was real love anyway
Yeah, we were meant to be friends
Till I see you again, Mm
Till I see you again
I'll hurt you, you'll hurt me
It's always just a matter of time
And I'll be back on my feet and movin' on
Feelin' pretty good about bein' alone
Dancin' and singin' my freedom song
Stronger than ever I'll be
Bartender, fill my empty glass"
Things are lookin' up, not lookin' back
Laughin' so much nobody asks
If we're still together
Now I'm in such a better place
Never was real love anyway
Yeah, we were meant to be friends
Till I see you again
Till I see you again (Till I see you again)
Till I see you, Till I see you again
Mm, Till I see you (Till I see you)
Till I see you (Till I see you)
Till I see you again (Till I see you, Till I see you)
