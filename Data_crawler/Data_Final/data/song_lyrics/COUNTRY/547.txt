Song Name: Be My Baby Tonight
I know you've heard that worn out line
About love at first sight
Well I never knew those words were true
'Til you walked in tonight
All it took was just one look
To knock me off my feet
I'm not a man of many words
So I'll make this short and sweet
Could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Yeah I'd take a chance slow dance make a little romance
Honey it'll be alright
Girl you got me wishin' we were huggin'
And a kissin' and a holdin' each other tight
So could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
I'm not tryin to come on like
Some rhinestone romeo
I'm a lookin' for a whole lot more
Than a one night rodeo
What can I do to prove to you
I'm a layin' it on the line
I'll even get down on my knees
Just to beg you one more time
Girl could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Yeah I'd take a chance slow dance make a little romance
Honey it'll be alright
Girl you got me wishin we were huggin
And a kissin and a holdin each other tight
So could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Girl could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Yeah I'd take a chance slow dance make a little romance
Honey it'll be alright
Girl you got me wishin' we were huggin'
And a kissin' and a holdin' each other tight
So could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
