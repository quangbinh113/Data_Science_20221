Song Name: Built Different
I like country songs and fast cars
13 bars and 50 stars on my flag, flying on my land
If you want to come and take it, I'll make my stand
I like Jack and Coke with a cold beer
Top water fishing and white tail deer
I like jacked up trucks and rodeos
Dropped tailgates and long dirt roads
I'm just built different
I roll my own way
Never give a damn about what people say
I like talking shit
I drink too much
I'm on the gas while you're on the clutch
And I'm cold as ice
If it's on, let's get it
Some of us are just built different
Where the east ends and the west begins
I'm a ride or die cowboy, ask my friends
I ain't scared, so watch your mouth
Redneck white trash son of the South
I'm just built different
I roll my own way
Never give a damn about what people say
I like talking shit
I drink too much
I'm on the gas while you're on the clutch
And I'm cold as ice
If it's on, let's get it
Some of us are just built different
I'm just built different
I roll my own way
Never give a damn about what people say
I like talking shit
I drink too much
I'm on the gas while you're on the clutch
And I'm cold as ice
And I'm cold as ice
I'm just built different
I roll my own way
Never give a damn about what people say
I like talking shit
I drink too much
I'm on the gas while you're on the clutch
And I'm cold as ice
If it's on, let's get it
Some of us are just built different
