Song Name: Broke Ass Kid
Rolled out of bed from a headache
And for the pills and some coffee to wash it away
And I saw that shit was all gone
But she left a few words on a text there on my phone that said
All I am is all I'll be
Just a broke-ass kid beatin' on his guitar
Lost and lonely
So damn lonely
People couldn't believe
I let her go
But there's so much more to that story
Nobody else knows
Oh, the shit that they don't know 'cause
All I am is all I'll be
Just a broke-ass kid beatin' on his guitar
Lost and lonely
So damn lonely
Hell, I'm doin' fine
Can't please the whole town, won't even try
And I ain't losin' no sleep
Already know what these assholes think of me and they said
All I am is all I'll be
Just a broke-ass kid beatin' on his guitar
Lost and lonely
So damn lonely
All I am is all I'll be
Just a broke-ass kid beatin' on his guitar
Lost and lonely
So damn lonely
So damn lonely
So goddamn lonely
Yeah, I'm just a broke-ass
Yeah, I'm just a broke-ass
Here I am, this is all I'll be
Just a broke-ass kid beatin' on his guitar
Lost and lonely
