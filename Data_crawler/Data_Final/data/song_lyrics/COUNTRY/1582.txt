Song Name: Starved
If I had a chance, babe
To go back in time, maybe I'd try a time or two
This life took you in, babe
The same life that reminds me I could never love me like you do
The road is so hard, dear
I bet there's some hometown bar that we could be
But I just had a dream, dear
It's you in the late fall, all warm, swarmed by the midday light
We're layin' on the roof of my car
Feelin' young, feelin' numb, feelin' starved
Of all the things that a moment can be
This one's best kept a memory
The purest parts of my heart are you and me
I love when your grin grows
The corners of your lips liftin', lift me when I'm low
I read in the good book
The best things in life are free and need to be let go
So take one last good look
Let's share one last cigarette
I'll be gone by the time you're ashin' it
Stop askin' things you know the answers to
There ain't no world in which I am good for you
And we're layin' on the roof of my car
Feelin' young, feelin' numb, feelin' starved
Of all the things a moment can be
This one's best kept a memory
How the kindest parts of my mind are you and me
