Song Name: My Heart Skips A Beat
Oh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes, you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
