Song Name: You Didnâ€™t - Acoustic
I could never hate you even if I tried
Girl, I love you too much, and I've loved you too long to fight
Mmm
It ain't always a bad thing saying goodbye
And the last thing that I wanna be is a waste of your time
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I hope you find someone
To be the person for you
Mmm
That you were to me, what I wanted to be for you
I, I ain't ever asked you to settle or compromise, mm
Girl, you deserve everything in this world
Even if it means you can't be mine
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't
Feel like I did
I gave you everything I had to give
You didn't need more
You just needed different
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up its mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't
