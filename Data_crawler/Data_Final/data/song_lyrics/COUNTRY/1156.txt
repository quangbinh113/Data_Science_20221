Song Name: Out In The Middle
There's an old rural route two-lane
Take it out past where the radio just can't
Past the river bridge with a rope swing
And a mailbox painted all John Deere green
The end of a bunch of gravel driveway
Out here doing our own thing
Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little
Out in the middle
Come Friday, we come undone
Stay half-lit like the high life neon
Barely hanging on like sheds in the pole barn
You can hear Hank clear 'cross the next farm
City folk say we're crazy
But they ain't never been way
Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little
Out in the middle of nowhere, that's where I wanna be
In the old oak shade by the family graves
With the southern ground on me
Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little
Out in the middle
