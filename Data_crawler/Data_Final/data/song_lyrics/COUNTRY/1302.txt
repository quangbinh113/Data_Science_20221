Song Name: Another - Wedding Version
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Put another record on
Pour another glass of wine
Rock another night of us
Losing all track of time
Everything you do just makes me want some more of you
Every smile, every kiss, every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna want another
Never ever gonna wanna
Another smile, sleepy eyes
Waking up right next to me
A million more just like last night
You and me on repeat
Every smile, every kiss, every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna want another, oh no
Never ever gonna want another
Oh no, no (oh no, no, no)
Everything you do just makes me want some more of you
Yeah baby, ain't another who could ever love me like you do
Every smile, every kiss, every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that (look you give me like that)
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna want another, oh yeah
I'll always want another dance, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
