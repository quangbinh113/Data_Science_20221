Song Name: Ain't a Train
Living on wings and wheels
In my mind we're made of steel
But you ain't running scared enough
And you ain't running fast enough for me
Behind the eight-ball ain't always a bad place to be
You can get out of anything with a dollar and a dream
When your back's against the wall you're
Fixed but they can't get you from your six you know
Maybe holding on go something hurts you more than letting go
If it ain't hurting maybe it ain't working and it ain't worth it, no
Maybe the rain that brings the thunder
Helped put out the flames
And maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train
Maybe holding on go something hurts you more than letting go
If it ain't hurting maybe it ain't working and it ain't worth it, no
Maybe the rain that brings the thunder
Helped put out the flames
And maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train
Maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train
