Song Name: Hit the Nail on the Head - Remastered
I saw you last night
Sittin' alone at the bar
Came back this evenin'
Just to find out who you are
Cause baby, baby
You hit the nail right on the head
I can tell you're from down south
The way you say ya'll
You look at me over your shoulder
Just like Lauren Bacall
Oh baby, (baby, baby)
You hit the nail right on the head
Well I like the way you chuckle at me
I just love the way you hold your gown
It's pretty good matter
To just stagger over here
We'll couldn't we find a place where
There's not so many people around
Come over here, baby
Let's dance and I can sing
Wrap yourself around me
Just like a... a yoyo string
Oh baby baby... mmm... baby baby
Come on over, baby
Come on up to my place
I got something up there, darlin'
Wipe that smile right off your face
(Oh baby baby... mmm... baby baby)
You hit the nail right on the head
Oh ummm
Curls in your hair
Cut me like a knife
Sometime later on, baby
You're gonna hafta tell me
The story of your life
(Oh baby baby... mmm... baby baby)
You hit the nail right on the head
Oh baby
(Oh baby baby... mmm... baby baby)
You hit the nail right on the head
Oh hey baby... yeah!
