Song Name: Long Haired Country Boy (feat. The Rockin' CJB)
People say I ain't no good
And I'm crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the mornin'
And I get drunk in the afternoon
I'm kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made
And I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Well, I've seen a preacher man talkin' on TV
Was puttin' down rock 'n' roll
He wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said, Jesus walked on water
And y'all know this is true
Well sometimes I think that old preacher man
Should like do a little walkin' too
'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
Yeah, if I can't get it on my own
Yeah, if you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Oh, here it goes
Well, I said the poor girl wants to marry
And the rich girl wants to flirt
The rich boys ran off to college
And all of us poor boys came to work
The drunker wants another drink of wine
And the politician wants your vote
And me, I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke
'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
Yeah, if I can't get it on my own
Yeah, if you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Well I said, I said
If you don't like how I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Get 'em boys
