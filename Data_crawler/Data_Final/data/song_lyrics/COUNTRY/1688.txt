Song Name: Can't Do This No More
Well I
Kept the notes I wrote for me
And I
Read between the lines to see
That your intentions were
To bring out the worst in me
And I
Redefine what you call love
Is it just a deadly drug?
Is what we had true?
Or was it a waste of time?
And you
Came to me with evil eyes
I've been
Beaten down several times
So I fell for you and all of your
God damn lies
'Cause I
Can't do this no more
Can't love you no more
One sunrise away
From my downfall
And
Take my cents and dimes
Take all that you find
Soon realize
That you burned it all
Well you
Paint the picture far too well
Hide behind the lies you tell
How could I have not
Known before that
An angel's smile
Leaves a hell of a burn
Your bedside bible pages don't turn
Your flawless reputation
Can't be restored
'Cause I
Can't do this no more
Can't love you no more
One sunrise away
From my downfall
And
Take my cents and dimes
Take all that you find
Soon realize
That you burned it all
Oh, you burned it all
You burned it all
You burned it all
Well I
Kept the notes I wrote for me
And I
Read between the lines to see
That your intentions were
To bring out the worst in me
Now I
I can't do this no more
I can't love you no more
One sunrise away
From my downfall
And
Take my cents and dimes
Take all that you find
You soon realize
That you burned it all
