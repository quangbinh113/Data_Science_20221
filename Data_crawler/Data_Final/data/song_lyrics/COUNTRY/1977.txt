Song Name: Knock Yourself Out
Quit wasting all my damn time
You got one toe in, lemme teach you how to swim
Keep your nickels, baby I'm a dime
With thick hips, pink lips, like salt around the rim
Honestly, this is overdue
I'm making your mind up for you
If you are gonna do you, then do you (c'mon!)
Knock yourself out
If you wanna fall from heaven, just to go land yourself a seven
Yeah, knock yourself out
Go take a look around
I don't got no doubts
You're gonna be in for lonely weather
So I packed up your favorite sweater, 'cause it's cold out
You sure found a sure way to let yourself down
So go ahead knock, knock, knock yourself out
(C'mon Renee)
Oh, Uh-uh-uh, yeah (c'mon)
I don't mean to pump my own tires, but I'm the truth, times two
A girl you're gonna hate to lose
Look behind ya, there's a long line, of good men, no boys
Yeah, I'm canceling the noise
Honestly, this is overdue
I'm making your mind up for you
If you're gonna do you, then do you (c'mon)
Knock yourself out
If you wanna fall from heaven, just to go land yourself a seven (land yourself a seven, yeah)
Yeah, knock yourself out (knock yourself out)
Go take a look around (take a look around)
I don't got no doubts (no doubts)
You're gonna be in for lonely weather
So I packed up your favorite sweater, 'cause it's cold out
You sure found a sure way to let yourself down (ay)
So go ahead knock, knock, knock yourself out (hey-ey)
Look, all loyalty ever got me was getting sloppy
Waking up crying tears in my Irish coffee
If disrespect was a weapon, then I think you shot me
And yeah you having fun with Brandi, but this bitch is not me
Baby, I'm grown, I'm well-equipped to hold my own
And I'll be so quick to block your number when I see it on my phone
They say that life's a joke, that's why I'm laughing at you now
You better stop the circus act, nobody wanna fuck a clown, lil' bitch
Who do you think you, who do you think you
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you, who do you think you
Who do you think you are? (Who do you think you are!)
Knock yourself out (knock yourself, out!)
If you wanna fall from heaven, just to go land yourself a seven (land yourself a seven)
Yeah, knock yourself out (uh-huh)
Go take a look around (go take a look around) (yeah)
I don't got no doubts (no doubts)
You're gonna be in for lonely weather
So I packed up your favorite sweater, 'cause it's cold out
You sure found a sure way to let yourself down (let yourself down)
So go ahead knock, knock, knock yourself out
Hey, ha
Knock, knock, knock yourself out
