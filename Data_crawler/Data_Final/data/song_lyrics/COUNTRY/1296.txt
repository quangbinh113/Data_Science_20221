Song Name: Take My Name - Wedding Version
Take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waiting, taking my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
I hope you don't think it's a little bit crazy
Saying this all so soon
But baby, it's the right time, knew it from the first time
That I laid eyes on you
It's okay, let 'em say what they want
They might think I should wait, but I don't
No, I don't wanna waste a minute
Girl, I want you in every single part of my world
So take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waiting, taking my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
I know I'm the last guy anybody think might
Ever be talking like this, yeah
But I can see my future in your eyes tonight
And taste forever on your lips
I'm like, "Hold up a minute, don't go
Ain't no way I can take this slow, so
Go ahead and tell me I'm outta my mind
Or baby, just tell me yes"
And take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waiting, taking my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
Take my days, baby, take my nights
Go and take the rest of my life
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna wait no more
Take my name and make it yours, yeah
Take it all
Baby, I don't ever want it back
Take it all
Yeah, everything that I have
Take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waiting, taking my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
Take my days, baby, take my nights
Go and take the rest of my life
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna wait no more
Take my name and make it yours
Make it yours
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna wait no more
Take my name and make it yours
