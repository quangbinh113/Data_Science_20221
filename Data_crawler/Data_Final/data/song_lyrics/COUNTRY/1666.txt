Song Name: Better Off
You tore out of that driveway pedal to the floorboard
Told me you were done wasn't putting up with no more
Bags were all packed by the time I got home
You were long gone
Now I'm sitting with my boots up, hat back, tab cracked
Half lit ready to go (ready to go)
I'm better off sippin' on a ice cold can
Doin' 12 ounce curls, Blue Mountains in my hand
If it's a long neck, buddy I want it
30 rack gone like them Goodyear Tires
I'm better off sittin' in the same dive bar
Drinkin' all damn night, soakin' this broke heart
So cheers to your taillights in the rearview mirror
I'm better off with a beer
(I'm better off with a beer)
I'm minding my own in a corner booth seeing you
Walking right in with a new dude, yeah
Yeah, I'm thinkin' that it's funny that you're thinkin' that I care
'Cause these empties on this tables say I'm better right here
I'm better off sippin' on a ice cold can
Doin' 12 ounce curls, Blue Mountains in my hand
If it's a long neck, buddy I want it
30 rack gone like them Goodyear Tires
I'm better off sittin' in the same dive bar
Drinkin' all damn night, soakin' this broke heart
So cheers to your taillights in the rearview mirror
I'm better off with a beer
I'm better off with a beer
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer
Gonna twist them tops, gonna drink 'em all
'Til there's no bottles of beer on the wall
I'm better off sippin' on a ice cold can
Doin' 12 ounce curls, Blue Mountains in my hand
If it's a long neck, buddy I want it
30 rack gone like them Goodyear Tires
I'm better off sittin' in the same dive bar
Drinkin' all damn night, soakin' this broke heart
So cheers to your taillights in the rearview mirror
I'm better off with a beer
(I'm better off with a beer)
I'm better off with a beer
I'm better off with a beer
I'm better off with a beer
