Song Name: Black Magic Lady
I feel myself falling
Countless days turned to nights
And I can still feel you here
In every corner of my mind
All you left me was your goodbye note
I never dreamed I'd be alone when I woke up
From this nightmare
That you've got me in
Black magic lady
Push your needles right on through
No one can save me now
Skin is burning like a fuse
And it hurts so bad because
You'll just keep lying
Casting spells like you do
You'd sew up my lips and eyes
If it would keep me from the truth
All you left me was your goodbye note
I never dreamed I'd be alone when I woke up
From this nightmare
That you've got me in
Black magic lady
Push your needles right on through
No one can save me now
Skin is burning like a fuse
And I'm about to go off on you
I'm about to go off on you
I'm about to go off on you
Black magic lady
Push your needles right on through
No one can save me now
My skin is burning like a fuse
Black magic lady
Push your needles right on through
No one can save me now, no
Skin is burning like a fuse, oh
