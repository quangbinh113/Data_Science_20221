Song Name: USA
USA (USA) let's ride
I don't know about you
But I know about us
And we got 1776 reasons to party
Yeah, we just got paid
Yeah, we're saddling up
And we got the subs up loud and we 'bout to get it started
'Cause we the people of the constitution
Bumping Alan Jackson on the Chattahoochee
We're back roads raised and Jesus saved
So let me hear you say hallelujah
So let me get me turned up
Let your redneck loose
Crank ya country up
To the red, white, and blue
Yeah, if you love Levi jeans and freedom fried chicken
Jacked up trucks and honky tonk women
Raise ya drink to the home of the brave
Ain't nobody party like the USA
(USA, USA, USA)
Ain't nobody party like the USA
We're American made
From head to toe
Yeah, we sip moonshine like it's a coors lite out of the bottle
Yeah, we'll wait for grain and make the beer ice-cold
If you like rockey top, roll tide, rock 'n' roll up high
Y'all better let me know
Let me get me turned up
Let your redneck loose
Crank ya country up
To the red, white, and blue
Yeah, if you love Levi jeans and freedom fried chicken
Jacked up trucks and honky tonk women
Raise ya drink to the home of the brave
Ain't nobody party like the USA
(USA, USA, USA) ooh, ain't nobody

Ain't nobody party like the USA
USA
Here's a little story that I got to tell
About the USA that you know so well
From the east to the west
From the north to the south
Everybody put your flags out (put 'em up)
From the red to the white
From the white to the blue
We fight for the freedom, but that you knew
Freedom ain't free but freedom is priceless
There's no country like this
Now say it
USA, USA
Little louder y'all
USA
One more time
USA
Let me get me turned up
Let your redneck loose
Crank ya country up
To the red, white, and blue
Yeah, if you love Levi jeans and freedom fried chicken
Jacked up trucks and honky tonk women
Raise ya drink to the home of the brave
Ain't nobody party like the USA
(USA, USA, USA) little louder now
Ain't nobody party like the USA
(USA, USA, USA) ooh, ain't nobody, oh
Ain't nobody party like the USA
