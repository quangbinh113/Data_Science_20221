Song Name: Half Of Me
I'm supposed to mow the grass today
I'm supposed to fix the fence
But with the sun beatin' down on me
It's hard to make it make sense
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold heart truth
And with a 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
Yeah, I kinda need to wash my truck
But hell, I kinda don't care
I think old Alan Jackson said it best
"It's five o'clock somewhere"
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold heart truth
And with a 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, and the other half does too
Yeah, yeah
Half of me wants a cold beer
If I did what I should be doin'
Buddy, that would really ruin all the fun, yeah
There's a world of bad decisions out there, but this ain't one
'Cause half of me wants a cold, cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold heart truth (yeah, it is)
And with a 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
Yeah, half of me wants a cold, cold beer
The other half wants two
Woo-hoo!
That sounds good, but I can't tell 'cause you're in or not
