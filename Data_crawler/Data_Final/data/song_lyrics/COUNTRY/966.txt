Song Name: The Time I've Wasted
I could have walked around the world a couple times
I could have swam across the ocean and back again
Made a wish on every star that Galileo drew
For all the time I've wasted on you
I could have downed a million beers in Mexico
Counted every piece of gravel on a long country road
Sailed that slow boat to China right up to the moon
For all the time I've wasted on you
Time goes by, and when it's gone
It's gone, and you realize
Time just lies, and you did not move on
No, you just cried, you just cried
I could have filled the Mississippi river with my tears
No telling what I could have done with all these years
I could have dug out the Grand Canyon with a spoon
For all the time I've wasted on you
Time goes by, and when it's gone
It's gone, and you realize
Time just lies, and you did not move on
No, you just cried, you just cried, hmm
For everything I've lost I'm not mad at love
I'd even give it one more day if I thought, it would be enough
I could have served five life sentences for a crime I didn't do
For all the time I've wasted on you
For all the time I've wasted on you
