Song Name: All My Friends Say
I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club?
Ain't got a clue what went down
So. I started calling around
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles when you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy seeing you with him
You know, I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some Cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you, comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I found my billfold, I cried, oh, no, no
Good time Charlie got me, now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl, I must have really showed you
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles when you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy seeing you with him
You know, I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some Cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you, comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd, pouring out my heart
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles when you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy seeing you with him
You know, I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some Cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you, comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my, all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what all my friends say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what all my friends say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Charlie, charlie we need some shots right upfront here
There in the back, everybody c'mon
Charlie, charlie
