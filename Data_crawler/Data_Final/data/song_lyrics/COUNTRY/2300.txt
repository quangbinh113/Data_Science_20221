Song Name: Heard It in a Love Song
I ain't never been with a woman long enough
For my boots to get old
We've been together so long now
They both need resoled
If I ever settle down
You'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me
To head on down the line
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
I'm the kind of man who likes to get away
Like to start dreaming about tomorrow, today
Never said that I love you, even though it's so
Where's that duffle bag of mine, it's time to go
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
I'm gonna be leaving at the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman tagging along
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder
And I guess I always will
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
