Song Name: Heaven's Jukebox
Well, I don't know what happens when we go
But I hear that the streets are paved in gold
And maybe there's a little red dirt for my soul
And maybe, just maybe the beer's still cold
If Heaven's got a jukebox
I hope it's filled up with country songs
I hope it's got a dance floor
So we can two-step to 'em all night long
I'll keep 'em rollin' and rockin'
So them good times ain't stopping for all of eternity
If Heaven's got a jukebox
Lord knows that's where I'll be
Well, I wonder if that light at the end is neon
And I sure hope that there's a barstool for me to be on
Give me Hank, give me Cash, give me Merle, give me Jones
I know where I'm going when I'm home
If Heaven's got a jukebox
I hope it's filled up with country songs
I hope it's got a dance floor
So we can two-step to 'em all night long
I'll keep 'em rollin' and rockin'
So them good times ain't stopping for all of eternity
If Heaven's got a jukebox
Lord knows that's where I'll be
If Heaven's got a jukebox
I hope it's filled up with country songs
I hope it's got a dance floor
So we can two-step to 'em all night long
I'll keep 'em rollin' and rockin'
So them good times ain't stopping for all of eternity
If Heaven's got a jukebox
If Heaven's got a jukebox
That's where I'll be
