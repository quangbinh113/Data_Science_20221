Song Name: Now We're Talkin'
Made it to friday
From a long week
The bar was dead so
I was gonna leave
Just paid my tab
Then you walk in
Shot me a smile
We're talkin
Tell me where ya from
Tell me what ya drinking
Tell me who you are
What you like What you thinkin
Tell me with your lips while everybody's watching
Yeah just like that
Mmm Now we're talkin
Where did your friends go
We lost track of time
Its almost last call
Its just you and I
You wrote your number down
I put it in my pocket
We were strangers
Now we're talkin
Tell me where ya from
Tell me what ya drinking
Tell me who you are
What you like What you thinkin
Tell me with your lips while everybody's watching
Yeah just like that
Mmm Now we're talkin
Dont ever want this night to end
Baby tell me tell me again and again
Tell me where ya from
Tell me what ya drinking
Tell me who you are
What you like What you thinkin
Tell me with your lips while everybody's watching
Yeah just like that
Mmm Now we're talkin
