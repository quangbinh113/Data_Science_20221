Song Name: Boomtown to Bust
I still can remember
Those last dying embers
Of that night we called it a day
Came down from the high wire
To put out the last fire
Of the love we kept hidden away
I still can remember
When our love was tender
And nothing could drag me away
But now I can see you
As the smoke clears from my view
We've said all there is to say
Roll up the sidewalks, Empty the mailbox
Saddle up the horses, We're back to the boondocks
From iron to rust, Boomtown to bust
Not all that glitters is gold
So I'll take the high road
Letting go of this load
That's weighing so heavy on me
We got caught in a landslide
Taken by a riptide
Leaving our love lost at sea
Roll up the sidewalks, Empty the mailbox
Saddle up the horses, We're back to the boondocks
From iron to rust, Boomtown to bust
Not all that glitters is gold
There may be a glow
But honey now we know
Not all that glitters stays gold
Not all that glitters stays gold
