Song Name: Sweet Southern Wind
Back road blacktop through Wilkes County
Making my way back from I-20
Keeping a sharp eye out for the state patrol
Two windows down, pushing near 80
Flying so high because here lately
I've been flying out of control
And I've been everywhere but home in the last 96 day
Doing time out on that lost highway
Singing my songs and counting up my sins
But now I'm back on the wings of the sweet southern wind
Sweet southern wind won't you carry me home?
Too far gone for far too long
So I left a little blood in a tattoo parlor
Met a girl in Nashville, told her I'd call her
And that's been three weeks ago today
Because the further I get from that little hour
The more I start thinking bout Red Cannas flowers
And the Colbert 4th of July parade
And that's just one little town
In a whole county of people of which I'm so proud
Going back to where my heart's always been
Coming in on the wings of the sweet southern wind
Louisiana, Dothan Alabama
Nashville, Tennessee, Charleston S.C.
Everywhere around and in between
Different faces, different places
Ain't got nothing on where I call home
Just come on by and you'll see
Forget the things that you heard
Around here we like to raise hell
And "ain't" is a word
Where my life began and where by the grace of God it will end
Gone away on the wings of the sweet southern wind
