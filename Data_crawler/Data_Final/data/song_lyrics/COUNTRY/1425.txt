Song Name: Side of the Stage
I want a house on a hill and a household name
I want a number one plaque in a golden frame
And take a private jet to White Caps, white sand
I wanna be the one in a one in a million chance
I wanna sing my songs to a sold-out crowd
Make 'em lose their minds when the lights go down
Feel the rush, pack it up, take the bus to the next place
But what's it all worth at the end of the day
If there ain't nobody on the side of the stage?
I've been missing my siblings, mom and dad
But I've been so busy, I don't text them back
Barely been back home in a whole damn year
Barely got friends there, barely got friends here
And 'cause I'm busy tryna sing my songs to a sold-out crowd
Make 'em lose their minds when the lights go down
Feel the rush, pack it up, take the bus to the next place
But what's it all worth at the end of the day
If there ain't nobody on the side of the stage?
Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
It might make a good living, don't make a good life
I can't find the one, if I can't find the time
Am I trading my dream of a family
Tryna fill every one of them stadium seats?
And just so I can sing my songs to a sold-out crowd
Make 'em lose their minds when the lights go down
Feel the rush, pack it up, take the bus to the next place
But what's it all worth at the end of the day
If there ain't nobody on the side of the stage?
Don't wanna wake up when it's all too late
And there ain't nobody on the side of the stage
