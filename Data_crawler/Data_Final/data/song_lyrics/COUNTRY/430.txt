Song Name: Something to Be Proud Of
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be

I just roll my eyes and make a b-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15s through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high, as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a-flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18
'Cause when you got a fast car, you think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTOs don't run off faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage

I fell in love, next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said, "Let me tell you right now"
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million
Just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of
And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a-flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of
