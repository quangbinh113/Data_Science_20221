Song Name: Your Momma Still Does
I thought we had a good thing goin'
It kinda had a ring to it
I thought if anybody ever coulda made it to forever
That me and you could do it
But I ain't the only one holdin' on
Hopin' you'll change your mind
You don't even think about pickin' up the phone
You don't even think about sayin' you were wrong
You don't even miss what me and you had
Yeah, I bet you don't even think about that
You don't even call me sayin' you're sorry
And you messed up
But your mama still does
It's usually 'bout twice a week
After one of her five o'clock drinks
We talk about the weather and the news
And we try not to, but we talk about you
But you don't even think about pickin' up the phone
You don't even think about sayin' you were wrong
You don't even miss what me and you had
Yeah, I bet you don't even think about that
You don't even call me sayin' you're sorry
And you messed up
Yeah, but your mama still does
But you don't even think about pickin' up the phone
You don't even think about sayin' you were wrong
You don't even miss what me and you had
No, I bet you don't even think about that
You don't even call me sayin' you're sorry
And you messed up
No, you don't even call me sayin' you're sorry
And you messed up
Your mama still does
Yeah, but your mama still does
Your mama still does
