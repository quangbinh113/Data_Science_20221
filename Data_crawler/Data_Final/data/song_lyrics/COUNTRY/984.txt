Song Name: 20/10 TN
One, two, three
Hey, it's me
I'm just wondering where you are
I woke up late
I think the game's about to start
You know where I'll be
Just sitting here at home, let's go Tennessee
Me again
You won't believe what just went down
Third and goal, a fake reverse, and around
Even fooled the referee
Just had to let you know, its seven-zip, Tennessee
And by the way I meant to say, that I'm sorry 'bout last night
I didn't mean to make you cry
But did you really mean goodbye?
I swear to God, I'm gonna change
Turn this fool I've been around
Yeah, I believe in miracles,
'Cause hell, I'm watching one right now
And girl, you won't believe
It's going into half
Ten-nothing,Tennessee
We scored again
That's all I called again to say, it got real close
But just like you, we pulled away
Almost out of reach
But it ain't over yet
Now hold on, Tennessee
I swear to God, I'm gonna change
Turn this fool I've been around
Yeah, I believe in miracles
'Cause hell, I'm watching one right now
Girl, you won't believe
Two minutes left
Looking good, Tennessee
It should have been another best day of my life
But girl, I feel kinda like the Crimson Tide
With time running out on me
With no Hail Mary chance
20-10, Tennessee
