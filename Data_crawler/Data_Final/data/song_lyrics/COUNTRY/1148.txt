Song Name: The Devil Always Made Me Think Twice
I take a little smoke in the evenin'
I take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind on killin' my mind
It's the kind of thing I like
Oh, it's just the kind of thing I like
The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I knew I was diggin' my grave
Well, you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Yeah, you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Mama always set a good example
My daddy always gave me good advice
And Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me think twice
Someday I'm goin' six feet under
And Lord, when I'm standin' at the gate
They'll tally my sins, they won't let me in
Say "Girl, you're just a little too late"
"Yeah, girl, you're just a little too late"
My mama always set a good example
My daddy always gave me good advice
And Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Yeah, mama always set a good example
My daddy always gave me good advice
And Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me
The devil always made me
The devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me
The devil always made me
The devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me
The devil always made me
The devil always made me think twice
The devil always made me
The devil always made me
The devil always made me think twice
