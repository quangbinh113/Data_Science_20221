Song Name: Where You Are - Acoustic
I've been high, I've been low, I've been everywhere a soul can go
I've seen the Northern Lights and heaven too
But I ain't ever seen anything like you
If you ever need somebody down the road
You should know
I'd stand in any ticket line
Any mountain I would climb
Just to find my way to where you are
I would swim across the sea
I would cut down any tree
Leave a trail through a forest in the dark
Pave a path to get back to where you are
And if you need a light to shine
I'll buy you any star hanging in the sky
Oh and if this world it breaks your heart
Break mine in two and take the other part
Well you know it already belongs to you
And it's true
I'd stand in any ticket line
Any mountain I would climb
Just to find my way to where you are
I would swim across the sea
I would cut down any tree
Leave a trail through a forest in the dark
Pave a path to get back to where you are
Ooh-yeah-yeah
Oh to reach I would never stop
I'd keep searching for you 'round the clock
I sing your praises everywhere I go
You should know
You should know
I'd stand in any ticket line
Any mountain I would climb
Just to find my way to where you are
Oh I would swim across the sea
I would cut down any tree
Leave a trail through a forest in the dark
Pave a path to get back to where you are
Pave a path to get back to where you are
