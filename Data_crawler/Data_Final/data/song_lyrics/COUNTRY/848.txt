Song Name: Two-Step 'Round The Christmas Tree
There's a wonderous sight and a joyful sound
Every Christmas Eve in a western town
Gather up the kids all the friends and family
'Cause the holly's hung and the candle's bright
Tuning up a fiddle on a moon lit night
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas tree
There's a jolly man in a bright red suit
Did you ever see a Santa in cowboy boots
Twirling across the floor spurs a-jingling merrily
As they sing those carols soft and low
We'll all be shouting out cotton-eyed Joe
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas tree
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
'Cause a western girl can't be still
And a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas Tree
Red Bandanas, kelly green
Silver buckles on a new blue jeans
Jumpin' 'round the room to a yule tide melody
I'm gonna be ready when Santa's comes
But I'm gonna be dancing 'til he does
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas tree
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
"Cause a western girl can't be still
And a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas Tree
Roll back the rug so we can
Two step 'round the Christmas Tree...
