Song Name: Red Wine or Whiskey
Baby tell me
Did you have a long week
Burning at both ends
Running on no sleep
Tell me when you're getting home
Cause I ain't one to drink alone
So come and kick your boots up
When your shift is over
A little more buzz on
A little less sober
If you wanna get it going
Then go on and pick your poison
If you wanna giddy up
Or if you wanna slow down
Should I put my best black dress on
Or leave it on the ground
Do you want some Marvin Gaye
Or some George Strait
Do you want the sweet talk
Or a straight shot
Well babe either way
I can mess you up real good or leave you tipsy
I can be your red wine or whiskey
With a little number seven
We gonna get to getting
Down to the bar
Where we ain't gonna get in
You know Jack it hits me fast
I can't help but shoot 'em back
A deep red merlot
Gives me a good glow
We can talk all night
Keep it on the down low
But a California Cab
Yeah it makes me want you bad
So if you wanna giddy up
Or if you wanna slow down
Should I put my best black dress on
Or leave it on the ground
Do you want some Marvin Gaye
Or some George Strait
Do you want the sweet talk
Or a straight shot
Well babe either way
I can mess you up real good or leave you tipsy
I can be your red wine or whiskey
If you wanna giddy up
Or if you wanna slow down
Should I put my best black dress on
Or leave it on the ground
Do you want some Marvin Gaye
Or some George Strait
Do you want the sweet talk
Or a straight shot
Well babe either way
I can mess you up real good or leave you tipsy
I can be your red wine or whiskey
Red wine or whiskey
