Song Name: With You Gone
A slowed car drivin' 45
With your headlights set to run
I told you it'd be okay
But my gut says it's all wrong
One look at you and I see your tears
Soft glow to a beam of light
And then my heart drains out
As I watch the life leave your eyes
So baby how
Can I keep down this endless road
With you gone
Made fool to a sinner's hope
Leave me here
And take the wheel
From a man that's too far gone
Baby how can I
Forget and just move on
With you gone
The phone lit up with frantic calls
From people of our past
Vultures disguised as saints
To take what you didn't have
I'm smoke shoppin for a scent of you
Take a slow drag from the pack
Light it quick and burn that shit
With the highway at my back
So baby how
Can I keep down this endless road
With you gone
Made fool to a sinner's hope
Leave me here
And take the wheel
From a man that's too far gone
Baby how can I
Forget and just move on
With you gone
Now I'm here standing
In front, where you now lay
Flowers comfort you
As they dance atop your grave
Memories rain down
When I need you most
So baby come back to me
When the good Lord calls me home
And baby now
I'm cruising down the same old road
And you're gone
I'm far past damaged, turned to broke
You left me here
So take the wheel
From a man that's drunk and gone
Sippin' down my drink
And wondering
If life's worth the moving on
With you gone
With you gone
