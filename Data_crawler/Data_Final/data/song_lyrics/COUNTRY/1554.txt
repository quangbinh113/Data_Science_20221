Song Name: Walking The Floor Over You - 1941 Single Version
You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back and just that day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you loved me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
