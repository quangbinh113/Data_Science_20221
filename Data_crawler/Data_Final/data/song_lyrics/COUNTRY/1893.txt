Song Name: First Rodeo
She got that boot stomp, stomp doin' that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk goin' out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hittin' the floor
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo (rodeo, rodeo)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
Right out the gate, right when I seen her
Bought her a drink, man, I was sold
Yeah, she could pearl snap her fingers
And I'd get that girl whatever she wants
Look like Annie-O in that neon glow
While she drop it low tonight
She got that boot stomp, stomp doin' that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk goin' out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hittin' the floor
All I know (all I know), all I know (all I know)
She got me all worked up on a Saturday night
She got them jeans hangin' on like an eight-second ride
She got that lasso look, baby pullin' me close
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo (rodeo, rodeo)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She got me shooting down my second triple crown
I gotta giddy up, show her what I'm about
I'm talkin' side to side, spin her around and around
'Round, 'round
She got that boot stomp, stomp doin' that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk goin' out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hittin' the floor
All I know (all I know), all I know (all I know)
She got me all worked up on a Saturday night
She got them jeans hangin' on like an eight-second ride
She got that lasso look, baby pullin' me close
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo (rodeo, rodeo)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
