Song Name: I Just Want You
How is it the girl who don't ask for a thing
Is the one you wanna give everything to
For her a good morning kiss with a hot cup of coffee will do
She thinks the perfect night out is a swing on the porch
Watching that sun disappear
But I swear if she'd only let me
I'd give her every last red sunset I ever get
And man if she asked me, I'd rope her the moon
They couldn't grow enough red roses
And heaven knows if they did I'd buy 'em all
As soon as they bloom
I'd give her anything, everything
If she'd just say I just want you
I grew up thinking that the measure of a man
Was money and the size of her ring
Then she proved me wrong
When she came along and changed everything
Man she changed everything
I'd give her every last red sunset I ever get
And man if she asked me, I'd rope her the moon
They couldn't grow enough red roses
And heaven knows if they did I'd buy 'em all
As soon as they bloom
I'd give her anything, everything
If she'd just say I just want you
I just want you
How is it the girl who don't ask for a thing
Is the one you wanna give everything to
I'd give her every last red sunset I'd ever get
And man if she asked me, I'd rope her the moon
They couldn't grow enough red roses
And heaven knows if they did I'd buy 'em all
As soon as they bloom
I'd give her anything, everything
If she'd just say I don't want anything
I got everything right here
I just want you
I just want you
