Song Name: All Summer
I know it sounds clich√©
We're makin' eyes across the pool all day
And I don't need you but it feels that way
And I don't ever let myself feel that way
But here I am gettin' tan, drinkin' wine on the water
And it's easy and it's fun if you want and if I want
I'll be your dream in between and your meantime lover
All summer, all summer, all summer
I'll let you buy my drink
Let you in on every thought I think
And baby, I admit that I don't get like this
Somethin' 'bout your lips
I don't know what this is
But here I am gettin' tan, drinkin' wine on the water
And it's easy and it's fun if you want and if I want
I'll be your dream in between and your meantime lover
All summer, all summer
I let it go, let it go, let it go on the water
And it's only getting hotter until I wanna stop
I'll be your dream in between and your meantime lover
All summer (meantime lover)
All summer (meantime lover)
All summer
I just have to let you know (I just have to let you know)
I don't have to let you go (I don't have to let you go)
All summer
All summer
But here I am gettin' tan, drinkin' wine on the water
And it's easy and it's fun if you want and if I want
I'll be your dream in between and your meantime lover
All summer, all summer
I let it go, let it go, let it go on the water
And it's only getting hotter and until I wanna stop
I'll be your dream in between and your meantime lover
All summer, all summer, all summer
