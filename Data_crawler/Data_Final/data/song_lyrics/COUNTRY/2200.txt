Song Name: My Ex Came Over
There's some buddies at the bar again
The one she said she'd never stepped foot in
And I had just enough
To answer back when my phone lit up
Boys said, "You gotta be kidding me"
When I said she said she was missing me
Rolled their eyes, I texted back
Called a cab and that was that
My ex came over last night
(No I ain't gonna lie)
We both know that it ain't right
(Ain't got nothing to hide)
Nothing new, it's the same old story
Right back to the things we swore we
Wouldn't do, last time was the last time, but
My ex came over last night
Shoulda seen my roommate's face
When she parked her car out in front of our place
Ain't the first, won't be the last
Hard to leave her loving in the past
Knew what I was getting into
She wore them jeans, that same perfume
Did some time traveling to some old habits
Right back at it like nothing happened
My ex came over last night
(No I ain't gonna lie)
We both know that it ain't right
(Ain't got nothing to hide)
Nothing new, it's the same old story
Right back to the things we swore we
Wouldn't do, last time was the last time, but
My ex came over last night
My ex came over last night
That on again then off again
That call it quits then call again
Yeah, here we go again
My ex came over last night
My ex came over last night
(No I ain't gonna lie)
We both know that it ain't right
(Ain't got nothing to hide)
Nothing new, it's the same old story
Right back to the things we swore we
Wouldn't do, last time was the last time, but
My ex came over last night
My ex came over last night
My ex came over last night
