Song Name: The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
And Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
They help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way (on his way)
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh (candy canes, 'lectric trains)
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!
(And so I'm offering this simple phrase)
(To kids from one to 92)

Merry Christmas to you!
