Song Name: Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound
I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes Lord she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
But don't play I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
[ Fiddle - steel ]. Sure enough about closin' time
'Bout stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun comes thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me the songs about a ramblin' man put old Jim Beam in my hand
Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't play Your Cheatin' Heart that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Yeah old Hank's songs always make me feel low down
