Song Name: Way of the Triune God - Jubilee Version
Gimme that old time, screaming and shouting
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubting
Way of the Triune God
I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit moving
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're using
Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is, I'm here to witness
Old time, screaming and shouting
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubting
Way of the Triune God
I don't need the laws of man
Tell me what I ought to do
He retched down and touched my hand
And gave me quite a talkin', too
Gave it to me, strict in charge
Something simple I could ponder
Till the role is called on high
Till we all meet over Yonder
Old time, screaming and shouting
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubting
Way of the Triune God
I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit moving
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're using
Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is I'm here to witness
Jesus said he'd go before
And come back when the house was finished
All this sin and waging war
My God's coming
Old time, screaming and shouting
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubting
Way of the Triune God
That old time, screaming and shouting
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubting
Way of the Triune God
Way of the Triune God
Way of the Triune God
