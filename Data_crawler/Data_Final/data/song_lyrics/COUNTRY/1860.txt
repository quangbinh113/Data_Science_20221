Song Name: Waiting for the Thunder
Light the fuse and run now brother cause you ain't got a lot of time
Don't you act surprised when it all goes to hell on your dime
Maybe you can stand tall enough to look the devil eye to eye
But you better make your get away quick so you don't have to answer why
The bells will ring and the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will blow and the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder
Or will the lightning get us all
Waiting for the thunder
All the money and the war and religion and the which one do you serve
Maybe them with the power and the glory got more than they deserve
Why do we stand by and do nothing while they piss it all away
And we hope we wake up in the morning to the light of a brand new day
The bells will ring and the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will blow and the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder
Or will the lightning get us all
The bells will ring and the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will blow and the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder
Will the lightning get us all
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the thunder
