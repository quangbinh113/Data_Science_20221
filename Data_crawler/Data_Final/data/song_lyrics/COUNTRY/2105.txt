Song Name: Amos Moses
Yeah, here comes Amos
Now, Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by hisself in the swamp
He hunted alligator for living
He'd just knock them in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gon' get you Amos
It ain't legal hunting alligator down in the swamp, boy
Now everybody blamed his old man
For making him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist
And throw him in the swamp
Alligator man in the Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Tippitoe Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses, yeah
Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left 'cause alligator bit it
Left arm gone, clean up to the elbow
Well, the sheriff caught wind that Amos
Was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well, I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
Well, you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Tippitoe Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses
Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, son
About 45 minutes southeast of Tippitoe Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hannah
