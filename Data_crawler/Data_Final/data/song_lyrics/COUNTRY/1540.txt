Song Name: This Time
This time I know, I won't be falling apart
This time I already know you won't be breaking my heart
You won't hear me, hear me cry
Baby I, babe I ain't gat the time
I've shared bitter tears, failed to speak erect
I've know happiness and pain
Spend so many years, between love and loneliness that it all, all feels the same
This time I know, I won't be falling apart
This time I already know you won't be breaking my heart
You won't hear me, hear me cry
Baby I, babe I ain't gat the time
I've seen goodluck come, better luck go
I've seen the greatest love slip away
I've been up on high
Way down below
And I know that loving back brings the Brightest day
This time I know, I won't be falling apart
This time I already know you won't be breaking my heart
You won't hear me, hear me cry
Baby I, babe I ain't gat the time
Used to close my eye when my world fold up
You held my hand but you couldn't hold my heart
Now I've found love and this love has found a side inside of me, in somebody
This time I know, I won't be falling apart
This time I already know you won't be breaking my heart
You won't hear me, hear me cry
Baby I, babe I ain't gat the time
Ohhhhohhh this time
