Song Name: Tears the Size of Texas
Baby, I've always been a cowboy
Just my guitar, my horses, and gun
Like the movies, I leave with the setting sun
And if I was you baby, I'd run
'Cause you'll be crying tears the size of Texas
The California coast crashin' in on your porch
Daisy, 'fore you go and do something reckless
Know how wild my west is
And maybe you can call all my exes
They meet up at that church every week for support
Before the judge convicts me
Girl, I'm here confessing
I ain't one to mess with
'Cause you'll be crying tears the size of Texas
Your mama gon' curse my god-damn name
Your brothers put a bounty on my head
The weatherman says it's a hundred 'cent chance
Heartbreak gon' rain again
You'll be crying tears the size of Texas
The California coast crashin' in on your porch
Daisy, 'fore you go and do something reckless
Know how wild my west is
And maybe you can call up all my exes
They meet up at that church every week for support
Before the judge convicts me
Girl, I'm here confessin'
I ain't one to mess with
'Cause you'll be cryin' tears the size of Texas
(Oh)
Yeah, I swear
Daisy, every dog has its day
Daisy, I'm just calling to say
I've been cryin' tears the size of Texas
The Corpus Christi coast floodin' my porch
Why'd I have to go and do something reckless
I know how wild the west is
Daisy, don't be 'nother one of my exes
Heaven knows 'round here it's been a hell of a storm
This old desperado finna learn his lesson
I hope you get this message
That I've been crying tears the size of Texas
I've been crying tears the size of Texas
