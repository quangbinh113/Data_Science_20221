Song Name: Hurt No More
Every damn thing reminds me of you
I still can't believe all that I put you through
I try to forget that you ain't really here
Just a voice in my head
Just a ghost in the mirror
It's been comin' down for this
And it's too late to change my looks
Keep tryin' till it doesn't hurt no more
Still see you cryin' walkin' out that door
I think I'm gonna need
A little time to breathe
Keep tryin' on it 'til the rain don't hurt no more
I'm out of my mind
Walkin' holes in the floor
And killin' some time
Killin' my health some more
You can blame it on me
I'll blame it all on the wind
If the storm clouds will leave
We could be together
But it's been comin' down for this
And it's to late to change my ways
Keep tryin' 'til it doesn't hurt no more
Still see you cryin' walkin' out that door
I think I'm gonna need
A little time to breathe
Keep tryin' on it till the rain don't hurt no more
Keep tryin' 'til it doesn't hurt no more
Still see you cryin' walkin' out that door
I think I'm gonna need
A little time to breathe
Keep tryin' on it till the rain don't hurt no more
'Til the rain don't hurt no more
Mmm
