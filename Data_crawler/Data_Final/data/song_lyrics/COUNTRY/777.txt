Song Name: Happy Anywhere (feat. Gwen Stefani)
I've always been a rolling stone
With a reckless streak
Yeah, the grass never gets too grown
Underneath my feet
The city lights, Southern stars
No such thing as gone too far
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you
Yeah, the beauty of the northern lights
In my mind is faded
The blue sky over Telluride
Next to you is kinda overrated
The winding road, let it twist
My home's wherever your heart is
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you
Hey!
Hey!
So, girl, I hope you know
Wherever you go, I go, I know
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

I could be happy anywhere with you
