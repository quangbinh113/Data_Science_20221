Song Name: Pickup Man
Well, I got my first truck, when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks, and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
When I turned 16, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a Pickup Truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab, and said
"I never knew you were a Pickup Man!"
You can set my truck on fire, roll it down a hill
But I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
Most Friday nights, I can be found
In the back of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
You can set my truck on fire, roll it down a hill
But I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
A bucket of rust, or a brand-new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean
You can set my truck on fire, roll it down a hill
But I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
You know there's something women like about a Pickup Man
