Song Name: Simple Things - Piano Version
Small town living gets old when you've got big dreams
Feels like you can only think as far as you can see
18, tatted up, tryna sell weed
Knowing I'd take the fall for the whole team
Wasn't tryna hear it every time that you told me
It's the sound of the rain coming down when you fall asleep
It's a call from a friend that you love but never get to see
All the time you can waste tryna chase what you'll never need
Hope you come back around to simple things
How's it been four, five years since I got down on my knees?
And how could I forget the sweet smell
Of the honeysuckles in the breeze?
Would've never thought tryna chase this dream
Would give me nightmares, now I get no sleep
Nowadays, seems like the only thing that calms me
It's the sound of the rain coming down when you fall asleep
It's a call from a friend that you love but never get to see
All the time you can waste tryna chase what you'll never need
Always comes back around to simple things
Like a song that you know from the past coming on
When you need it so bad
Like a drink in your glass at the end of the day
That you needed to have
Yeah, I try and still sometimes I mess it up
Lately, I been asking myself, "What's enough?"
It's the sound of the rain coming down when you fall asleep
It's a call from a friend that you love but never get to see
All the time you can waste tryna chase what you'll never need
Always comes back around to simple things
Simple things
