Song Name: Where the Neon Lies (with Ronnie Dunn)
The cold hard truth
Lives inside these four walls
Her shadow's in every room
She echoes down these halls
Her memory's too strong to fight
Reality's too hard to face
So I spend every night
In a barstool kind of place
Where the neon lies, everything's alright
Whiskey melts a cold goodbye
Yeah, the jukebox plays and my heart don't break
'Cause I believe that she'll come back in time
Where the neon lies
She won't find someone else
'Cause she'll miss me way too bad
In here, I convince myself
Oh, she'll want what we had
Beer after beer
I chase this whiskey down
In this buzzin' blue light atmosphere
The truth don't hang around
Where the neon lies, everything's alright
Whiskey melts a cold goodbye
Yeah, the jukebox plays and my heart don't break
'Cause I believe that she'll come back in time
Oh, where the neon lies
Yeah, that jukebox plays so my heart don't break
Oh, 'cause I believe that she'll be back in time
I start seein' things in a different light
Where the neon lies
Where the neon lies
Oh, where the neon lies
