Song Name: Stay A Little Longer
Yeah, something like a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really I shouldn't be
Give her one more call
Just one more "Whatcha doin right now?"
Just one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
To one more, "Here we go again"
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
While I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone and picking up the phone
It's one more call
Just one more "Whatcha doin right now?"
Just one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
To one more "Here we go again"
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm out here wishing you could stay a little longer
Yeah one more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm out here wishing you could stay a little longer
Stay a little longer

Wishing you could stay a little longer, hmm
Ohh
