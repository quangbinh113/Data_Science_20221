Song Name: Other Than That
Lord, it's good to be in Rogers County
I sure love this place
I know everyone around me
And these days, they know my name
My brother's got himself a family
Mom and Dad, They're doing fine
Caleb's working down at Holly
And Zach finally hit it big time
Me, I'm doing fine, I swear
I don't think of you at all
It's coming to an end, I fear
Cause' pride it goes before a fall
I'm wasting every breath I get on
Songs that just won't change your mind
Other than that, I'm doing fine
Other than that, I'm doing fine
I see you in my dreams fairly often
And hear you every time I close my eyes
Telling me you wish that I'd quit talking
And begging me to kiss you one more time
You ain't come around here since that evening
I told you I couldn't be your friend
Cause' I just can't quit feeling what I'm feeling
And you can't seem to let me in
Me, I'm doing fine, I swear
I don't think of you at all
It's coming to an end, I fear
Cause' pride it goes before a fall
I'm wasting every breath I get on
Songs that just won't change your mind
Other than that, I'm doing fine
Other than that, I'm doing fine
