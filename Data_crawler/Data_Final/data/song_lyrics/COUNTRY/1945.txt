Song Name: Never Been in Love
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been
It's the look on your face when you look at me
Makes my heart skip a beat
Damn, it's good to be yours
So good to be yours
It's the way that you talk when you speak to me
Just the thought of your voice
Boy, it's keepin' me up
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in love
Like I've never held a hand before
'Cause I've never held a hand like yours
Like it's the first time I'm kissin' someone again
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been-
Brokenhearted, cryin' all night long
Like every single scar I got is gone
Like forever would still never be enough
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in love
Never knew I could laugh 'til I couldn't breathe
Never thought I could show someone all of me
Things are better than they've ever been
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in love
Like I've never held a hand before
'Cause I've never held a hand like yours
Like it's the first time I'm kissin' someone again
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been-
Brokenhearted, cryin' all night long
Like every single scar I got is gone
Like forever would still never be enough
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in love
Like I've never been in love
Yeah
Like I've been colorblind all my life
Now I'm seeing more than black and white
And it's beautiful, it's kinda like
I wasn't me until you
Everything is brand new
Like I've never held a hand before
'Cause I've never held a hand like yours
Like it's the first time I'm kissin' someone again
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never beenâ€“
Brokenhearted, cryin' all night long (yeah)
Like every single scar I got is gone
Like forever would still never be enough
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in love
Yeah
Like I've never been in love
You make me feel, make me feel like I've never been in-
