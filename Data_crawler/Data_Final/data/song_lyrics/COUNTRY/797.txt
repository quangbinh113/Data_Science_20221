Song Name: Ocean
How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're world away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim, but the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean, beautiful, and blue
I wanna swim in you
Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And I've done it outta love is not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim, but the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean, beautiful, and blue
I wanna swim in you
I can't let it go for months in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the wave
The waves, the waves
The waves, the waves
The waves, the waves
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim, but the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean, beautiful, and blue
I wanna swim in you
