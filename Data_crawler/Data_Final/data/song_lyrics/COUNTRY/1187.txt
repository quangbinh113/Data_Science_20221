Song Name: Talladega
It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it
To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega
Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
Til the Alabama sun was breaking.
Over Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega
When the winds go cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind.
Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega
Talladega
Talladega
