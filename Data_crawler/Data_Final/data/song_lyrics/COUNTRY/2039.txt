Song Name: Don't Come Lookin'
One, two, a-three, a-three
Got a head full of noise
'Bout a hundred different things I'm tryna avoid
I got a mind in the gutter
Trouble on one hand, a beer in the other
Got the windows down and my fingers crossed
Just looking for a brand-new way to get lost
So long, four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas, down the road, I'm burnin'
Can't say I would
And I can't say I wouldn't
And if I don't come back
Don't come lookin'
Feels good, about time
Blue skies ahead and B.S. behind
Got the wind in my hair
Got nowhere to go so I'm already there
Maybe Moab, maybe the Rockies
Maybe the Great Soft Plains, or the hills of Kentucky
Maybe North, maybe South
I don't care as long as it's now
So long
Four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas, down the road, I'm burnin'
Can't say I would
And I can't say I wouldn't
And if I don't come back
Don't come lookin'
Come on-on-on-on
If you wanna get down tonight
Come on-on-on-on
If ya lookin' for a real good time
Come on-on-on-on
If you kinda wanna lose your mind
So long
Four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas, down the road, I'm burnin'
Can't say I would
And I can't say I wouldn't
And if I don't come back
Don't come lookin'
So long
Four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas, down the road, I'm burnin'
Can't say I would
And I can't say I wouldn't
And if I don't come back
Don't come lookin'
