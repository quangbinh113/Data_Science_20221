Song Name: Good Hearted Woman
A long time forgotten, the dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised, ain't what she's livin' today
(Really?)
But she never complains of the bad times
Or the bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
Through tear-drops and laughter, they pass through this world hand in hand
A good-hearted woman, lovin' a good timin' man
He likes the bright lights, and night-life, and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over, she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows, she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can
A-this a-good hearted woman, lovin' a good timin' man
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways that she don't understand
Through tear-drops and laughter they pass through this world hand in hand
A good-hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways, she don't understand
