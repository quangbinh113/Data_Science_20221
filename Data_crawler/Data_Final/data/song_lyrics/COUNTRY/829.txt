Song Name: Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Oh The Weather Outside Is Frightful
But The Fire Is So Delightful
And Since We've No Place To Go
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
It Doesn't Show Signs Of Stopping
And I've Brought Some Corn For Popping
The Lights Are Turned Way Down Low
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
When We Finally Kiss Goodnight
How I'll Hate Going Out In The Storm
But If You Really Hold Me Tight
All The Way Home I'll Be Warm
Oh The Fire Is Slowly Dying
And My Dear, We're Still Goodbye'ing
But As Long As You Love Me So
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
When We Finally Kiss Goodnight
How I'll Hate Going Out In The Storm
But If You Really Hold Me Tight
All The Way Home I'll Be Warm
Oh The Fire Is Slowly Dying
(My Career Is Slowly Dying)
And My Dear, We're Still Goodbye'ing
But As Long As You Love Me So
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
