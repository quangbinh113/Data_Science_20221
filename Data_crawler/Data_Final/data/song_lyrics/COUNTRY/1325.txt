Song Name: Wolves
The howlin' moon would cry
I'd sleep the sun away
I was just a child
I knew I was afraid
There was nothin' to gain, I found
By runnin' the other way
I had to stand my ground
And keep the wolves at bay
But I knew somehow
There would come a day
So I stood my ground
Kept the wolves at bay
Would not take no more
Had my fill
Stars had faded from my eyes
And run from looks that kill
There was no one comin' around
To save me from the fray
I had to stand my ground
And keep the wolves at bay
But I knew somehow
There would come a day
When I stood my ground
Kept the wolves at bay
Well I knew somehow
There would come a day
So I stood my ground
Kept the wolves at bay
Years have gone by
And the callin' carries on
Scars above my eye
Are tender to the bone
And though I've settled down
I hear the children say
"You have to stand your ground
And keep the wolves at bay"
Well I knew somehow
There would come the day
When I stood my ground
Kept the wolves at bay
Well I knew somehow
There would come the day
So I stood my ground
Kept the wolves at bay
