Song Name: Worst Guy Ever
Pretty words don't call back
Never learn, unattached
I ain't sayin' that everybody out there acts the way you do
I'm just sayin' either way I can't imagine bein' you
You let her fall, then you're done
Break her heart, so much fun
Let another girl steal your sweatshirt
Always on the run for somethin' better
You make her think that it's real
Then call her crazy for how she feels
Don't know how you do it, I could never
Swear I'd be the worst guy evеr
'Cause I'd see girls, and I'd see daughters
And I'd hold on if I got her
Yеah, me and all my friends we've seen it all
I swear it's nothin' new
Guess that's why I think I gotta leave the leavin' up to you
To let her fall, then you're done
Break her heart, so much fun
Let another girl steal your sweatshirt
Always on the run for somethin' better
You make her think that it's real
Then call her crazy for how she feels
Don't know how you do it, I could never
Swear I'd be the worst guy ever, oh, no
Hm-hm
If I did that to someone
What would that say about me?
You're probably just hurtin', I know
But what if this time you don't?
Let her fall, then you're done
Break her heart, so much fun
Let another girl steal your sweatshirt
Always on the run for somethin' better
You make her think that it's real
Then call her crazy for how she feels
Don't know how you do it, I could never
Swear I'd be the worst guy ever
If I did that to someone (to someone)
What would that say about me?
You're probably just hurtin', I know (I know)
But what if this time you don't?
Be the worst guy ever
