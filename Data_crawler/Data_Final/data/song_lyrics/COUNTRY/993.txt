Song Name: Coming Down the Mountain
I was up to my elbows
You know the way it gets
I was lookin' for exits and I had far too many friends
So I packed up my suitcase
I threw away my phone
I told you I loved you, just I'd leave you alone
Then I went walking through the rhododendron flowers
Got me a fishin' pole
And it's been ten years now
But I'm comin' down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good time friends
The fishin' was fine but fishin' comes to an end
I'm comin' down the mountain again
I traded my trimmings
For a white cotton robe
I gave up my grudges and paid back all my loans
You fools in your cities
Think you got it made
The yoke of this hard lickin' world will break you to pieces someday
And you'll go walkin' through the rhododendron flowers
Lookin' for white robes
But the prophet won't be found
I'm comin' down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good time friends
The fishin' was fine but fishin' comes to an end
I'm comin' down the mountain again
Let's go walkin' through the rhododendron flowers
Isn't it lovely above the madding crowd?
I'm comin' down the mountain again
Get the word to all my good time friends
The fishin' was fine but fishin' comes to an end
I'm comin' down the mountain
Comin' down the mountain again
