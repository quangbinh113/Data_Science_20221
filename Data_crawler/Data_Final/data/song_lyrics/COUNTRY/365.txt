Song Name: Goodbye Earl
Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl
Well it wasn't two weeks
After she got married
That Wanda started getting abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care
Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand
As they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas?
They tasted all right to me Earl
You're feelin' weak?
Why don't you lay down
And sleep Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp Earl?
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said, "thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know"
Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to Summer
And Summer faded into Fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all
So the girls bought some land
And a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night
'Cause Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk Earl
Well is that all right?
Good! Let's go for a ride Earl Hey
Na na na na na na
Well hey hey hey
Na na na na na na
Aw hey hey hey
Na na na na na na
Well hey hey hey
Na na na na na na
