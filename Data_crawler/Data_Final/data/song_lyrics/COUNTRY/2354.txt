Song Name: Mind Bender
While browsing through a pawnshop,
I saw this old guitar,
Its keys were bent and rusted,
Its body scratched and scared
Holy Moses!
Would you believe that guitar began to talk.?
I swear it is
Now it started like a thinkin,
I wasn't stoned nor drinkin,
When I heard that talkin guitar say:
My daddy was a Gibson
My momma was a Fender
That's why they call me,
Mindbender,
Mindbender
That's my name
You better believe it
It was a mind bending thing.!
(Solo 1)
I said: Now listen, guitar,
What you're tryin to do?
People will think I'm crazy,
If they see me talkin to you .!
He said: What's that you say?
I said: You'd better hold your tongue.!
Now it started like a thinkin,
I wasn't stoned nor drinkin,
When, I swear, I heard that guitar say:
My daddy was a Gibson
My momma was a Fender
That's why they call me,
Mindbender, Mindbender
That's my name, my name
You'd better believe it, brother
It was a mind bending thing
(Solo 2)
