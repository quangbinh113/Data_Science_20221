Song Name: Christmas Day
Christmas day is here again
Time to see our long lost friends
And we have snow and wishes now
Mistletoe and kisses now
For the ones we love
I hear bells a-ringing now
Tiny tots are singing now
Everyone is feeling gay
What a lovely Christmas day
Thank you, Lord above
And here we are on Christmas morning
Everything seems so right
Children awake at the dawning
'Cause they saw Santa last night
Icy winds, but they are warm
All because my family's home
Yes, we'll rejoice in many ways
Givin' thanks and givin' praise
On this Christmas day
And here we are this Christmas morning
Yes, everything seems so right
The children awake at the dawning
'Cause they saw Santa last night
Icy winds, but they are warm
And all because my family's home
We'll rejoice in many ways
Giving thanks and giving praise
On this Christmas day
On this Christmas day
