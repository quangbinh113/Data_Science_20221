Song Name: I Love This Bar
We got winners
We got losers
Chain-smokers and boozers
We got yuppies
We got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I love this bar
We got cowboys
We got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers
We got fighters
Early-birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I love this bar
I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far
Come as you are
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I love this bar
I've seen short skirts
We've got high-techs
Blue-collared boys and rednecks
And we got lovers
Lots of lookers
I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I love this bar
(Yes I do)
I like my truck
I like my truck
And I like my girlfriend
I like my girlfriend
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then
But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just toein' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge
Come as you are
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I love this bar
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I just love this old bar
