Song Name: A Bar Without You
I could drink bourbon, I could drink wine
But I can't drink enough to get you off my mind
I could go dancing, have a good time
See that "Come on over" look in a stranger's eyes
You're everywhere I go, under every neon sky
Oh, it's almost like we never said goodbye
There ain't a bar without you in it
Ain't a drink, ain't a song, ain't a passing minute
That my heart ain't missing you
Wishing your drink was next to mine
Baby, don't you forget it
No, there ain't a bar
Without you in it
Without you in it
I could be uptown on a Saturday night
It could be Tuesday at a two dollar dive
No better feeling than living alone
I'm the last to walk in, and the first to go home
Oh, there ain't a bar without you in it
Ain't a drink, ain't a song, ain't a passing minute
That my heart ain't missing you
Wishing your drink was next to mine
Baby, don't you forget it
No, there ain't a bar
Without you in it
Without you in it, no
If I get a little wild, fly a little free
You'll never have to worry 'bout me
There ain't a bar without you in it
No
There ain't a bar without you in it
Ain't a drink, ain't a song, ain't a passing minute (no)
That my heart ain't missing you
Wishing your drink was next to mine
Baby, don't you forget it (don't you forget)
No, there ain't a bar
Without you in it (without you in it)
Without you in it
No
There ain't a bar (there ain't a bar)
There ain't a bar, without you in it
