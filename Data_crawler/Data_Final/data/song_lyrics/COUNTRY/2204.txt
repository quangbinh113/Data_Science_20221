Song Name: Down at the Twist and Shout
Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight
Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was gonna go
Down to Highway 10, past the Lafayette
There's the Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home
Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight (Hey!)
They got a alligator stew and a crawfish pie
A Gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin' on the Delta's quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says "Beausoleil is a-coming into town"
Baby let's go down
Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight (whoo!)
Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister, too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from a-1910
You gonna feel a little bit young again
Well you learned to dance with your rock'n'roll
You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-so-do
When you hear a little Jolie Blon
Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight
Hey, cher
