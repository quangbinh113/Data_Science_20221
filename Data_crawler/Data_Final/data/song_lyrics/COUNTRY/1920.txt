Song Name: Trust Issues
He wanted my body without knowing my name
He came on too strong, and he's gone the next day
He was a shot of tequila without the chase
Yeah, it's hard, but I'm taking it day by day
Yeah, he broke a heart that wasn't his to break
I don't need another heartbreak in the making
I don't need another boy who's seeing me naked
I can't fall in love if I leave ya'
You can't break my heart if I don't need ya'
I'll say, "Yes" to the first date, but never the second
Who's ignoring who, who's keeping who guessing?
Yeah, you have problems, I have 'em too
Yeah, I've got trust issues
I got trust issues, yeah
You say that you wait for a girl like me
You got your mama's eyes and your daddy's dreams
But from what I've learned, love always leaves
That's the way that it's always been
You probably shouldn't wait for a girl like me
'Cause I don't need another heartbreak in the making
I don't need another boy who's seeing me naked
I can't fall in love if I leave ya'
You can't break my heart if I don't need ya'
I'll say, "Yes" to the first date, but never the second
Who's ignoring who, who's keeping who guessing?
Yeah, you have problems, I have 'em too
Yeah, I've got trust issues
I got trust issues, yeah
And I can't do the back and forth's, yes and no's
Maybe this will be better if we took things slow
Maybe we could try in a month or so
But I don't want to try in a month or so
No, I'm just getting good at being alone

I don't need another heartbreak in the making
Don't need another boy who's seeing me naked
I can't fall in love if I leave ya'
You can't break my heart if I don't need ya'
I'll say, "Yes" to the first date, but never the second
Who's ignoring who, who's keeping who guessing?
Yeah, I can't tell if it's me or you
But I'm betting that it's me and not you
'Cause, I got trust issues
I got trust issues
I got trust issues
I got trust issues
I got trust issues
I got trust issues, yup
