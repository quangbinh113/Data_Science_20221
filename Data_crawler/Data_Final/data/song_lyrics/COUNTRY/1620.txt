Song Name: Don't Get Above Your Raising
Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see.
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now looky here gal don't you high hat me
I ain't forgot what you used to be.
When you didn't have nothing
That was plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me.
--- Instrumental ---
Now you need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For it don't mean nothing
To me you see.
Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me
Now looky here gal you better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf.
You're country baby
That's plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me.
--- Instrumental ---
Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see.
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me...
