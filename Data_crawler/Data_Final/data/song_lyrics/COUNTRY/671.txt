Song Name: One Man Band
Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing a harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No base, no guitar, no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's paying, we'll still be playing
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band
