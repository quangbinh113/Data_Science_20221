Song Name: I Wanna Talk About Me
Yeah, yeah
That's right
We talk about your work
How your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church
And your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother
And your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends
And the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the devils on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in a while
I wanna talk about me, wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one, oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know
What I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you usually
But occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me)
We talk about your dreams
And we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizing cream
We talk about your nana up in Munci, Indiana
We talk about your grandmaw down in Alabama
We talk about your guys
Of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart bout your brain and your smarts
And your medical charts
And when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then
I wanna talk about me, wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one, oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know
What I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you usually
But occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me)
I wanna talk about me
Me, me, me, me, me
I wanna talk about me
Me, me, me, me, me
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me, wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one, oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know
What I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you usually
But occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
Oh, me
