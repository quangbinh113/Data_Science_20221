Song Name: Get Your Shine On
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shine down on the radio dial
Homemade jar, lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop girl
You know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on, shine on
Baby get your shine on
Silverado, candy painted
Ray Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here
And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on, shine on
Baby get your shine on
Homemade jar, lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop girl
You know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on, shine on
Baby get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on, shine on
Baby get your shine on
Baby get your shine on
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shine down on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby get your shine on
