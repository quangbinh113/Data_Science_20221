Song Name: I See Stars
I see stars
It's been a long night, a long time
Since we've laid like this in the moonlight
Chasing shadows, losing battles
Got used to watching the clouds cry
But I'm looking up right now
And I see stars
And out of a million only one has got to fall
Yeah, I see stars
You and me, yeah, we don't need to catch them all
When you're beside me, there's a silver lining
Shining wherever you are
Yeah, I see stars
Like a slow dance, only you can
Stop the world from spinning out of my hands
Paint a new sky, when I'm flying blind
So even when I close my eyes
Yeah, I see stars
And out of a million only one has got to fall
Yeah, I see stars
You and me, yeah, we don't need to catch them all
When you're beside me, there's a silver lining
Shining wherever you are
Yeah, I see stars
I see stars (I see stars)
I see stars
I see stars (oh, yeah)
And only one has got to fall
Yeah, I see stars
You and me, yeah, we don't need to catch them all
When you're beside me, there's a silver lining
Shining wherever you are
I see stars
I see stars
I see stars
And out of a million only one has got to fall
Yeah, I see stars
