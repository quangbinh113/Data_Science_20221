Song Name: Out Yonder
Who's doin' lines? Who's huffin' glue?
Who's got a wife and a girlfriend too?
Who's in a bind? Whose screws are loose?
Who's sippin' wine while the kids are at school?
Who stirs the pot? Who's in your ear?
And whose bad idea was it to bring it 'round here?
It's all this he-said, she-said
Always two sides and the truth
There's so much shit around these parts
Gonna get some on your boots
It's just a straight line down the grapevine
Gotta rip it right up at the roots
You can keep your mouth runnin', hell, Jesus might love ya
But that don't mean I do
So take your front-page, two-faced, petty-ass drama
And leave it out, leave it out, leave it out yonder
Who's gained a few pounds? Who spends too much?
Who got knocked out? Who got knocked up?
Who's in hot water with the IRS?
Whose granddaddy died, still cashin' his checks?
Whose boss don't know 'bout a felony?
And why the hell are you tellin' me
All this he-said, she-said?
Always two sides and the truth
There's so much shit around these parts
Gonna get some on your boots
It's just a straight line down the grapevine
Gotta rip it right up at the roots
You can keep your mouth runnin', hell, Jesus might love ya
But that don't mean I do
So take your front-page, two-faced, petty-ass drama
And leave it out, leave it out, leave it out yonder
Keep it on movin'
Keep it on movin'
Leave it out yonder
It's all this he-said, she-said
Always two sides and the truth
There's so much shit around these parts
Gonna get some on your boots
It's just a straight line down the grapevine
Gotta rip it right up at the roots
You can keep your mouth runnin', hell, Jesus might love ya
But that don't mean I do
So take your front-page, two-faced, petty-ass drama
And leave it out, leave it out, leave it out yonder
Leave it out yonder (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Leave it out yonder
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
