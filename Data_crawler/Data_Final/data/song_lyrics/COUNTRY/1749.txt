Song Name: Lil Bit
What up, Nelly?
You ready to do another one, bruh?
Talk to 'em (uh, uh, uh, uh), haha
Yeah, runnin' all red lights
Pull up to the club, just to get, to get ahead, right
I do this shit er'ry night
You can call it limelight, I'ma call it my life
Shawty lookin' alright
TK jeans on, skin-skin-skintight
She be shakin' that taillight
Got me froze in the road like a deer in the headlights (uh, uh, yeah)
Oh, Backwoods, wanna know if you can roll
Got Cîroc on the rocks, ice-cold
Got the coupe on the new town road
Real low, oh
I know we just met, but, girl, let's roll
Let's roll, whoa, let's roll, let's roll
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Let's go, oh
And she said, "Take me to the country, show me where you from"
I said, "Shawty, you gon' love me and we gon' have some fun"
I'll break out my big wheel and you can climb on up
Girl, I think you a big deal, now show your boy some love
Huh, just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit (uh)
Just a lil' bit (yeah)
Just a lil' bit (uh)
We gon' have some fun
Just a lil' bit (uh)
Just a lil' bit (yeah)
Just a lil' bit
Yeah, we gon' have some-
Shawty messin' with a pro now (woo)
I'm a pro now
I'm the who, what, when, where to go now
Shows sold out
From the front to the back, hip-hop or the hoedown
Got the game on the go route
I'm the black Tom Brady in this, I'm the G.O.A.T. now (haha)
Shawty, I'm so wow
Orleans out to SoCal
Better know now
I know we just met, but, girl, let's roll
Let's roll, whoa, let's roll, let's roll
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Let's go, oh (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And she said, "Take me to the country, show me where you from" (let's ride)
I said, "Shawty, you gon' love me and we gon' have some fun"
I'll break out my big wheel and you can climb on up
Girl, I think you a big deal, now show your boy some love
Huh, just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit (yeah, baby, uh)
Just a lil' bit (yeah)
Just a lil' bit (uh)
We gon' have some fun
Just a lil' bit (uh)
Just a lil' bit (yeah)
Just a lil' bit (haha, uh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, Backwoods, wanna know if you can roll
Got Cîroc on the rocks, ice-cold
Got the coupe on the new town road (uh, uh, uh)
Real low, oh
Oh, Backwoods, wanna know if you can roll (can she roll?)
Got Cîroc on the rocks, ice-cold
Got the coupe on the new town road
Real low, oh
And she said, "Take me to the country, show me where you from"
I said, "Shawty, you gon' love me and we gon' have some fun" (we back, man)
I'll break out my big wheel and you can climb on up
Girl, I think you a big deal, now show your boy some love
Huh, just a lil' bit (ayy, ayy)
