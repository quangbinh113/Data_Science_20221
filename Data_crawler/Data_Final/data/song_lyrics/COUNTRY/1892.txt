Song Name: Good Goodbye (feat. Jimmie Allen)
Saw it comin' from a mile away
Sat a while in the driveway
Just me, you, and goodbye
Countin' down the time
Last chance for a memory
So, baby, tell me what it's gonna be
Cryin' here in the dashboard lights
Or headin' inside for one more night
I know this is over
And it isn't gonna change
But if we ain't gonna make it, baby
What you say we make it a good
Goodbye, love me for the last time
Wrap me in your arms like we never grew apart
Come and kiss my lips, take me back to when
You were all my heart was chasin'
If we're gonna say it, make it a good goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna be hell on earth
But when it's real that we'll never work
I know we're just puttin' off the hurt
But right now, I'm missin' when we were
All about each other
Never thought we'd turn the page
But if we ain't gonna make it, baby
What you say we make it a good
Goodbye, love me for the last time
Wrap me in your arms like we never grew apart
Come and kiss my lips, take me back to when
You were all my heart was chasin'
If we're gonna say it, make it a good goodbye
Let's make it a good goodbye
I know this is over
And it isn't gonna change
But if we gotta say it, baby
What you say we make it a good
Goodbye, love me for the last time
Wrap me in your arms like we never grew apart
Come and kiss my lips, take me back to when
You were all my heart was chasin'
If we're gonna say it, make it a good goodbye
Let's make it a good goodbye (make it a goodbye, baby, oh)
Saw it comin' from a mile away
Sat a while in the driveway
Me, you, and goodbye
