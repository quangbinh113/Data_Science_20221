Song Name: It Ain't Me
I think it's time we call it quits
I don't know much, but I'm sure
I didn't sign up for this
I'm tired of the cussin'
I'm tired of the fightin'
I'm sick of all your reasons
And all your damn whinin'
I don't know about you
But I think we're done
You can call up your friends
And cry to your mama
Talk shit about me
Start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do
As long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with everybody you know
Throw back some longnecks and hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me
You've been calling my phone
Every damn day
Saying, "Let's work it out"
Girl, there's no way
I know it ain't what you wanted to hear
You'll probably get mad and choke back a few tears
But karma's got a way of coming back around
You can call up your friends
And cry to your mama
Talk shit about me
Start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do
As long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with everybody you know
Throw back some longnecks, and hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me
You can call up your friends
Go cry to your mama
Talk shit about me
Start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do
As long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with every loser you know
Throw back some longnecks, hell hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me
