Song Name: This Is It
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff
Where Carolina meets the sky
Ooh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes
This is it, this is now, this is what I been talkin' 'bout
Lookin' out, can't you see forever
You take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it
Girl, I know that you been waitin' and talkin' to your friends
Wonderin' if and wonderin' where and wonderin' when
Well, I've been waitin' too, holdin' on to this ring
For the right words to say
For the right time and place, for me to get on one knee
This is it, this is now, this is what I been talkin' 'bout
Lookin' out, can't you see forever
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it
Now you're walkin' down the aisle
And I can't help but smile
This is it, this is now, it's what I been talkin' 'bout
Lookin' out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it

This is it
