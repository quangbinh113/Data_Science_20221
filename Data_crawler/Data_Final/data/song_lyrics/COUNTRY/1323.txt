Song Name: First Goodbye
I can't stop thinking 'bout the night when
You tucked me in and I said
You weren't supposed to be inside
Then I let you climb
Right into my bed
Sixteen
We had it easier
Never wanted to leave
I guess for what it's worth
But I know that you know we got some growing up to do
But you
Were my first star gazing in a pickup truck
Pick me up and stay out way past curfew
You were my first slow dancin' around the kitchen
Kissing when your mama wasn't home
And I'd do
Anything to live it again
But time ain't going back and life's still got it's living to do
You were my first love and baby tonight
You'll be my first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Bye
I can't stop going back and forth I
Keep asking myself
If freedom and growing is worth being alone but I
Guess it's too late now
And back then
We had it easier
Never wanted to leave
I say it and it hurts but I
Know that you know we can't hold on to the past
Just wish it could last
'Cause you
Were my first star gazing in a pickup truck
Pick me up and stay out way past curfew
You were my first slow dancin' around the kitchen
Kissing when your mama wasn't home
And I'd do
Anything to live it again
But time ain't going back and life's still got it's living to do
You were my first love and baby tonight
You'll be my first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Ooh I don't wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna leave it all behind
Ooh I don't wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna leave
Leave you behind
'Cause you
Were my first star gazing in a pickup truck
And you were my first slow dance
And I'd do
Anything to live it again
But time ain't going back and life's still got it's living to do
You were my first love and baby tonight
Ooh you were my first love and baby tonight
You'll be my first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Bye
My first goodbye
Bye
