Song Name: Busy
You used to say every Saturday
That you didn't have time for me
Save it for the boys
Oh boy
Needed you to come by
When my dog died
And even though I cried
You were preoccupied and so annoyed
Like I had a choice
And I get it
You had better things to be doin'
Said screw it, aw dang
Now you're askin' me what I'm doin'
Yeah the truth is
I'm busy, doin' nothing at all
Just sitting here staring
At these four walls
I'm busy, lookin' out the window
Watching every blade
Of the green grass grow
I think it's safe to say, yeah
I don't have time today
I ain't got no where to be
So leave a message at the beep yeah
'Cause I'm busy
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I gotta clean my refrigerator
Hell I might get stuck
In an elevator for fun yeah
I might meet someone
(I might meet someone)
And there we go
Play a little bit of bingo
Blow a little bit of money
At the pearl casino
Half drunk
I'm all booked up
I'm busy, doin' nothing at all
Just sitting here staring
At these four walls
I'm busy, lookin' out the window
Watching every blade
Of the green grass grow
I think it's safe to say, yeah
I don't have time today
I ain't got no where to be
So leave a message at the beep yeah
'Cause I'm busy
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
B is for bless your heart
U's for you messed up
S is for don't even start
And honey you know why we're done
And why I'm busy
Doin' nothing at all
Just sitting here staring
At these four walls
I'm busy, lookin' out the window
Watching every blade
Of the green grass grow
I think it's safe to say, yeah
I don't have time today
I ain't got no where to be yeah
So leave a message at the beep
'Cause I'm busy
