Song Name: Donâ€™t You Wanna Know
She's a Westcoast gone Eastcoast
A city girl outta LA
Traded a party in the hills for the back rules
But she don't know a thing about the southern thing, yeah
How much you wanna know?
How much? A city boy ain't never gonna show you this love
Once you get a taste, you can never get enough
It's a better kind of life, so baby trust
Don't you wanna know?
What it feels like in the moonlight
Blowin' stop signs, tryna find where these roads go
Gettin' lost and live kid, kickin' up
Don't you know that sounds nice girl
Yeah, don't that feel right girl?
Yeah, it's my life girl
I show you things you ain't never seen before
Don't you wanna know? (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Don't you wanna know? Yeah
Now let me take you fishin' in the dark
Ain't no need for wishin' on the stars
I know what you're missin'
Let's kiss some more on the truck and get stuck
'Til the sun comes up
Don't you wanna know?
What it feels like in the moonlight
Blowin' stop signs, wanna find where these roads go
Gettin' lost and live kid, kickin' up
Don't you know that sounds nice girl
Don't that feel right girl?
Oh, it's my life girl
Show you things you ain't never seen before
Never seen before
Don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know girl?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know?
Listen
So how you wanna run it 'cause you're talkin' to the game
Talkin' to the game, yeah, you're talkin' to the game
Baby, once you run it, it'll never be the same
It'll never be the same, no
Don't you wanna know?
What it feels like in the moonlight
Blowin' stop signs, tryna find out where these roads go
Gettin' lost and live kid, kickin' up
Don't you know that sounds nice girl
Don't that feel right girl?
Yeah, it's my life girl
I show you things you ain't never seen before
Don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know girl?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know, yeah?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know, yeah?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna know girl?
