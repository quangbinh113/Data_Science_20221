Song Name: Keep on Moving
I got my dog tags and my good luck charm
A new sailor jerry on my right arm
Got a Rand McNalley and a mastercard
Gonna drive and drive till I buy the farm
Cause people gonna say what they gonna say
I'm just gonna do what I been doing
People gonna be who they're gonna be
I'm just gonna keep on moving
Gonna find a little town where the people move slow
Get out of my skin change my clothes
Maybe take a little trip down to Mexico
If I don't come back, well, there you go
Cause people gonna say what they gonna say
I'm just gonna do what I been doing
People gonna be who they're gonna be
I'm just gonna keep on moving on
At the mercy of wherever the wind is blowing on
Nobody gives a damn where I've been or where I'm going
Where I'm going
So it's adios to those who hate
Gonna live and die with the choices I've made
It's my life for heaven's sake
God don't really care either way
Cause people gonna say what they gonna say
I'm just gonna do what I been doing
People gonna be who they're gonna be
I'm just gonna keep on moving
Yeah, people gonna say what they gonna say
I'm just gonna do what I been doing
People gonna be who they're gonna be
I'm just gonna keep on moving on
At the mercy of wherever the wind is blowing on
Nobody gives a damn where I've been or where I'm going
Where I'm going
Got my dog tags and my good luck charm
A new sailor jerry on my right arm
Got a Rand McNalley and a mastercard
Gonna drive and drive till I buy the farm
