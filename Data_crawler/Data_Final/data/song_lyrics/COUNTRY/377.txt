Song Name: As Good As I Once Was
She said I seen you in here before
I said I been here a time or two
She said "Hello my name is Bobby Jo,
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"
I said "Girls..."
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
If you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
"Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand"
I said "Dave..."
I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says "Oh yes, you can"
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was
May not be good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was
