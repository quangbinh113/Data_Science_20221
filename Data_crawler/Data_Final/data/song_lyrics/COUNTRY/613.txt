Song Name: I Do
I've seen the storm clouds in your past
But rest assured 'cause you are safe at home at last
I rescued you, you rescued me
And we're right where we should be
When we're together
I know the questions in your mind
But go ahead them ask me one more time
You'll find the answers still the same
They won't change from day to day
For worse or better
Will I promise to be your best friend?
And am I here until the end?
Can I be sure I have been waiting for you?
And did I say my love is true?
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have, I do
I know that time will disappear
But this love we're building on will always be here
No way that this is sinking sand
On this solid rock we'll stand
Forever
Will I promise to be your best friend?
And am I here until the end?
Can I be sure I have been waiting for you?
And did I say my love is true?
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have, I do
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have,
Oh I will, I am, I can, I have,
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have
I do
