Song Name: ONE BEER (feat. Lauren Alaina & Devin Dawson)
17 in a small town
Weak knees in a CVS
Door locked in the bathroom
What's it gonna be waitin' on that test?
Never thought that they'd be
Puttin' those life plans on the shelf
A couple American babies raisin' one up their self
One beer turns into a lit cigarette burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny what one beer can turn into?
Sesame Street on the TV
A race car rollin' on a cardboard bridge
Crayon stick figure family
Stuck right there, front center on the fridge
Flash back to two pink lines
A whole bunch of prayin' and doubtin'
Felt like the end of the world
Now the world don't spin without 'em
Hey, hey
One beer turns into a lit cigarette burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss into the back of that truck
Just like that everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light but ain't it funny what one beer can turn into?
A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes lust then a shotgun marriage
Six months later, comes a baby in a carriage
You know what y'all, you know what y'all
The whole thing started with some alcohol
The whole thing started with some alcohol
One beer turns into a lit cigarette burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss into the back of that truck
Just like that everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny what one beer can turn into?
A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes lust then a shotgun marriage
Six months later, comes a baby in a carriage
That's not all, that's not all
Here we go again drinkin' alcohol, yeah
