Song Name: Cowpoke
I'm lonesome, but happy
Rich, but I'm broke
And the good Lord knows the reason
I'm just a cowpoke
From Cheyenne to Douglas
The ranges I know
'Cause I drift with the wind
No one cares where I go
I ain't got a dime
In these ol' worn out jeans
So I'll stop eating steak
And I'll go back to beans
I'll pick up a ten spot
In Prescott, I know
Ridin' the broncs
In the big rodeo
Some evening in springtime
A filly I'll find
And I might spend all summer
With her on my mind
But I'll never be branded
And never be broke
I'm a carefree, range-riding
Drifting cowpoke
