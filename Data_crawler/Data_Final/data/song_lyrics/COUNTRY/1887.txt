Song Name: Ain't Enough Cowboy
(Cowboy in me)
We cuss, we fight, get fed up all night long
Every time we wake up, it's the same old song
I got good at sayin' sorry
But we never really mean we're sorry
You'd think by now, that I'd be gone
But there ain't enough cowboy in me
To slip up out of these sheets
Ride off in the sunset to a bar right down the street
Don't pick up when you call, leave it in the dust
Say to hell with it all, but girl, there ain't enough
Cowboy in me
(Cowboy in me, yeah)
Baby, why you gotta love and look so good?
Make it hard for a man to do what he knows he should
Break up 'stead of make-up sex
Hell no 'stead of sayin' yes
Damn, girl, you know I wish I could
But there ain't enough cowboy in me
To slip up out of these sheets
Ride off in the sunset to a bar right down the street
Don't pick up when you call, leave it in the dust
Say to hell with it all, but girl, there ain't enough
Cowboy in me
(Cowboy in me, yeah)
Oughta take this Chevy down a, "Don't come back" road
Let it all go, you already know
That there ain't enough cowboy in me
To slip up out of these sheets
Ride off in the sunset to a bar right down the street
Don't pick up when you call, leave it in the dust
Say to hell with it all, but girl, there ain't enough
Cowboy in me
(Cowboy in me, yeah)
Cowboy in me
Cowboy in me, yeah
Cowboy in me
