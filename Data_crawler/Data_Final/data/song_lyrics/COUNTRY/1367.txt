Song Name: Life Ain't Fair
Down on the midway
The sideshow barkers say
"Step right up, y'all, I got a game you can't lose"
There's a sucker born every minute
Long as the wheel keep on spinnin'
And one day, the hand of fate gonna land right on you
'Cause life is like a carnival ride
And you're watchin' the ground disappear
And you're sayin', "Won't you stop this train
And let me off right here?"
And when everything is upside down
It won't do you no good to despair
Just remember, we're all goin' 'round together
At the life-ain't-fair
Like the red ball in a game of cups
That moves every time you lift one up
Lookin' for love, you chose the wrong one again
They'll fool you once, fool you twice
You rolled a fool's pair of dice
And what you thought was gold is just an old piece of tin
'Cause life is like a carnival ride
And you're watchin' the ground disappear
And you're sayin', "Won't you stop this train
And let me off right here?"
When everything is upside down
It won't do you no good to despair
Just remember, we're all goin' 'round together
At the life-ain't-fair
Just like a funhouse mirror
In a blur goes one more year
And time is one thing your money can't buy
So take your place in the freak show
Let go of things beyond your control
And enjoy the view from that big wheel in the sky
'Cause life is like a carnival ride
And you're watchin' the ground disappear
And you're sayin', "Won't you stop this train
And let me off right here?"
And when everything is upside down
It won't do you no good to despair
Just remember, we're all goin' 'round together
At the life-ain't-fair
Yeah, we've all got our tickets to the life-ain't-fair
'Cause there's something for everyone at the life-ain't-fair
