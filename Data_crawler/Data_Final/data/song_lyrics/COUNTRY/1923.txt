Song Name: Country Anywhere
We could be out downtown or drunk on the beach
A backyard pool or a courtside seat
A big house party or a hometown football game
We could be country in a Maserati or a Chevrolet
Hotel pool or out by the lake
Don't care where I'm at girl if you're right there
Yeah, we could be country anywhere
We could be country anywhere
Go easy
Go easy on me baby going 25
In a 50 with me baby got plenty drive
But I feel alive
On a back road
On a little drive
Go easy girl
Go easy on me baby
No need to complicate it
Go easy on me baby, yeah, yeah
We can go anywhere
Favorite thing about you is you just don't care
Yeah, we can go anywhere
If I'm with you
With you
We could be out downtown or drunk on the beach
A backyard pool or a courtside seat
A big house party or my hometown state fair
Yeah, we could be country anywhere
We could be country anywhere
She hit the local bar 'cause she just like me
No matter where she's Tennessee
I'm always home as long as you're with me
With me
I've been everywhere and it's all the same
Waiting on something that never came
The places change but the faces always stay
The same
We can go anywhere
Favorite thing about you is you just don't care
Yeah, we can go anywhere
If I'm with you
We could be country in a Maserati or a Chevrolet
Hotel pool or out by the lake
Don't care where I'm at girl if you're right there
Yeah, we could be country anywhere
We could be country anywhere
