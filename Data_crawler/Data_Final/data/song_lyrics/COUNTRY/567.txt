Song Name: Take It Easy - 2006 Remaster
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
I've got seven women on my mind:
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me,
One says she's a friend of mine.
Take it easy, take it easy,
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy.
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand,
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy.
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see:
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me.
Come on, baby, don't say maybe.
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me.
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again.
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy.
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
Got a world of trouble on my mind.
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover,
She's so hard to find.
Take it easy, take it easy,
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy.
Come on, baby, don't say maybe.
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me.
Oh, we got it easy,
We oughta take it easy.
