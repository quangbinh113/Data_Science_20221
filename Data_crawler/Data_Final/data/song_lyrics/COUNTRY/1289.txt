Song Name: Gone Too Soon - Acoustic
Every night at twelve o'clock
On the dot, it never fails, you call me up
Talkin' 'bout you had a bad day, so you're pullin' up
So, I pour up a cup of just what you need
'Cause I know what you need
I love it when you wanna sleep at my place
I love it when we dancin' down the hallway
But, when you leave, it puts me in a bad place
Will you stay? Come on, please stay
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye"
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya, I want more of
That moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
You ain't goin' nowhere
My t-shirt, you're still in it
Been on your phone for a minute
Baby, who you kiddin'?
Girl, we're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' from the truth
I know you want me too
So, why do you?
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye"
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya, I want more of
That moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
Yeah, it's gone too soon
Girl, we're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' from the truth
But, we don't have to
So, you don't have to
Come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye"
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya, I want more of
That moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
Ooh yeah
It's gone too soon
Ohh it's gone too soon
We ain't go no where
