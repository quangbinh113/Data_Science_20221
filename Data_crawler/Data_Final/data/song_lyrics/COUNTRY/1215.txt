Song Name: Small Town USA
A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
'Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we we're supposed to live
I wouldn't trade one single day in small town USA
Give me a Saturday night, my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay here in small town USA
Around here people break there backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
And I'm proud to say that I love this place, good ole small town USA
Give me a Saturday night, my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
An old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay, here in small town USA, oh yeah
I wouldn't trade one single day
Proud to say I love this place
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet home Alabama and a six pack of light
An old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay, yeah I'll be okay here in small town USA
Oh yeah, small town USA
