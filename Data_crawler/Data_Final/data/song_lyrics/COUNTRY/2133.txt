Song Name: Gettin' By
Padre's cashing in that overtime
Charcoal grill, Friday night
Styrofoam cooler stocked cold and light
Just gettin' by
Watch his young ones run 'round the yard
On the tail end of a week worked hard
Raise a toast to the stars and a can up to the sky
Ain't rollin' low or flyin' high
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Been in between most all my life
All I ever wanted sittin' by my side
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
If I knew then what I know now
What being a good man is all about
I would've told him I was proud
Just gettin' by
Now we don't hurt for money, ain't short on love
Ain't got it all but we got enough
Bills get paid, mouths get fed
Got a good lovin' woman lying in my bed
Ain't rollin' low or flyin' high
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Been in between most all my life
All I ever wanted layin' by my side
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Raise a toast to the stars, can up to the sky
Just waitin' on the by and by
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Been in between most all my life
All I ever wanted standin' by my side
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Somewhere in the middle just gettin' by
Oh, just gettin' by
