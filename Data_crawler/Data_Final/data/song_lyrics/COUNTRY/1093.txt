Song Name: 23
La-la-la-la-la
You can marry an architect
Build you a house out on the water
That really impresses your father, yeah
And you can find some grown-up friends
Drink some wine in California
But even if you cut it shorter
You'll always have long, blonde hair
You'll always be Memphis queen
You'll always be my first time, in New Orleans
No matter where I go, no matter what I do
I'll never be 23, with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll never be 23 with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly Beach
We'll always have Delta nights
We'll always be in between real love and real life
You can ride the train to work
Straighten out your accent in the city
Like your folks ain't from Mississippi, yeah
You probably got an office view
Wearing those skirts you always hated
Yeah, you're so sophisticated
But I bet you when you drink too much
I bet you think about back then
I really hope you're happy now
I'm really glad I knew you then
No matter where I go, no matter what I do
I'll never be 23, with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll never be 23 with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly Beach
We'll always have Delta nights
We'll always be in between real love and real life, yeah, eh
(You're always from my dreams)
(Last night you came over)
You'll always have your first last name
Standing in that July rain
Telling me your mind has changed
But, in my mind, you're still the same
Long blonde hair (long blonde hair)
You'll always be Memphis queen (Memphis queen)
You'll always be my first time (my first time), in New Orleans (New Orleans)
No matter where I go, no matter what I do
I'll never be 23, with anyone but you (anyone but you)
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee (yeah)
But you'll never be 23 with anyone but me
