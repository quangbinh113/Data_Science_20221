Song Name: Caught Up In You
I never knew there'd come a day

When I'd be saying to you
Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true
Know, don't you know the kind of man I am
Know that I'd never fall in love again
But it's real and the feeling comes shining through
I'm so caught up in you little girl
That I never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby it's true you're the one
Who caught me baby you taught me
How good it could be

It took so long to change my mind
I thought that love was a game
I played around enough to find
No two are ever the same
You made me realize the love I'd miss
So hot love I couldn't quite resist
When it's right the light just comes shining through
I'm so caught up in you little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby it's true you're the one
Who caught me baby you taught me
How good it could be
Fill your days and your nights
No need to ever ask me twice oh no
Whenever you want me
And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away oh no

I can't live without you
I'm so caught up in you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away oh no
I can't live without you
I'm so caught up in you little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby it's true you're the one
Who taught me baby you taught me
How good it could be
Little girl you're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby it's true you're the one
Who's caught me and taught me
You got me so caught up in you
