Song Name: Baby Do
I'm a little left of center
More often wrong than right
When I get on a bender
She leaves on the light
So I can find my way through that front door
It's the little things she does
That makes me want her more
I can be real hard to handle
Whenever I get off my chain
Man I've always been a gamble
But damn she loves to play that game
Not everybody gets me or even wants to
But baby do
I'm stubborn, hard headed
I'm settled in my ways
She's got her own method
Of lovin' me anyway
She knows how to calm me down
When I'm red hot
If I put my foot in my mouth
She just laughs it off
I can be real hard to handle
Whenever I get off my chain
Man I've always been a gamble
But damn she loves to play that game
Not everybody gets me or even wants to
But-but-but baby do
She don't have to be "baby do this or that"
'Cause I don't ever let her even have to ask
I can be real hard to handle
Whenever I get off my chain
Man I've always been a gamble
But damn she loves to play that game
Not everybody gets me or even wants to
No, not everybody gets me or even wants to
But-but-but baby do
Aw, baby do
Baby do
