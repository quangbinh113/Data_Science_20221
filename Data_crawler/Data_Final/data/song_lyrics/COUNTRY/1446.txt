Song Name: Texas Rain
That poor soul, he looks wrecked, puttin' out his last cigarette
I drive off, my damn wheels keep turnin' 'round and 'round in his head
I go off to someone else
He starts thinkin' to himself
When I'm around, I make him sad
When I'm gone, he wishes I'd come back
But I'll never bring enough to quite ease his pain
He says I'm like Texas rain
It's two shots down, a bottle to go
Nowhere left to drown his soul
Except that hole I left in his driveway
With all my tire tracks
I go off to someone else
He starts thinkin' to himself
When I'm around, I make him sad
When I'm gone, he wishes I'd come back
But I'll never bring enough to quite ease his pain
He says I'm like Texas rain
When I'm around, I make him sad
When I'm gone, he wishes I'd come back
But I'll never bring enough to quite ease his pain
He says I'm like Texas rain
Like Texas rain
