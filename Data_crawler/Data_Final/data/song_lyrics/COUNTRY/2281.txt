Song Name: I Saw The Light
I laid a red rose
On your front porch
And wrote 'I love you' on a note
I rang the doorbell
And turned to go
Baby when the curtains moved
I couldn't believe the view
I saw the light in your window tonight
And I saw two shadows holding each other tight
I know the truth
When I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
So take your cheating hands off my red dress
'Cause I ain't wearing this thing for you
I see you clearly now
And your lies too
They say that love is blind
Baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
And I saw two shadows holding each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
Why baby why
Should I listen to you
I cry baby cry
Now I'm walking out the door
They say that love is blind
Well baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
And I saw two shadows holding each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
