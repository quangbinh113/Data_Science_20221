Song Name: Funny Face
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
My whole world's wrapped up in you
When the road I walk seems all uphill
And the colors in my rainbow turn blue
You kiss the tears away
You smile at me and say
"Funny face (Funny face), I love you"
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole world's wrapped up in you
And when I hurt your feelings
As I sometimes do
And I say those mean things
That we know are not true
You forgive my childish way
You hold me close and say
"Funny face (Funny face), I love you"
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole world's wrapped up in you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
