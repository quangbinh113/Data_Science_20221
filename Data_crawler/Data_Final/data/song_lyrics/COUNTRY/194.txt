Song Name: Blown Away
Dry lightnin' cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed, "Blow it down"
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked, whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (blown away)
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people call it taking shelter
She called it, "Sweet revenge"
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away (blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away (blown away)
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked, whiskey-memory blown away (blown away)
Blown away
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past (blown away)
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away (blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away (blown away)
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked, whiskey-memory blown away (blown away)
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
