Song Name: It's Just a Matter of Time
Someday, someway
You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes darling, you're going to need me again
It's just a matter of time
Go on, go on
'Til you've reached the end of the line
'Cause I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time
Someday and someway
Girl, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes darling, I know you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember, in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time
