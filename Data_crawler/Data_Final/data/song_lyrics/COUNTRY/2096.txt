Song Name: Drinkin' My Baby (Off My Mind) - 2009 Remaster
Hey, Bartender
Pop the top on another can
Give me ten dimes
For this dollar in my hand
Turn the knob on the jukebox way up loud
I might drive out the whole damn crowd
But I'm drinking my baby off my mind
Hey, Joe
You're lookin' at me like I was half crazy
But ain't you never
Loved and lost a real special lady
She was a sweet lovin' momma she treated me right
I stepped out on her one to many times
Now I'm drinking my baby off my mind
Drinkin' and thinking about facin' tomorrow
Sinkin', sinkin' in a sea of sorrow
Hey, Bartender
Line 'em up down the bar
I'm gonna try
And wash away all these lovin scars
Now don't worry 'bout me weavin' I'll be alright
Show me the door when you close up tonight
Cause I'm drinking my baby off my mind
No don't you worry about me weaving I'll be alright
Show me the door when you close up tonight
Cause I'm drinking my baby off my mind
Yes I'm drinking my baby off my mind
