Song Name: Dirt Road Down
Midnight Friday night you'd text me
"Dad's asleep, baby, come get me"
A right, a left and I was at your house
One dirt road down
Second we pulled out that driveway
Never rolled one mile on a highway
Never had to talk ya in to a dust cloud
You were dirt road down
(Oo-oo) we were kicked back slow lane dreamin'
(Oo-oo) swear I can still hear you singin'
Lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Smokin' King Woods in a high school truck
Console kiss on a two beer buzz
Lightin' that summer on up
I fell for a girl who loved the world
More than she loved this town
Now it's all of these used to be memories, keepin' me dirt road down
Suitcase packed up in a hard top
Said goodbye to me and this map dot
Girl, I thought I could turn you around
'Fore you'd turn a dirt road down
(Oo-oo) when a flames on fire burnin'
(Oo-oo) it never gets easy learnin'
Lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Smokin' Kenwoods in a high school truck
Console kiss on a two beer buzz
Lightin' that summer on up
I fell for a girl who loved the world
More than she loved this town
I was all of these used to be memories, keepin' me dirt road down
If you're out there but 'round here is better than what you have
There's a dirt road down here that can take us right on back
(I swear I can still hear you singin')
Lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Smokin' Kenwoods in a high school truck
Console kiss on a two beer buzz
Lightin' that summer on up
I fell for a girl who loved the world
More than she loved this town
I was all of these used to be memories, keepin' me dirt road down
