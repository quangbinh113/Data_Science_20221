Song Name: Backroad Song
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop
33's just whistlin' by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down
No one else's around, singin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland
Hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down
Way out of town, singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

The only way today could get better
Girl, what I'm thinkin'
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles we're rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
This is my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
Ooh-ooh-ooh (feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
