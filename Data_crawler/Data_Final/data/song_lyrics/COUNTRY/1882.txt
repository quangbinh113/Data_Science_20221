Song Name: How Do You Love (with Lee Brice & Lindsay Ell)
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
I know sometimes I can say the wrong things
Even when I make mistakes, you love me anyway
And that's why you're my sunshine, darling
Even when it rains, when it rains
I need my little baby by my side
I'll be your Johnny Cash if you walk my line
I'll give you everything for all of your time
And now I just wanna know why
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me how do you love
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
I don't know the way but you've been there before
Been around the town, but ain't no place like home
Take me on the long way
Baby, tell me where to go, where to go
I need my little baby by my side
I'll be your Johnny Cash if you walk my line
I'll give you everything for all of your time
And now I just wanna know why
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me how do you love
Tell me how do you love
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn to give you enough
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn to give you enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me, how do you love?
Tell me, how do you love?
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough
Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough

Ooh, baby, I just wanna learn and give you enough (give you enough)
Tell me, how do you love?
