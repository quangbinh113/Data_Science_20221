Song Name: Farmer's Daughter
Well, I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willing to work
'Til the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said, "I'm your man
I can start right now" and we shook hands
He said, "The fence needs fixin', the peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin' round"
I was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek and it was back to work
In that dead-gum heat
I was cussin' out loud, thinkin' 'bout quittin'
Lookin' back now, I'm sure glad I didn't
'Cause just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught a glimpse of the farmer's daughter
She was just gettin' home from Panama City
She was all tanned-up and my kind of pretty
When her eyes met mine I was thinkin' that
I sure love my job
As the days got shorter, our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up, I was sneakin' her home
And draggin' my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor, she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
And just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter
We got married last spring
Oh, and there ain't no better life for me
I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun's got me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me out a glass of sweet ice tea
Now I'm on the tractor, she's on my mind
And I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
And just when I think it can't get no hotter
I come home to the farmer's daughter, yeah
The farmer's daughter
Hey, baby
