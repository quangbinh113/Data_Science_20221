Song Name: Under My Skin - Stripped
I fell under the spell of your hazel eyes
Now I can't sleep though I've tried
You branded my soul with a touch that's here to stay
Now I'm makin' blue sky memories
You're the one that finally got to me
I tried to resist, but your kiss blew me away
Every fear, every let down
Every painful memory
Fades away when I'm with you
Every high, every low
Every late night drinkin' alone
Swearin' I will never love again
Baby, you got under my skin (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, you for under my skin (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Sittin' pretty like a brand new tattoo
I just sit back and enjoy the view
And it looks like this time, it ain't gonna fade
You went and took a lost and lonely man
Said you're gonna love me to the end
All it took was a lot of prayer and a little faith
Every fear, every let down
Every painful memory
Fades away when I'm with you
Every high, every low
Every late night drinkin' alone
Swearin' I will never love again
Baby, you got under (ooh-ooh)
Baby, you got under (ooh-ooh)
Baby, you got under (ooh-ooh)
And every fear, every let down
Every painful memory
Fades away when I'm with you
And every high, every low
Every late night drinkin' alone
Swearin' I will never love again
Baby, you got under my skin, oh, yes (ooh-ooh)
Baby, you for under my skin (ooh-ooh)
