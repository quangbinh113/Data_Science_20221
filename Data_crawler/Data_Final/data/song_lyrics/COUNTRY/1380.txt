Song Name: House A Home
Baby when you walk in the room
Feel your love fillin' up every corner
Girl when you get in the mood that fire place gets a little warmer
This whole place would crumble without you
This foundation ain't nothin without you
You bring the beautiful out of everything around you
Yeah you do baby
You make this house a home
Baby you make this house a home
It ain't the pictures in the hall
It ain't the roof, it ain't the walls
Baby you make this house a home
Girl you make, girl you make
This house a home
We got married in that backyard
Up until then well it was just a backyard
Looked at you and said my vows
I meant it then and I mean it now
Girl you make this house a home
Baby you make this house a home
It ain't the pictures in the hall
It ain't the roof, it ain't the walls
Baby you make this house a home
You should see what this place looks like when you leave
When you leave
Colours they fade and it gets harder to breathe
Baby you make this house a home
Baby you make this house a home
(Girl you make, girl you make it)
It ain't the pictures in the hall
It ain't the roof, it ain't the walls
Baby you make this house a home
Baby you make this house a home
Girl you make, girl you make, girl you make
This house a home
