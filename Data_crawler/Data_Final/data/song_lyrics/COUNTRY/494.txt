Song Name: That Don't Impress Me Much
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius
You drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Ah-huh, yeah yeah
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall out of place
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah!
You're one of those guys that likes to shine his machine
You'll make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now c'mon, baby, tell me - you must be joking right!
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Oh, now ou think you're cool but have you got the touch?
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Ah-huh, yeah yeah
Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
That don't impress me much
Oh no
That don't impress me much
Oh no
Yeah, woo!
Oh no, alright, alright
You're Tarzan
Captain Kirk maybe?
John Wayne?
Whatever, nuh-uh
That don't impress me much
