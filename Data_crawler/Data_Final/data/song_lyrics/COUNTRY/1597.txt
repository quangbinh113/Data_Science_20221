Song Name: I've Been a Long Time Leaving (But I'll Be a Long Time Gone)
I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin'
But I'll be a long time gone.
Loved you so much I loved you so much
I stayed around when I should've moved along
I've been a long time leaving
But I'll be a long time gone.
Hello highline, hello highway
Here come a big ole semi my way
I stick up my thumb, hear the truck come
Trees goin' by, lookin' like a fly.
On my big legs are my Levi's
Hup, hup, hup, hup.
I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin'
But I'll be a long time gone.

But I'll be a long time gone...
