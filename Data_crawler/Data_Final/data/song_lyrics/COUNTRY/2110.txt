Song Name: What A Difference You've Made In My Life
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine, day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life
What a change you have made in my heart
What a change you have made in my heart
You replaced all the broken parts
Oh, what a change you have made in my heart
Love to me was just a word in a song
That had been way overused
But now I've joined in the singin'
'Cause you've shown me love's true meanin'
That's why I wanna spread the news
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine, day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life (listen to it)
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine, day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made, yeah
What a difference you've made in my life
(Difference you've made in my life)
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine, day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made...
(Go ahead and sing it)
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshin, day and night
(Oh yeah, sing it to me)
What a difference you've made...
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine, day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made...
What a difference you've made in my life
