Song Name: That's What I Love About Sunday
Raymond's in his Sunday best
He's usually up to his chest in oil an' grease
There's the Martin's walkin' in
With that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
An' then we shake the Preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken an' some baked beans
Pick a back yard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday
I stroll to the end of the drive
Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup
It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot
Well it's about time
It's 35 cents off a ground round
Baby, cut that coupon out
What I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of Jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
An' steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday
Oh, yeah
New believers gettin' baptized

Momma's hands raised up high
Havin' a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday
Oh, yeah
What I love about Sunday
Oh, yeah
