Song Name: Drinkin' Problem
One more might, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just 'cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken-hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all
They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call a problem, I call a solution
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
Same old, same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all
They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call a problem, I call a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just a solution
It's a broken-hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problems drinkin' at all
They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call a problem, I call a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
