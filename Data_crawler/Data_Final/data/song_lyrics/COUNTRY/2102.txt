Song Name: Two More Bottles of Wine - 2003 Remaster
We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might have set the West Coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight it just up and put me down
Well, I ain't going to let it bother me today
I've been working and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Well, I'm 16 hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
Well, I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West L.A.
But it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm 16 hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
Well, I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West L.A.
But it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's all right, 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
