Song Name: Workin' Man
Working man begs for his own sweet time
Busting them knuckles for a dollar and a dime
Spending his life on the factory line
Working man
Morning coffee in his steel toe boots
Drink it up, lace 'em up, light that fuse
Ain't stacking nothing but some IOU's
Working man
Can't be late
Can't catch a break
BC Powder cause everything aches
Cold six-pack
End of the day
Working man
Singin' woah
Whatcha gonna do
Woman needs loving and the kids needs shoes
Ain't nothin' left when he pays them dues
Working man
Woah
Where ya gonna turn
Daddy said Son, better listen, better learn
Ain't nobody shelling out no concern for the workin' man
Yeah, I've seen it firsthand
Buddy, just like you
That's why I'm out here singing these blue collar blues
For the working man
Yeah, the working man remembers what he learned in the bible
Devil's gonna play when your hands go idle
Always looking for a shot at the title of the workin' man
Yeah, all that stuff when it hits the fan
Rolls downhill and lands on the working man
Woah
Whatcha gonna do
Woman needs loving and the kids needs shoes
Ain't nothin' left when he pays them dues
Working man
Singin' woah
Where ya gonna turn
Daddy said Son, better listen, better learn
Ain't nobody shelling out no concern for the working man
Yeah, I've seen it firsthand
Buddy, just like you
That's why I'm out here singing these blue collar blues
For the working man
Woah
Where you gonna run
Born here, die here
Get the job done
It's a life passed down
Like an old shotgun
Working man
Singing woah
Whatcha gonna do
Woman needs loving and the kids needs shoes
Ain't nothin' left when he pays them dues
Working man
Singin' woah
Where ya gonna turn
Daddy said Son, better listen, better learn
Ain't nobody shelling out no concern for the working man
Woah
Where ya gonna turn
Woah
Better listen, better learn
Woah
Ain't no concern for the working man
