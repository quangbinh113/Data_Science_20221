Song Name: Excuses
What just happened?
I thought we were on the same road
In the fast lane
Right there on the same page
Then it all changed
And all I heard you say
Was, "It ain't you, it's me
You deserve someone better
So this is how it's gotta be"
But, girl, you ain't seen forever
So I'll just stop you right there
'Cause all I hear
Are excuses
About everything that we had and why we had to lose it
Yeah, some bullshit that you said
'Bout how we fell too fast, too hard
And we'd just break each other's hearts
And all those reasons why you said you had to do it
Sure sound like excuses
Well, how can you stand there
Look me in the eye line and tell me you really care?
You could've saved us both some time and just left me a letter
You could've came up with a couple better
Excuses
About everything that we had and why we had to lose it
Yeah, some bullshit that you said
'Bout how we fell too fast, too hard
And we'd just break each other's hearts
And all those reasons why you said you had to do it
Sure sound like excuses
Oh, you could've said you don't love me no more
You could've said nothin' and just walked out the door
But deep down, girl, we both know the truth is
These are just excuses
These are just excuses
About everything that we had and why we had to lose it
Yeah, some bullshit that you said
'Bout how we fell too fast, too hard
And we'd just break each other's hearts
All the reasons why you said you had to do it
Sure sound like excuses
Yeah, sure sound like excuses
