Song Name: Strange
(Go, one, two)
Coyotes on my left and wolves on my right
Sun keeps shining in the middle of the night
Urban feels suburban, Main Street ain't main, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange
A Lincoln came and a Jefferson went
Money on a Maytag and the thing won't spin
Couple hundred dollars feels more like change, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange
Have a smoke
Buy a round
Get on a jetliner goin' anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance a holе in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane
'Cause timеs like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange
Country don't twang, rock and roll ain't loud
Every elevator only ever goes down
Everybody's looking for a little cheap fame, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange
Have a smoke
Buy a round
Get on a jetliner goin' anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance a hole in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane
'Cause times like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange
Have a smoke
Buy a round
Get on a jetliner goin' anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance some holes in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane
If Monday didn't bring you a grin, that's alright
Pour you up a little something
'Cause tomorrow might
Play a guitar as you're rolling away
Singin' times like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange
Made it strange
Made it strange
