Song Name: Close That Tab
One, two, three, four
Aw, yeah
Well, I see you're back in here with him
Doing everything you said you'd never do again
Same drink, same guy, some hangover
Waiting for you in the morning, yeah
And I'm sure it's something but I don't know what you see
You keep ordering history on repeat
The same mistake you already made
Running up a charge your heart can't afford, yeah
You better close that tab, close that tab
He ain't pouring nothing but a heartache in your glass
Shut it down, send it back
Why you wanna spend another happy hour sad
Everybody and your momma told ya
He's a watered-down vodka soda
So, sign that line, drop his ass
Yeah, baby, close that tab
And start one with me
Yeah, that's right
Aw, yeah
Cut him off, kick him out like it's closing time
Go ahead, tell him that he's banned for life
Say anything you want 'til he's gone
As the salt and the lime
After a shot of Patron
Baby, close that tab, close that tab
He ain't pouring nothing but a heartache in your glass
Shut it down, send it back
Why you wanna spend another happy hour sad
Everybody and your momma told ya
He's a watered-down vodka soda
So, sign that line, drop his ass
Yeah, baby, close that tab
And start one with me
Close that tab, close that tab
But you ain't gotta leave, now
Close that tab, close that tab
Just let me buy you a drink
Aw baby, close that tab, close that tab
He ain't pouring nothing but a heartache in your glass
Shut it down, send that shit back
Why you wanna spend another happy hour sad
Everybody and your momma told ya
He's a watered-down vodka soda
So, sign that line, drop his ass
Yeah, baby, close that tab
And start one with me, yeah
Aw yeah, baby
Start one with me, yeah
Aw, yeah
C'mon and close that tab
Close that tab, ooh
