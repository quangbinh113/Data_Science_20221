Song Name: Carrying Your Love
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
Ay, hop up in this front seat, we gonna ride out
I just filled up this old truck, we gonna drive down
Some old country roads, we headed southbound
We'll stop in every little map dot town
We'll hit the Florida line
See them Georgia pines and them peach trees
Carolina sunshine, sipping sweet tea
Make our way out 'Bama baby, zip on up to Tennessee
Stop at Graceland and Dollywood to see The King and Queen
Yeah, and you know I'm down to ride, girl
Yeah, for the rest of my life, girl
Yeah, what we got is all I need, and
Every day's a dream when I'm carrying your love with me
I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
Ay girl, have you ever been Grand Canyon chasing?
Route 66 riding, desert town, Great Laking
Mount Rushmore chilling, top ten destinations, girl
We can go to places you ain't never dreamed about
From up north and down south, ocean-side lighthouse
When the tide dies down, get married on a beach
White sand and white gown, blue skies and white clouds
Tomorrow ain't promised, all we got is right now
Yeah, and you know I'm down to ride, girl
Yeah, for the rest of my life, girl
Yeah, what we got is all I need, and
Every day's a dream when I'm carrying your love with me
I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
We can stay in this small town where we grew up
Put some roots down, raise some babies up
It don't matter if we stay right here
'Cause no matter where, girl, one thing's clear
I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
