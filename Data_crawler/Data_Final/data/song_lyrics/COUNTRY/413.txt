Song Name: She's Everything
She's a yellow pair of runnin' shoes
A holy pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's "I want a piece of chocolate"
"Take me to a movie"
She's "I can't find a thing to wear"
Now and then she's moody
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowin'
She's a soft place to land
And a good feelin' knowin'
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothin'
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's lovin'
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feelin' kinda tipsy
She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holdin'
When I'm on my knees and prayin'
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playin'
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me
She's the voice I love to hear
And someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rockin' chair
I want rockin' right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah, she's everything to me
Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
And she's everything to me
