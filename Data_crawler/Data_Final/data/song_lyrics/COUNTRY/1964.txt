Song Name: The Only Problem Is
Da-da-da-da-dun
Da-da
Da-da-da-da-dun
Da-da
I just came out for a drink
Honestly, I didn't think
That I'd run into you
It's been a couple months since we been through and
I didn't plan it, no
But, baby, damn it, I
Still feel the chemistry
The subtle, sweet heat of our history
But we tried it (tried it)
Never got the right timin' (timin')
We only ever end up cryin' and lyin'
So, yeah, we better call it a night
The only problem is
Boy, you lookin' better than you ever did
Just when I thought that I was over it
You walk back in and get me fallin' for those eyes
The only problem is
Boy, you always got me like no one did
So when the moment's right, I'll lean in for a kiss
I make a wish that maybe we could get it alright
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Yeah
There was too much emotion
Two sips on the ocean
And, baby, we were goin' down
We had to save ourselves or we both drown
But we tried it (tried it)
Never got the right timin' (timin')
We only ever end up cryin' and lyin'
So, yeah, we better call it a night
The only problem is
Boy, you lookin' better than you ever did
Just when I thought that I was over it
You walk back in and get me fallin' for those eyes
The only problem is
Boy, you always got me like no one did
So when the moment's right, I'll lean in for a kiss
I make a wish that maybe we could get it right
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Uh-uh, yeah (da-da)
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Listen (da-da)
The only problem is
I've never felt somethin' as good as this
We know it's broken and it's something we can't fix
But tell me this, how we supposed to say goodbye?
When the only problem is
Boy, you lookin' better than you ever did
Just when I thought that I was over it
You walk back in and get me fallin' for those eyes
Oh, the only problem is
Boy, you always got me like no one did
So when the moment's right, I'll lean in for a kiss
I make a wish that maybe we could get it right
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Oh, oh yeah
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Yeah, the only problem is (da-da-da-da-da)
Me, baby
The only problem is (da-da-da-da-da), mm-hm
There was too much emotion
Two sips on the ocean, and
Baby, they were goin' down, down
