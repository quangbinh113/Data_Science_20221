Song Name: Burn Me Out
We don't come together, sometimes we leave alone
Barley know each other, but we know how Fridays go
Says she had a boyfriend, she's drinking to forget
Still got a couple habits, she ain't quit just yet
Me and the cigarettes
Yeah, she lights me up
And she pulls me in
In that smoke filled room
For a midnight kiss
That she's bumming when she's lonely and she's needing me right now
I guess I'll let her light me up and breathe me in
Then burn me out
She's touching up her lipstick in the mirror behind the bar
She lets me call her baby
She lets us go to far
But it ain't love were chasing
I'm just another thing
That's she's craving when she's had a couple drinks
Yeah, she lights me up
And she pulls me in
In that smoke filled room
For a midnight kiss
That she's bumming when she's lonely and she's needing me right now
I guess I'll let her light me up and breathe me in
Then burn me out (burn me out)
Burn me out (burn me out)
We didn't come together, but we won't leave alone
Yeah, she lights me up
And she pulls me in
In that smoke filled room
For a midnight kiss
That she's bumming when she's lonely and she's needing me right now
I guess I'll let her light me up and breathe me in
Then burn me out (burn me out)
(Burn me out)
(Burn me out)
Oh yeah, you are right about me, yeah, (burn me out)
Burn me out (burn me out)
Burn me out
