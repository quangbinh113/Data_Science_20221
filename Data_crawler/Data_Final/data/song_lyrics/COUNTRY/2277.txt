Song Name: Do Ya'
Do you still get a thrill
When ya see me comin' up the hill?
Honey, now do ya?
Do ya whisper my name
Just to bring a little comfort to ya? Do ya?
Do ya still like the feel of my body lyin' next to ya?
Well, I guess what I'm askin' do you still love me?
Oh, do you lie awake thinkin'
I'm the biggest mistake you ever made?
Honey, now do ya?
And if just by snappin' your fingers
You could snap them fingers
And make it all go away
Honey, now would ya?
Do ya miss me when I'm gone
But sometimes wish that I'd stay gone
Just a little bit longer?
Well, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do you still love me?
'Cause honey, I sure do still love you
At least I think I do
And these questions I'm askin'
You could ask them of me too
Do you still get a thrill
When ya see me comin' up the hill?
Honey, now do ya?
Do ya whisper my name
Just to bring a little comfort to ya?, Do ya?
Do ya still like the feel of my body lyin' next to ya?
Well, I guess what I'm askin' do you still love me?
Do ya? Oh, do ya?
Tell me, do ya?
