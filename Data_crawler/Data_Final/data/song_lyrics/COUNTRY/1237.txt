Song Name: Better With A Broken Heart - Acoustic Live In Studio
A sunset goes good with a blanket on the hood and someone to red wine kiss
A mornin' was made for pullin' down the shades and let's spend all day just like this
And saying goodbye is always best in the dark
But nothin' goes together when it all falls apart
Like neon burned out with a few whiskeys down
And a sad song in a smoky bar
A long drive alone without anywhere to go
And the rain on the roof of this car
Some things just go better with a broken heart
Don't need to go out with my friends on the town
Or fall into a stranger's bed
That might work for most but for me, it don't come close
I'd rather be alone instead
No, my misery don't need company
Just neon burned out with a few whiskeys down
And a sad song in a smoky bar
A long drive alone without anywhere to go
And the rain on the roof of this car
Some things just go better with a broken heart
It's a match made in heaven when it hurts like hell
And nothin' goes together like all by myself (all by myself)
And neon burned out with a few whiskeys down
And a sad song in a smoky bar
A long drive alone without anywhere to go
And the rain on the roof of this car
Some things just go better with a broken heart
Oh, some things just go better with a broken heart
