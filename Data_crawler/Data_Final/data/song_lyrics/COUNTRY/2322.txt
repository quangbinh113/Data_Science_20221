Song Name: Sound of the South
Got a tattoo on the back of my mind
You burned it there last Saturday night
Had a bed in the bed of my truck, moonshine to kill
Made love like rain on red hot steel
And we're gettin' down all night long
With all of them crickets singin' little love songs
South Georgia wind runnin' over our skin
Had the radio down on low
Listen to the creek rollin' by real slow
And when the sun came around, we were still gettin' down
To the sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
The sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
Both high buzzin' like a fire fly
Lightin' up the midnight sky
Had the stars wrappin' us up and all I could hear
Was the sound of you whisperin' in my ear
And gettin' down all night long
With all of them crickets singin' little love songs
South Georgia wind runnin' over our skin
Had the radio down on low
Listen to the creek rollin' by real slow
And when the sun came around, we were still gettin' down
To the sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
The sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
Gettin' down, down, down
To the sound, sound, sound
Gettin' down, down, down
To the sound, sound, sound
Gettin' down, down, down
To the sound, sound, sound
Gettin' down, down, down
To the sound
Gettin' down all night long
All of them crickets singin' little love songs
South Georgia wind runnin' over our skin
Had the radio down on low
Listen to the creek rollin' by real slow
And when the sun came around, we were still gettin' down, yeah
When that sun came around, we were still gettin' down
To the sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
The sound of the South, woah, woah-oh
