Song Name: Gentleman
(Heads up, heads up)
(May or may not be sober)
(All the lights)
(You don't want to be a gentleman)
You got that Southern charm
You got that take me out and wear me on your arm
You get the tab, you get the door
They don't make 'em like you anymore
You know I love that about you
I wouldn't change a thing about you
But I'm in a mood, what can I say?
I really hope you're on your way
Just a heads-up for when you come over
May or may not be sober
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
You can still kiss me, slow as you like
You've always been the type to take your time
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
Tonight
I don't mind
No, I don't mind
No, I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
You can still drop the needle down
Pour out some red and spin me 'round
But when you close the door and close the blinds
No, you don't gotta be the nice guy
Just a heads-up for when you come over
May or may not be sober
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
You can still kiss me, slow as you like
You've always been the type to take your time
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman tonight
Just a heads-up for when you come over
May or may not be sober
Turn off all the lights
Boy, you know I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
You can still kiss me, slow as you like
You've always been the type to take your time
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman
Tonight
I don't mind
Turn off all the lights, might not be ladylike
I'm just saying I don't mind
If you don't wanna be a gentleman tonight
