Song Name: I Didn't Think About Rain
I built my house in a valley, to escape the winter wind
I knew the heat was something, that goes when the season ends
I coulda stayed up high on a mountain side, made it through the days
But I laid it low in a flood zone, cause I didn't think about rain
When you left me, I never saw it coming
A bad ending to a movie I was loving
Oh every which way, the weather and the pain
I thought I played it safe, but I didn't think about rain
I guess I've grown to trust myself cause of all that pride
But then the obvious hits me with surprise
I may think I'm smart doing what I should, but the worst part is you broke me good
I expected everything, except for one thing
When you left me, I never saw it coming
A bad ending to a movie I was loving
Oh every which way, the weather and the pain
I thought I played it safe, but I didn't think about rain
I didn't think about rain
I'm here praying for a break in the clouds
And I'm hoping that this heart don't drown
This heart don't drown
When you left me, I never saw it coming
A shitty ending to a movie I was loving
Oh every which way, the weather and the pain
I thought I played it safe
I thought I played it safe, but I didn't think about rain
No I didn't think about rain
