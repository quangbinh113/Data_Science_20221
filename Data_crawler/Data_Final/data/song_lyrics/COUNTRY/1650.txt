Song Name: Up To No Good
(Mmm-mmm)
People talkin', all my friends
Textin', callin' all weekend
"Why I ain't seen you around?
What's-her-name tyin' you down"
I don't care 'cause they don't know
That fire she lights that takes me over
I'm goin' out of my mind
Wrong never felt so right
She's keepin' me up, up, up, up to no good
Up all night 'til the day come
She's hell on heels, one look and I'm hooked
On the one mama said stay away from
She'll burn a hole right through me
There ain't no turnin' back now
She's keepin' me up, up, up
Takin' me down, down, down
(Up, up, up, mmm-mmm)
Like a devil on my shoulder
She's the drug I can't say no to
Know it ain't good for me
Man, I'm lovin' how she's
She's keepin' me up, up, up, up to no good
Up all night 'til the day come
She's hell on heels, one look and I'm hooked
On the one mama said stay away from
She'll burn a hole right through me
There ain't no turnin' back now
She's keepin' me up, up, up
Takin' me down, down, down
Yeah, mmm-mmm
Up, up, up
Up, up, up, mmm-mmm
She's keepin' me up, up, up, up to no good
Up all night 'til the day come
She's hell on heels, one look and I'm hooked
On the one mama said stay away from
She'll burn a hole right through me
There ain't no turnin' back now
She's keepin' me up, up, up
Takin' me down, down, down
