Song Name: First High
I got a car and it takes unleaded
I know a place with a tab on credit
So I fill the tank and get some Cokes for my friends
Lord, it's good to be back home again
It feels crazy runnin' down these roads
When I see the street sign, my mind always goes
Back to the old days of '94
They don't make 'em like that anymore
Oh, take me back to the first dream
501 blue jeans
Tighter than goddamn Springsteen
Take me back to the first show
Right back to the first note
When I knew my heart was pure rock 'n' roll
I'm still searchin' for that first high

I tried cheerin' for the wolverines
I took a shot at being pageant queen
But I wound up hangin' with the punks at the park
Somebody asked me if had a spark
I played it cool but I was unsteady
My mind was reelin', man, it was so heavy
But I laid back and I let it ride
Oh, the first taste of paradise
Oh, take me back to the first dream
501 blue jeans
Tighter than goddamn Springsteen
Take me back to the first kiss
Oh, how I miss how I felt when I fell for the first time
I'm still searchin' for that first high
Yeah, I'm still searchin' for that first high
Sometimes I think that I should take a ride
Hundred miles an hour with no headlights
Then I might feel the same way I did back then
Never gonna happen again
Oh, take me back to the first dream
501 blue jeans
Tighter than goddamn Springsteen
Take me back to the first night
Back to the first ride
When there was nothin' but the first time
I'm still searchin'
Yeah, I'm still searchin'
Yeah, I'm still searchin' for that first high
Yeah, I'm still searchin' for that first high
