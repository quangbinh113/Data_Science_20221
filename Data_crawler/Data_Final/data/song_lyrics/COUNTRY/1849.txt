Song Name: April Showers
They say April showers bring May flowers
But it's been dry as hell
A four leaf clover can bring you closer
To luck than pennies in a well
Well, I've been waiting on a shooting star
But ain't a damn one of 'em fell
And if it does, I'll be too crossed up to even tell
And it's weird
We don't talk like we used to and I'm so scared
Of what we've become
Is this time the last time that we'll be together?
Fuck this April weather, goodbye
Well, you could holler that you're sorry
But that don't mean a thing
Because the whiskey words never cured the hurt
And your tears are the only rain that I've seen
It's weird
We don't talk like we used to and I'm so scared
Of what we've become
Is this time the last time that we'll be together?
Fuck this April weather, goodbye
Goodbye
And it's weird
We don't talk like we used to and I'm so scared
Of what we've become
Is this time the last time that we'll be together?
Fuck this April weather, goodbye
Bye
