Song Name: Forever
Well, I left town with a chip on my shoulder
Toting 27 dollars worth of cheap cocaine
Well, down another hour just outside of Tyler
And a lightin' storm with lots of rain
Hitch hike me a ride with my future ex-wife
Hell, I told her that when I got in
She said, "Just love me tonight, we'll forget about the ride"
And then her mumble turned into a scream
She said, "Oh baby, come on
I'll be gone in the morning by the time you wake up
If you want, I can just stay with you forever"
So I did what I wanted to, not what I needed to
Now I'm addicted to a love that's gone wrong
And it's my fault, I'm so alone
They say she did and she'll leave and when she's gone
All you're left with is bad memories
And a drug that won't fix all your mistakes
You'll lay on your knees and say
Oh baby, come on
I'll be gone in the morning by the time you wake up
If you want, I can just stay with you forever
She said, "Oh baby, come on
I'll be gone in the morning by the time you wake up
If you want"
She said, "Oh baby, come on
I'll be gone in the morning by the time you wake up
If you want, oh, I can just stay with you forever"
She said, "Oh baby, come on
I'll be gone in the morning by the time you wake up
If you want"
Well, I left town with a chip on my shoulder
Toting 27 dollars worth of cheap cocaine
