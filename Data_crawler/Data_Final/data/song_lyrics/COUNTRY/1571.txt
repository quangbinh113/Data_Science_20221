Song Name: I'm Just a Clown
Circus is comin' through
Everybody knows
That when you purchase a ticket
You expect to get a show
Aw, take a look at me, I'm just a clown
And on my face, I wear a frown
I've paid the cost to hang around
So take a look at me, I'm just a clown
The joker stands in the middle
And turns a trick for you
Because sometimes you know it's better
To be thought of as a fool
Aw, take a look at me, I'm just a clown
And on my face, I wear a frown
I've paid the cost to hang around
So take a look at me, I'm just a clown
I'm just a clown, that's what they say
I guess my clothes give me away
All of my friends have disappeared
You know it makes me wonder if I was ever here
Take a look at me, I'm just a clown
And on my face, I wear a frown
I've paid the cost to hang around
So take a look at me, I'm just a clown
I'm just a clown, take a look at me
I'm so lonesome, I should charge a fee
I guess my clothes give me away
I'm just a clown, that's what they say
I'm just a clown
