Song Name: The Lost Years
Out of thin air
Straight up in smoke
Where they went
Maybe I'll never know
2009 staring me in the mirror
And will I ever be happy again?
The lies you told
Were sweeter than your kiss
Just like giving candy
To a kid
I laughed along I didn't know I was the joke
And will I ever be happy again?
I lost my way
I lost my soul
I lost too much weight
I lost all control
I lost some friends
I lost you my dear
But when people ask
I just say I lost years
The lost years
Hiding behind
Tequila and cigarettes
Wearing a smile
Of shame and regret
Apologizing for things I didn't do
And will I ever be happy again?
I lost my way
I lost my soul
I lost too much weight
I lost all control
I lost some friends
I lost you my dear
But when people ask
I just say I lost years
The lost years
Time I'll never get back
Yeah, I have to live with that
Will I ever be happy again?
I lost my way
I lost my soul
I lost too much weight
I lost all control
I lost some friends
I lost you my dear
But when people ask
I just say I lost years
I lost my way
I lost my soul
I lost too much weight
I lost all control
I lost some friends
I lost you my dear
But when people ask
I just say I lost years
The lost years
