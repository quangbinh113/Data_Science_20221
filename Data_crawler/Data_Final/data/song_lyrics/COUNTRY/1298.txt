Song Name: Using Again
I'm living low down and I am using again
I'm hating my name 'cause I'm cursed like my kin
And if I should see you before I'm condemned
I hope you're deceived by the webs that I spin
And I wish I was who I appear
'Cause I despise the man in the mirror
Lost deep inside of my dirty old soul
Some starry-eyed boy never taught self control
The cost of my living was more than I planned
So I held the needle like a gun in my hand
And I wish I was who I appear
'Cause I despise the man in the mirror
The memories I've got torture my head
And I don't know God but I heard he was dead
And if I am wrong and in judgement I stand
I will not repent 'cause I don't give a damn
You can send me to Hell with the rest of my friends
And I wish I was who I appear
'Cause I despise the man in the mirror
I'm living low down and I am using again
