Song Name: Sunroof (feat. Thomas Rhett)
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
Aw, yeah
Feels like a never-ending summer with you
And surfing after winter in the middle of June
Sunset, sunroof, suntan on you
Blue skies, green eyes it feels like I'm
Driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
Yeah, I'm feeling like this might be my time with you
With you, with you
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
I got my head out the sunroof
Oh-ooh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-ooh
You got me stuck on the thought of you
Oh-ooh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-ooh
Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind (you got me stuck on the thought of you)
I'm feeling like this might be my time to shine with you
With you, with you
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da
