Song Name: All On Me - Recorded at Spotify Studios NYC
Yeah, I know that the woes and the weight of the world can get in side our minds
And be too much sometimes, yeah I know
But baby don't let the no's and the ups and the downs from the rollercoaster ride
Beat you up inside, oh baby don't
But if you ever feel that way, don't you ever hesitate, 'cause
You got my number you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Settle in, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy, put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Yeah, put it all on me
I wanna take you out on the town on my dime anytime, tell me when you're free
We can do anything and everything you want, yeah
Oh, I wanna hear all your fears and your troubles
Strip it down, really get to know one another
When it's nobody but you and me, just us
Girl you know I'm here for you
You can lean on me anytime you need to
You got my number, you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Settle in, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Yeah, put it all on me
Hm-mm alright, put it all on, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon relax your mind on me
When you need a shoulder you can cry on me
Baby you can bet your life on me
And put it all on me
You got my number, you can call on me (call on me)
If you're in trouble put the fall on me (fall on me)
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me (high on me)
Make it slow take your time on me (time on me)
Settle in, let it out
Come and lay on me
Yeah, when it gets heavy put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Yeah, baby put it all on me
Put it all on me
Put it all on me, baby
Alright
