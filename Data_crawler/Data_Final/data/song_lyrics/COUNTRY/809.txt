Song Name: Ran into You
Street bike
Road signs
Highways
Coastlines
Neon signs and keys to cheap motels
It was a new place
Same song
Can't stay
Too long
Pack it on up and off to somewhere else
I ran like hell to nowhere fast
From myself
From my past
From my hometown and everyone I ever knew
I ran from God when he got too close
I ran from love and the hearts I broke
And from all the wreckage I left in my rear-view
All I ever knew was running
'Til I ran into you
Your town
That night
Right bar
Right time
I hung on every word your sweet voice said
Turned a few days, a few weeks
Into no way
Can't leave
You put this restless heart of mine to rest
I ran like hell to nowhere fast
From myself
From my past
From my hometown and everyone I ever knew
I ran from God when he got too close
I ran from love and the hearts I broke
And from all the wreckage I left in my rear-view
All I ever knew was running
'Til I ran into you
I ran from God when he got too close
I ran from love and the hearts I broke
And from all the wreckage I left in my rear-view
All I ever knew was running
All I ever knew was running
All I ever knew was running
'Til I ran into you
