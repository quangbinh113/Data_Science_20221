Song Name: Devil Always Made Me Think Twice
I take a little smoke in the evening
I take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind killin' my mind
It's just the kind of things I like
Just the kind of things I like
The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I figured I was diggin' my grave
And you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave
And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think
Someday I'm goin' six feet under
And when they got me standin' at the gate
They'll tally my sins, they won't let me in
Saying, "Son, you're just a little too late"
"Son, you're just a little too late"
And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me
Devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me
Devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice
