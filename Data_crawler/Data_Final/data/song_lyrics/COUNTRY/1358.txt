Song Name: Bout Damn Time
The catfish cookers
The farm tan crew
The hicks and the lip-spittin' redman chew
If that sounds anything like you
Raise 'em up
Yeah, raise 'em up
Yeah the truck bed lookers
The cornfed hips
The ball cap boys with a six-inch lift
If that's something you can identify with
Raise 'em up
Yeah raise 'em up
It's a cold hard fact that we can't ignore
Country music ain't country no more
It's about damn time
Somebody sang a little something like this
A hippy rockstar, hillbilly from the sticks
Turning up a fifth
Chug, chug, chug
Till we all half-lit
It's about damn time
We threw a party on the radio waves
Singing what we live
Cause it's all we know to say
There ain't been a song
For the hey-y'all outlaw down home kind and
It's about damn time
If you a barbed-wire hanger
A truck-tire sinker
A fire-water drinker till your thinker gets heavy
If you're sitting in your John Deere more than your Chevy
Turn it up, y'all don't get enough credit
It's about damn time
Somebody sang a little something like this
A hippy rockstar, hillbilly from the sticks
Turning up a fifth
Chug, chug, chug till we all half-lit
It's about damn time
We threw a party on the radio waves
Singing what we live
Cause it's all we know or say
There ain't been a song
For the hey-y'all outlaw down home kind and
It's about damn time
It's about damn time
Woah, woah
From side to side
From the back to the front
Oh, Oh
Y'all sing it at the top of your lungs
It's about damn time
It's about damn time
Somebody sang a little something like this
A hippy rockstar, hillbilly from the sticks
Turning up a fifth
Chug, chug, chug till we all half-lit
It's about damn time
We threw a party on the radio waves
Singing what we live
Cause it's all we know or say
There ain't been a song
For the hey-y'all outlaw down home kind
It's about damn time
Woah, woah
It's about damn time
Damn time
It's about damn time
