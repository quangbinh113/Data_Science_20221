Song Name: Dust
First time I saw you
You were sitting on a bench
Pining like a flower
Growing in a ditch
Wheels were set in motion
Losing all control
Making love like diamonds
Making words like gold
There's nothing I could tell you
There's nothing I could say
Really was the sweetest thing
Ever come this way
Last thing I remember
I fell asleep on a bus
Dreamt the world was falling and
Turning into dust
Moonlights all around me
There's nothing left to use
Who will stick around now?
Ain't something I can choose
Some stories have no endings
Some things never die
Really was the sweetest thing
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
Sometimes I look in the mirror
I can see your face
Guess there's a piece of you now
Living in this place
Cutting hair in a truck stop sink
Red eyes, I can barely think
New name and some cheap wine
I'll take it anytime
Some stories have no endings
Some things never die
Really was the sweetest thing
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
To ever pass me by
