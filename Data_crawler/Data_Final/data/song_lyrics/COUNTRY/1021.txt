Song Name: Let Your Love Flow
There's a reason for the sunshine in the sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season
When that love light shines all around us
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling, where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean, it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean, that's the reason
There's a reason for the warm, sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season
When those love lights shine all around us
So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under it's loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean, it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean, that's the reason
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean, it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean, that's the reason
