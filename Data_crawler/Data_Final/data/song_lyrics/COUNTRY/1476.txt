Song Name: Wasn't That Drunk (feat. Carly Pearce)
Small Talking
Old friends
Catching up on how have you been
That smile
I missed
Damn it's good to see you again
I bought you a drink and I asked you to dance,
After a couple more rounds you were holding my hand
Next think I know, we were closing it down
Sharing a cab back to your house.
I know we were laughing, saying what ever happened
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up.
If you're thinking, it's because we were drinking
Well that don't mean that it don't mean much.
Cause it did... and it does
Cause the truth of it is... I wasn't that drunk.
I was tipsy
When you kissed me
But that aint why I kissed you back
I'll be honest
I've wanted
To do that, to do that, do that
Ohh so long and ohh so bad
Then last night it happened so fast
And I'd do it over
I wouldn't think twice
Cause Laying here sober it still feels right
I know we were laughing, saying what ever happened
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up.
If you're thinking, it's because we were drinking
Well that don't mean that it don't mean much.
Cause it did... and it does
Cause the truth of it is... I wasn't that drunk.
I want you to know it
Wasn't just the heat of the moment
I know we were laughing, saying what ever happened
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up.
If you're thinking, it's because we were drinking
Well that don't mean that it don't mean much.
Cause it did... and it does
Cause the truth of it is... I wasn't that drunk.
