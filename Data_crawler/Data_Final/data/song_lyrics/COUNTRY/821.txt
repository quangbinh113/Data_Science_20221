Song Name: Christmas Time's a Comin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home!
Snow flakes a-fallin',
My old heart's a-callin',
Tall pines a-hummin' --
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, don'tcha hear them singin'?
When it's snowin', I'll be goin'
Back to my country home.
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home!
Bright candles burnin',
My old heart's a-yearnin'
For the folks at home when
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.
Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, don'tcha hear them singin'?
When it's snowin', I'll be goin'
Back to my country home.
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home!
Holly's in the window,
Home's where the wind blows.
[B]Can't walk for runnin' [/b]--
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.
Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, don'tcha hear them singin'?
When it's snowin', I'll be goin'
Back to my country home.
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'!
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home!
