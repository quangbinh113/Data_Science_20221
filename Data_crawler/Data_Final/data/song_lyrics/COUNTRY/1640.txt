Song Name: God Bless This Mess - Reimagined (feat. Lucius)
Here's to the brokens
The misfits and wannabes
The part of you that's just like me
The wildflowers and the "Holier than thou's"
The diamonds that are never gonna leave the rough
The rolling stones that are always stuck
The all nighter's and the lost I've never found
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the gooder part
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess
Here's to the waiting
All the waiting that we have to do
The dreams we make that never come true
And all the hurting that comes without warning
Here's to the view from the tile of the bathroom floor
Ain't we all been there before?
And the hell bent Sun that's gonna come up the next morning
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the gooder part
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess
Most the time I forget to pray
But when I close my eyes, I just say
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the gooder part
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
Oh God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess
