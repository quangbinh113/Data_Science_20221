Song Name: Story to Tell
I wanna stand on the edge of the Rio Grande
Drive cross-country in a Black Trans Am
Make a few friends in every town
In little dive bars that never shut down
Drink from a bottle on the coast of France
Start a flashmob even though I can't dance
Walk a red carpet like a movie star
Win a hundred dollars on a hand of cards
And I don't wanna look back
Lookin' on now wishin' I would've done that
'Cause some people spend their whole life saving up
'Cause the number in the bank's never high enough
Some wanna see the whole world the whole way around
Without a single root running through the ground
Some people work away what they got left
More years on the high now they don't gotta have, no I
I need for myself
Is a damn good story to tell
I wanna get married in a chapel in the middle of Vegas
Jump on a plane and see where it takes us
Let people talk 'cause we don't care
We're rich on love like billionaires
Some people spend their whole life saving up
'Cause the number in the bank's never high enough
Some wanna see the whole world the whole way around
Without a single root running through the ground
Some people work away what they got left
More years on the high now they don't gotta have, no I
I need for myself
Is a damn good story to tell
Ooh-ooh-ooh
So, I guess you can say I'm still writing
My pages ain't filled and the ink ain't drying out
Still got a damn good story to tell
'Cause some people spend their whole life saving up
'Cause the number in the bank's never high enough
They wanna see the whole world the whole way around
Still planting root running through the ground
Some people work away what they got left
More years on the high now they don't gotta have, no I
I need for myself
Is a damn good story
A damn good story
A damn good story to tell
