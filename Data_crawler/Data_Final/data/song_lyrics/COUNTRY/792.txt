Song Name: Before I Knew It
Yeah, I used to be the guy that talked about the guy
I've been turnin' into, ever since I met you
But I ain't gonna lie, kinda like this table for two
With you
Yeah, I was driftin' round from town to town
Wasn't ever gonna settle for the settlin' down
But you turned that around, saw a side of me I never knew
Yeah, it's true
Before I knew it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl, I gotta say this
Whole love thing, I thought I'd never do it
But that's before I knew it, that's before I knew it
Now, I ain't missing those lonely nights
I found myself another keepin' kind
Blonde hair, blue eyes, out of the blue
I never saw it comin'
Before I knew it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl I gotta say this
Whole love thing, I thought I'd never do it
But that's before I knew it, that's before I knew it
Before I knew I was talkin' 'bout a ring
Talkin' 'bout a house
Thinkin' 'bout things that I never thought about
Who would have knew it?
Before I knew it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl, I gotta say this
Whole love thing, I thought I'd never do it
But that's before I knew it, that's before I knew it
Before I knew it
Oh, this whole love thing
Before I knew it
