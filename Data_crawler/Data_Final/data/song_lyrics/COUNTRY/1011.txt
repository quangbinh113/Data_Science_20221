Song Name: Pretty Hands
Oh, pretty hands
Oh, pretty hands
Dirty nails
Weddin' band
Dirty nails
Weddin' band
Oh, dark eyes
Oh, dark eyes
You're runnin' late
It's no surprise
You're runnin' late
No surprise
Mmmh
And your heart is like a city
And I get lost there from time to time
And my heart
Is like a small town
You know, most of the best of parts
Are hard to find
Woah, pretty hands
Oh, pretty hands
Dirty nails
Weddin' band
Dirty nails
