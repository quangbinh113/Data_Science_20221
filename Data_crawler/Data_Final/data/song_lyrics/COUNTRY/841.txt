Song Name: How Do I Wrap My Heart Up for Christmas
Silver bells are ringing
Carolers are singing
Snowflakes drifting through the air
Everybody's shopping
Got no time for stopping
It looks like Christmas is here
So tell me
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas?
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your lovin' arms will have to do
At first I thought of giving you a pretty diamond ring
Wore myself out shopping for a million other things
Finally decided on something you can't buy
But how will I disguise it so you will be surprised?
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas?
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do
A gift of love was given to the world so long ago
Lying in a manger he was wrapped in swaddling clothes
And every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above
And give to one another our little gifts of love
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas?
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do
