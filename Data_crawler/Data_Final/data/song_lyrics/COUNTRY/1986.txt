(John)
(T-T-Tyler mighta did sumn)
Yeah, we all shoulder to shoulder
And we keep gettin' older, yeah
I don't want this night to leave
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, spend it all on Tito's and weed
So put your hands up, we gon' party for life
And we gon' get drunk in the mountains tonight
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, baby, save a shot for me
Yeah, whoa, said we would take it slow
Now she all on go, and this night outta control
Baby, we said we won't, but we both know we will
My cup, it gon' refill, party all night on the hill
Yeah, we drivin' with that top down, baby, this is our town
Feelin' like it's just you and me
Yeah, so we gon' shut the night down, nothing like the right now
I don't want this night to leave
Yeah, we all shoulder to shoulder
And we keep gettin' older, yeah
I don't want this night to leave
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, spend it all on Tito's and weed
So put your hands up, we gon' party for life
And we gon' get drunk in the mountains tonight
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, baby, save a shot for me
It's all a faded memory 'cause we were always drinkin'
I need to slow it down, off the liquor I get dangerous
Young, dumb, wild and free
Her favorite perfume was a smell of her weed
Cheap shots, these rounds are gettin' stronger (yeah)
I need Tylenol, can't take this any longer
Yeah, we all shoulder to shoulder
And we keep gettin' older, yeah
I don't want this night to leave
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, spend it all on Tito's and weed
So put your hands up, we gon' party for life
And we gon' get drunk in the mountains tonight
She a lil' high roller, go to Colorado Boulder
Yeah, baby, save a shot for me
