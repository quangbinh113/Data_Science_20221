Song Name: I Can Help
If you've got a problem, don't care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothing new
But a woman like you, babe, should never have the blues
Let me help, I've got two for me, let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, I can do anything at all
Let me help if your child needs a Dad, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help, for a child needs a Dad, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
