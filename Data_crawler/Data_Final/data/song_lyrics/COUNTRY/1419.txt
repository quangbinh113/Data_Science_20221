Song Name: Marry You
Think we drank every beer in Nashville
And that note that you wrote me I have still
Yeah, it's insane that we're insynced
To have made it all this time and
Now you got me, baby, diamonds or twine
Took forever and a day, but the day has come
Only seven billion people, and you're the one
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
Yeah, I do (give it up to you badly)
Yeah, I do (for as long as you'll have me)
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
I'm a wreck, but you love me all the same
And I love that it ain't 'bout the last name
It's the counterpart to everything that I just couldn't say, yeah
I think you're perfect in every way
Took forever and a day, but the day has come
Only seven billion people, and you're the one
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
Yeah, I do (give it up to you badly)
Yeah, I do (for as long as you'll have me)
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
Took forever and a day, but the day has come
Only seven billion people, and you're the one
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
Yeah, I do (give it up to you badly)
Yeah, I do (for as long as you'll have me)
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
Ain't been drinking, but I mean it
Baby, it's the truth
Yeah, I, I think I kinda wanna marry you
