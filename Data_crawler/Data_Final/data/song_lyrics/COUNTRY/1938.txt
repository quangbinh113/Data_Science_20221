Song Name: Eat Pray Drugs
Jesus, Reese's Pieces
And a brown bag of none of your business
Flea market boiled peanuts
Styrofoam cup of the shells between us
Hot damn, hot lunch
After Sunday service, there's a potluck
Roll one, roll up
Higher than a choir hallelujah
Only three things to do 'round here
Ain't a honey hole or a movie theater
Country is as country does
Eat, pray, drugs
Hose clamp and a 80 mg
Baptist church and a Dairy Queen
We just doin' what we love
Eat, pray, drugs
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Becky dropped out, graduatеd to the needle
Population 'bout to drop a couple pеople
Damn, guess I'll see ya at the funeral
Only three things to do 'round here
Ain't a honey hole or a movie theater
Country is as country does
Eat, pray, drugs
Hose clamp and a 80 mg
Baptist church and a Dairy Queen
We just doin' what we love
Eat, pray, drugs
Ain't even a swing on the swing set
Video store still got VHS
We can't fish and we can't bowl
Just crumble up some crackers on a casserole (eat, pray, drugs)
Ain't even a swing on the swing set
Video store still got VHS
We can't fish and we can't bowl
Just crumble up some crackers on a casserole (eat, pray, drugs)
Ain't even a swing on the swing set
Video store still got VHS
We can't fish and we can't bowl
Just crumble up some crackers on a casserole (eat, pray, drugs)
Crumble up some crackers on a casserole
