Song Name: Pretty Heart
I didn't think I was a bad guy
I knew that you were good
You were golden on the inside
And you loved me the best you could
I'm the one who dropped the ball
Got you high and let you fall
Let the best thing I ever had slip away
What does that say about me?
I could do you like I did
That I can break an angels wings
What does that say about me?
That I stood there like a fence post
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me?
Now that I've broke
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
I been drinking like a drunkard
In these Austin neon lights
Burning smokes and wondering
If there's anything I've done right
Well, I wished that I could go back
Hang on to what I had
Guess that's all, babe
Nothing but a dream
What does that say about me?
I could do you like I did
That I can break an angels wings
What does that say about me?
That I stood there like a fence post
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me?
Now that I've broke
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
What does that say about me?
I could do you like I did
That I can break an angels wings
What does that say about me?
That I stood there like a fence post
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me?
Now that I've broke
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
