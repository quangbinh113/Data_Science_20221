Song Name: Kiss Somebody
Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't gonna bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yeah we've all felt like that
If it's somethin' that you gotta get over
But you just can't get over
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishin' you were with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closin' time
If you wanna kiss somebody, baby I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they'll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
It makes you feel the way you thought you'd never feel again
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishin' you will with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closin' time
If you wanna kiss somebody, baby I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you, yeah
Oh girl who's this boy?

The best friend of Dee's
Girl meets boy
Girl don't make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know what you're goin' through, I do
So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishin' you will with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closin' time
If you wanna kiss somebody, baby I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too (kiss somebody) Kiss somebody like you. (Kiss somebody) I wanna kiss somebody lke you (Kiss somebody)
I wanna kiss somebody
