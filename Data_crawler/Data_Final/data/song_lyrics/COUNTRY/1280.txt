Song Name: Come Back To Bed (Acoustic)
It started with some off time
Dancing in the kitchen led to red wine, painted on your lips
And taking my time kissin' it off
Trail of clothes down the hall led to all night long, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't let sun coming up tell us what we gonna do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl you know that I ain't done loving you
So come back to bed, baby, don't leave
If I said I need your body, would you hold it against me?
Don't open the blinds, let's hit rewind
Take our time re-living every single minute of last night
These two hands, left a lot unsaid
If you ain't out the door then it ain't over yet
So baby come back to bed
Come back to bed
I love the way my t-shirt is fallin' off your shoulder
And these sheets girl, they're only getting colder
Instead of picking out a dress that won't do ya justice
How 'bout you slip into nothin' and just
Come back to bed, baby, don't leave
If I said I need your body, would you hold it against me?
Don't open the blinds, let's hit rewind
Take our time re-living every single minute of last night
These two hands, left a lot unsaid
If you ain't out the door then it ain't over yet
So baby come back to bed
Baby, come back to bed
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I know you got somewhere you gotta be
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, you're right, it's right here next to me
So come back to bed, baby, don't leave
If I said I need your body, would you hold it against me?
Don't open the blinds, let's hit rewind
Take our time re-living every single minute of last night
These two hands, left a lot unsaid
If you ain't out the door then it ain't over yet
So baby, come back to bed
Yeah, come back to bed
Baby, come back to bed
Baby come back
Baby come back, come back
