Song Name: Walkaway Joe
Mama told her baby girl take it real slow
Girl told her momma hey I really gotta go
He's waiting in the car
Mama said girl you won't get far
Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh, if she could have only seen
That fate's got cards that it don't want to show and
That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word "go"
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Just a little while into Abilene
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waitin' in the car
Underneath the Texaco star
She only wanted love
Never bargained for this
She can't help but love him for the way he is
She's only seventeen
And there ain't no reasoning
So she'll ride this ride
As far as it can go, 'cause
That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word "go"
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arms
But she'll just keep reachin' on
For the cold hard truth revealed what it had known
That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word "go"
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boy's was a Walkaway Joe
All he was was a Walkaway Joe
Ooh, (Walkaway Joe)
He was a walkaway Joe
