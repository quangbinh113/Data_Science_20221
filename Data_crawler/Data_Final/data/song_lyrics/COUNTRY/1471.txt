Song Name: Unwanted Man
Like an old worn-out corduroy coat
Down at the lost and found
I meant nothin' to no one
'Til you picked me up off the ground
Like a stray dog off of the streets
I was shivering to the bone
You gave me shelter from the cold freezin' rain
Inside the comforts of your home
And you'll find behind my crooked smile
Hiding beneath the red wine on my breath
Lies the fear of losin' you, God only knows
How just the thought scares my heart half to death
'Cause when push comes to shove, only your love
Loves me for what I'm not and what I am
And for once in my life, I don't feel like
An unwanted man
I was a lone rolling stone
Headed south-bound on a slick downhill slide
Until you reached out, softly took my calloused hands
I was never satisfied
You'll find behind my crooked smile
Hiding beneath the red wine on my breath
Lies the fear of losin' you, God only knows
How just the thought scares my heart half to death
'Cause when push comes to shove, only your love
Loves me for what I'm not and what I am
And for once in my life, I don't feel like
An unwanted man
And though I see my name shine up on that marquee sign
You know it's nothin' but another one-night stand
'Cause when they turn off those lights, here come those lonely nights
No one but you can understand this unwanted man
You'll find behind my crooked smile
Hiding beneath the red wine on my breath
Lies the fear of losin' you, God only knows
How just the thought scares my heart half to death
'Cause when push comes to shove, only your love
Loves me for what I'm not and what I am
And for once in my life, I don't feel like
An unwanted man
Girl, for once in my life
I don't feel like an unwanted man
