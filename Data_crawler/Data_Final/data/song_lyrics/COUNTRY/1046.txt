Song Name: Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in the Mississippi heart
Too much love in the Louisiana heart
See the alligator all waitin' nearby
Sooner or later they know I'm gonna try
When she wave from the bank don't you know I know
It's goodbye fishin' line, see you while ago
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side
The Mississippi River don't look so wide
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well, I thought I'd been loved but I never had
'Til I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man
When he holds me close it feels almost
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast
If he can't come to me I'm gonna go to him
That Mississippi River Lord I'm gonna swim
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well, Mississippi River, Lord, it's one mile wide
And I'm gotta get me to the other side
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind
Gotta have your loving one more time
I'm gonna jump in the river and here I go
Too bad, alligator you swim too slow
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in the Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Hey
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in the Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in the Louisiana heart
Hey
