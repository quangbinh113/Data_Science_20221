Song Name: Rest Of My Life
There's a picture-frame hangin' a little to the side
Some drugs on the counter in the kitchen by the wine
And I'm shakin' like winter but I just can't eat
It's just one of those late nights that I'm never gonna beat
And I lay down for a moment and my eyes start closin'
I can't help but wonder why, yeah it's just the rest of my life
Let a couple hours go by then I bet it's gonna be alright
It was late September it was right on time
And it seemеd like forever had been wеighin' on my mind
We were barely speakin' there was no way out
It was probably my fault, it always is somehow
And I lay down for a moment and my eyes start closin'
I can't help but wonder why, yeah it's just the rest of my life
Let a couple hours go by then I bet it's gonna be alright
And I lay down for a moment and my eyes start closin'
I can't help but wonder why, yeah it's just the rest of my life
Let a couple hours go by then I bet it's gonna be alright
Yeah I bet it's gonna be alright
Yeah I bet it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
There's a picture-frame hangin' a little to the side
Some drugs on the counter in the kitchen by the wine
