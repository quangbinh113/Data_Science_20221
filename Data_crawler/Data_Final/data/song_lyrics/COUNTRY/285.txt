Song Name: Prayed For You
I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I'll move it myself

I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher, but I'm a believer
'Cause every single day before, I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes that see me through
A smile that steals me
A heart that heals me, a touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect
I guess the good Lord heard it
'Cause every single day before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope fails
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
Every single day before I knew your name
I couldn't see your, face but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I pray for you
I kept my faith like that old King James said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for you
