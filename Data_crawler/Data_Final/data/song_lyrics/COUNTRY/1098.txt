Song Name: You Belong To Somebody Else
The way you look when you cry make me wanna confess to you
The way you wear that dress, like it couldn't mean less to you
And there's no reason, keeping secrets
Maybe regrets is our weakness
Let all the jealous guards can bound me down and start again
'Cause you belong to somebody else
And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it
And I know it's wrong to call this sweet Hell, upon myself
You belong to somebody else (somebody else)
Don't wanna come home late and make a mistake for you
It's easier to let a heart wait than make a heart break for you
I gave you pieces, all my secrets, like religion to believe in
And all the jealous guards can burn me down and start again
'Cause you belong to somebody else
And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it
And I know it's wrong to call this sweet Hell, upon myself
You belong to somebody else (somebody else)
Hmm-hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm
I know it's wrong to call this sweet Hell, upon myself
You belong to somebody else (somebody else)
Yeah, yeah
Somebody else
Oh, oh-oh, yeah-ayy, yeah
Somebody else
Oh, oh-oh, yeah-ayy, yeah (make a heart break for you)
Somebody else
Oh, yeah, yeah
