Song Name: Beers On Me
Everybody's got a problem, so do I
But we ain't gonna solve 'em on a Saturday night
I just put a paycheck in the bank
And I ain't hit the town in a minute to drink
You had one of them, one of those weeks
Stuck on repeat, I'll save you a seat
Come on down
Swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap
And bottles on ice
Livin' on feel good standard time
My card's on the bar
You've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through
Buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me
Yeah, the beer's on me
(Ain't that right, HARDY?)
Yeah, I'ma get a round or two for all I want
Just a-bustin' your back while you're cussin' the sun
And if your girl don't love you no more
Well, here's a tall boy to cry in and it's been paid for
And if you're short on cash, say cheers
Don't sweat it, leave the sweatin' to the beer and
Come on down
Swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap
And bottles on ice
Livin' on feel good standard time
My card's on the bar
You've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through
Buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me
Yeah, the beer's on me
(Drink it down)
I like my drinks like my roof, on the house
We turnin' up, got double cups, the sun's goin' down
With lagers, I'm a boxer, yeah, I need 'bout 12 rounds
And I could be your sponsor if you like how that sounds
Tell me what you're drinkin', buckets for a Lincoln
I could cover you and me and everyone you're bringin'
Come on down
Swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap
And bottles on ice
Livin' on feel good standard time
My card's on the bar
You've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through
Buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me
Yeah, the beer's on me
The beer's on me
Gonna save you a seat
'Cause the beer's on me
Come get a Bud heavy, Busch Light
Kill a cold Miller, Blue Moon, Red Stripe
Naturday don't matter to me
'Cause don't nothing taste better than free
Yeah, the beer's on me
