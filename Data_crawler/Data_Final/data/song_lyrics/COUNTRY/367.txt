Song Name: Kerosene
I'm waitin' on the sun to set
'Cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes
There's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walking
Spinning tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me
I gave it everything I had
And everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it's too long
To live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie
Cheating really ain't a crime
I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Forget you high society
I'm soakin' it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn
Teach them what they need to learn, ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin'
Ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
Well I'm givin' up on love 'cause loves given up on me
Now I don't hate the one who left
You can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holdin' on to someone
I'm holding up my smokin' gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame
The day she changes her last name
Well I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Well I'm givin' up on love, hey, love's given up on me
