Song Name: Watermelon Crawl
I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
Rhine County Watermelon Festival ahead
Well, I wasn't in a hurry, so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor
He said, "We got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive
Do the watermelon crawl"
When the band started playin
The watermelon queen said
"Let me show you somethin'
That you ain't never seen"
She grabbed me by the arm said
"Come on lets go"
She dipped down, spun around, and do-si-doed
She rocked back on her heels
Dropped down to her knees
Crawled across the floor
Then she jumped back on her feet
She wiggled and she jiggled
Beat all you ever saw
Said this is how you do
The watermelon crawl
She said, "We got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive
Do the watermelon crawl"
If you're ever down in Georgia 'round about July
If you ain't in a hurry, then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that you're goin have a ball
Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl
Well, we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive
Do the watermelon crawl
Yeah, do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
Yeah, do the watermelon crawl
