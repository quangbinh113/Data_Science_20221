Song Name: Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right
A woman is a mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you gotta take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard you sigh
You lean into my kiss and close
Those deep blue need-you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby, I
Must be doin' somethin' right
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Whatever you say
Tonight's about givin' you what you want
Whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
Judgin' by the smile on your face
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard you sigh
You lean into my kiss and close
Those deep blue need-you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby, I
Must be doin' somethin' right

Oh baby
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby, I
Must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right
Oh yeah
Must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right (doin' somethin' right)
Don't know what I did (don't know what I did)
Must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right
