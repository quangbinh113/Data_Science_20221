Song Name: Tennessee Whiskey
Used to spend my nights out in a bar room
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth
As Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
As strawberry wine
You're as warm
As a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love
All the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottles always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth
As Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
As strawberry wine
You're as warm
As a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love
All the time

You're as smooth
As Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
As strawberry wine

You're as warm
As a glass of brandy
Honey, I stay stoned on your love
All the time
You're as smooth
As Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
You're as smooth
As Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
