Song Name: Whiskey And You
There's a bottle
On the dresser by your ring
And it's empty
So right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurting
When I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow
I can walk in a store
It ain't a problem
They'll always sell me more
It's your forgiveness
Well, that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
One's the devil
One keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder
If they ain't both the same
One's a liar
That helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
I've got a problem
But it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome
And I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down
And bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
One's the devil
One keeps driving me insane
At times, I wonder
Ohhw if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar
That helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
Ah, that's the difference between whiskey and you
