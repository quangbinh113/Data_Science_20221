Song Name: Shenandoah Shakedown
There's a crack in the altar
Pale light through the break
Like crooked teeth
And I couldn't fault her
Knowing what was at stake
Nothing worth underneath
And the hills move like lungs, the river speaks in tongues
And I am not alone
Naked Shenandoah
Shaking me down
Banks lined with foam
I saw you trembling
All wrapped up in a towel
Afraid to go home
And the sky frozen black
Covered my wayward tracks
As I left to get stoned
Sap of recollection
Bleeds to the ground
And hardens the soil
Fights of temporal affection, poison the vein
And loosen the coil
And if I could find a use for things, I cannot help but do
I might one day atone
I'm coming down from your mountain
I wanna kick in my own door
Regain my native sight
Shed these worries unfounded
I'll leave them, there on the floor
In the blue television light
And the wolves are closing in
The blood runs cold and thin
And the moon shines bright as bone
And the hills move like lungs
The river speaks in tongues
And I am not alone
