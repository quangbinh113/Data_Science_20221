Song Name: Keep On Smilin'
Well you say you've got the blues
You got holes in both of your shoes yeah
You're feeling alone and confused
You got to keep on smilin'
Just keep on smilin'
Yeah you're, you're about to go insane
'Cause your woman's playing games
And she says that you're to blame
You try to keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughing at the pain
Just flowing with the changes
Till the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughing at the pain
Just flowing with the changes
And singing this refrain
Singing in a honky-tonk cafe
Nobody's hearing what you play yeah
They're too busy drinking anyway
You gotta keep on smilin'
Brother keep on smilin'
Say ya, ya found a piece of land
Gonna change from city boy to country man yeah
Try to build your life with your hands
And just keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughing at the pain
Just flowing with the changes
Keep on singing this refrain
You just hanging out in a local bar
And you're wondering who the hell you are
Are you a farmer
Are you a star
Smile on through the rain
Laugh all through the pain
Flow on with the changes
Till the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' (smilin') smilin' (smilin')
Laughing (laughing) said laughing (laughing)
Keep on flowing, flowing, flowing (flowing) yeah ooh-ooh
Smilin' (smilin') smilin' (smilin')
You got to laugh alot...
