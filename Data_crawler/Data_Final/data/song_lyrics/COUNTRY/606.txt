Song Name: (This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing
I been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme, or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
Forget mathematical equations
Self-help psychology
Gray matter don't matter much darlin'
When it's gettin' down to you and me, oh
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme, or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
There's nothing that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme, or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
This ain't, no, this ain't no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing, girl, no
No this ain't no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing
Ain't no thinkin' thing, girl
This ain't no thinkin' thing, baby
This ain't, this ain't, this ain't, no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing
