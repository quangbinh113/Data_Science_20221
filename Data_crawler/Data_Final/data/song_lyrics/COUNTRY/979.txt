Song Name: MARILYN
Must be nice to be so nice and beautiful
Hang the stars in the eyes of everybody
Got your name up in lights and in every home
But were you still alone at the party?
Everybody wanted to see you, lips red, eyes blue
And everybody wanted to be you, yeah
Was it worth it to seem so perfect?
Blonde and curves didn't keep you from your skeletons
Was it lonely, show pony?
Did you miss Norma Jeane
Or did you always wanna be Marilyn?
Marilyn
Once you got through the doors, was it glamorous?
Or did you think you'd feel more fulfilled? Mmm
'Cause I can see how it seemed through an LA silver screen
But I can also see how it'd drive me to pills
So was it worth it to seem so perfect?
Blonde and curves didn't keep you from your skeletons
Was it lonely, show pony?
Did you miss Norma Jeane
Or did you always wanna be Marilyn?
Oh, Marilyn
Everybody wanted to see you, lips red, eyes blue
And everybody wanted to know you in every room
Was the way that everyone loved you a feeling you outgrew?
'Cause everybody wanted to be you, but did you? Mmm
Was it worth it to seem so perfect?
Blonde and curves didn't keep you from your skeletons
Was it lonely, show pony?
Did you miss Norma Jeane, the woman underneath
Or did you always wanna be Marilyn?
Oh, Marilyn
Uh, do I feel happy in life? Um
Um, let's see
