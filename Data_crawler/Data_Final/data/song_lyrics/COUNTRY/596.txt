Song Name: Ain't That Lonely Yet
You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone, well that's real sad
And you keep leavin' notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more, girl that's too bad
Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web, of love and lies
She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go, oh but I survived
Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
Nothing left you can do to try and bring me 'round
Cause everything you do, brings me down, wo-oh
And I, ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
