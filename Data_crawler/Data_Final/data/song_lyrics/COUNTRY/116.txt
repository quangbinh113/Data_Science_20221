Song Name: 19 Somethin' - Greatest Hits Version
I saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside Stretch Armstrong, yeah
I was Roger Stauback in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried
It was 1970 somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hairdo days
Bell Bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin back now, I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy?
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1970 something
It was the dawning of a new decade
When we got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried
It was 1980 something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin back now I can see me
Oh man, did I look cheesy?
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980 something
Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
(Sometimes)
It was 1980 something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating Rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin back now I can see me
Oh man, did I look cheesy?
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980 something
1970 something, aw, it was 19 something
