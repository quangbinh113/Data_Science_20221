Song Name: Peter Pan
The smile, the charm, the words, the spark
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart
'Cause boy I let you have it
You said I was your only
I never thought you'd leave me lonely
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground
Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
But now it's happily ever never
I guess now I know better
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground
Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Oh-oh-oh-oh, mmh
You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy
Too busy chasing stars
And you're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up (oh, you'll never grow up)
You're never gonna be a man
You'll never grow up
Yeah, you're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man
