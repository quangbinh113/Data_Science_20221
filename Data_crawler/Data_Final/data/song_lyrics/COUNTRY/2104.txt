Song Name: Whole World Gone Crazy
News runnin' wild on the TV screen
Repeatin' shit that I've already seen
People pointin' fingers takin' no kind of blame
But when it rains it pours ain't ya doin' the same
Ol' shit, it reciprocates
Tell me that ain't the truth in this case
You need some Levon Helm to send ya back
In to grammar school
The calvary is headed your way
But me, I'ma try to get right with the man
Forgive me for my sins
And what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy
Tryin' to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy?
Find myself runnin' down yonder to the corner store
Just a-minding my business tryin' to get me some smoke
My guy talkin' politicky telling me to take a stand
Agree to disagree was in the cards at hand
Said are ya left or right or fickle? 'Cause
There ain't no play the middle
Now, boy which route is this gonna be
But me, I'ma try to get right with the man
Forgive me for my sins
And what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy
Tryin' to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy?
Me, I'ma try to get right with the man
Forgive me for my sins
And what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy
Tryin' to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone
Me, I'ma try to get right with the man
Forgive me for my sins
And what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy
Tryin' to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy?
