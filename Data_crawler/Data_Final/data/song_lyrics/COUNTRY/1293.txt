Song Name: Truth About You - Piano Version
Oh, yeah
Well, this town's been telling me I've done some things I never did
Yeah, the grapevine starts with a glass of wine and you taking a sip
Every word that you're saying's another step to my reputation
And I can't take it anymore
But you've opened that door
Yeah, there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
In the end, we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle?
Call it even, call it truce
If you quit telling lies about me
I won't tell the truth about you
No, I won't
Like how you pick to fight every time you saw me get attached
To make yourself feel better, that you still talk to your ex
Yeah, you told your friends, you told your mama
That I'm the root of all the drama
But we both know why they're saying it
Girl, I caught you red-handed
Yeah, there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
In the end, we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle?
Call it even, call it truce
If you quit telling lies about me
Well, I won't tell the truth about you, oh
Yeah, I truly wish the best for you
So don't ruin the next for me
'Cause you really don't want me to tell the truth
Oh, for everyone to see, yeah
That there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
In the end, we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle?
Call it even, call it truce
Yeah, if you quit telling lies about me
Well, I won't tell the truth about you, oh
I won't, I won't
Oh, I swear I won't
'Cause I don't want you, baby
I don't, I don't wanna tell the truth
