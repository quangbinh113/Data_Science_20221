Song Name: Somethin' 'Bout A Truck
There's somethin' 'bout a truck, in a farmers field
A "No Trespass" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so whats the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmers field
There's somethin' 'bout a beer sittin' on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that drop tailgate, on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout a beer, sittin' on ice
Yea there's somethin' 'bout a girl, in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer, pressed against her lips
In that farmers field, will make a boy a man
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
And there's somethin' 'bout a kiss, that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Somethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 a.m.
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
