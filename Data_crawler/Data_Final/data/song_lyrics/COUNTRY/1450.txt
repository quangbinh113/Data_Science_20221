Song Name: Around Forever
Soak it up, cold beer
Drinking with the boys back around here
Like it's senior year
And life ain't hit us yet
Tippin back to catching touchdowns
Big stars in a small town
Some of us rolled out
Some of us will stick around forever
Life's spins like a Haggard record
Goes from good to bad to better
Nah ya can't get it back
The sand in ya glass
Gotta live it like it's now or never
Laughin' 'bout that time on spring break
Sittin, sippin on a rusted tailgate
Yeh tonight's gonna end
So we're takin it in
While we're all together
Ain't gonna be around forever
My view's best when
That sun kisses her skin
Early morning light, hittin just right
On her side of the bed
God gave me a best friend
She's an angel she's a blessin
Best one He ever sent down
And He's been around, forever
Life's spins like a Haggard record
Goes from good to bad to better
Nah ya can't get it back
The sand in ya glass
Gotta love her like it's now or never
Hold her tight let her know I got her
No matter what come hell or high water
Say all I need to say
Make the most of every day
That we get together
Wanna keep her around forever
Wanna keep her around forever
Daddy use to throw me in the sky
Like I was super man
It's funny lookin back now
Cause that's who I thought he was back then
I didn't know, he'd grow old
And wouldn't be around forever
Life's spins like a Haggard record
Goes from good to bad to better
Nah ya can't get back
The sand in ya glass
Gotta live it like it's now or never
Yeah we're lucky that we got love in life
So don't hesitate to take time
Make your call when you can
Take every little chance
To get together
They won't be around forever
They won't be around forever
