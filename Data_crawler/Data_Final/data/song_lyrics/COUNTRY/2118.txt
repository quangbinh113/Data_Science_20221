Song Name: Her Name Is...
Oh, I love her and just can't live without her
And I've got the urge to tell the world about her

But our love's a secret and can't see the light of day
But I went and wrote this love song anyway.
Her name is her eyes are
Her hair is just like and she measures

But someday I'll fill in the lines when she and I are free
And we'll walk in the sunshine and me.

--- Instrumental ---
Oh, it really is a scandal and disgrace
To have to call your woman what's-her-face
But her husband thinks he owns her heart and soul for life
And he'll kill the man who messes with his wife.
Her name is her eyes are

Her hair is just like and she measures
But someday I'll fill in the lines when she and I are free
And we'll walk in the sunshine and me.

Yes, someday I'll fill in the lines when she and I are free
And we'll walk in the sunshine and me.

Her name is
