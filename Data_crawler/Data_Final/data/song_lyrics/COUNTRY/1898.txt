Song Name: Birthday Girl (feat. Chris Lane)
You woke up this morning, yawning
Your phone is blowing up, they saying, "Let's go out tonight"
The low cut Versace, you bought in your closet
For this here occasion, you gon' look amazing tonight
Play that playlist, getting ready with your best friend
Shawty you a gift and blessing downtown with your presence (yeah)
ID in your pocket (uh-huh), didn't even bring no Prada (uh-huh)
'Cause you ain't worried about paying for nada
'Cause it's yo birthday, girl
The day your mama brought you into this world (yeah)
Give what she gave you, just a little more shake than you normally do
Today you can have your cake and eat it too
Tonight's your night (your night)
Dance on the table, kiss a random guy (like me)
Forget the haters watching you act a fool 'til the last song
It's yo bash, get yo smash and yo sash on
'Cause it's your birthday, girl, happy birthday, girl
Let 'em know
You know how to work your backside
Let 'em know
Bend them hundreds on the front side
You the queen
It's your day to be a handful
Show out to blow out, blow out your candles
'Cause it's yo birthday, girl
The day your mama brought you into this world (ay)
Give what she gave you, just a little more shake than you normally do
Today, you can have your cake and eat it too
Tonight's your night (your night)
Dance on the table, kiss a random guy (like me)
Forget the haters watching you act a fool 'til the last song
It's yo bash, get yo smash and yo sash on
'Cause it's your birthday, girl
Tell 'em what you dream (tell 'em)
Make it disappear (tell 'em)
Girls this kinda happy only happens once a year
Tomorrow you can chill (you can chill) in bed all afternoon
But tonight, let's get it cracking, keep popping like a balloon
It's your birthday, girl, happy birthday, girl (yeah)
'Cause it's yo birthday, girl
The day your mama brought you into this world
Give what she gave you, just a little more shake than you normally do
Today, you can have your cake and eat it too (you can have your cake and eat it too)
Tonight's your night (your night)
Dance on the table, kiss a random guy (like me)
Forget the haters watching you act a fool 'til the last song ('til the last song)
It's yo bash, get yo smash and yo sash on
'Cause it's your birthday, girl, happy birthday, girl
'Cause it's your birthday, girl (happy birthday, girl)
