Song Name: SMALL TOWN STATE OF MIND
It's a pick you up if you need a ride
Pull you out with a four-wheel drive
It's a "How's your mama doin'?" in the check-out line
It's a two-lane everywhere ya go
Meet up at the Texaco
It's a come on, sit down, make yourself at home
Just layin' it back and catchin' a buzz
It's a simple life and I just can't get enough
Of that small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Good friends and a bottle shine
Whenever you roll up, you're right on time
That small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
It's a southern breeze on 'em Georgia pines
Soul food and some homemade wine
It's a high school football game on a Friday night
It's a crickets singin' like a Sunday choir (yeah)
Tailgate down by the fire while I'm stealin' a kiss
Yeah, it don't get better than this
Just layin' it back and catchin' a buzz
It's a simple life and I just can't get enough
Of that small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Good friends and a bottle shine
Whenever you roll up, you're right on time
That small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Somethin' 'bout this town just gets me
Everywhere ya go, yeah, there's someone that ya know
Nothin' like that down-home feelin'
Every single time when I hit that county line
And I'm right back in
That small town state of mind
Small town state of mind (feels good)
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Back in that small town state of mind
Small town state of mind (that's home)
Small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
Good friends and a bottle shine
Whenever you roll up, you're right on time
That small town state of mind
Small town state of mind
(Small town state of mind)
(Small town state of mind) state of mind
(Small town state of mind)
(Small town state of mind) yeah
