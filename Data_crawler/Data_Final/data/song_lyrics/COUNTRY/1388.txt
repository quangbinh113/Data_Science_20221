Song Name: Stone Harbor
98th Street is where I grew up
Hoy's 5 & 10 and a Springer's waffle cup
Taking trips to Sam's in Wildwood
Beach babes, Hobie Cats
Sue and Rick's Fishin' Pier - you gotta try that
It's where I'm from, it runs in my blood
There's a lot of things in life I love
But not as much
As Stone Harbor
Where you just kick it back in the water
Spraying that Coppertone up all on you
Hop on your little floaty in the bay in the high tide
I think you oughta
Visit my beach town alma mater
In the summertime when it's getting hotter, no problems
Whatcha say, baby? Whatcha wanna do in Stone Harbor?
In Stone Harbor
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
We could hit up the Wawa
Them F'real shakes and soft pretzels got me 'aw nah'
Don't forget that change when you cash out (oh yeah)
It's getting wild at the Windrift
Cover band's off-key (ha) but they're killing it
Making all them young girls fall in love
There's other towns where you could turn it up
But not as much
As Stone Harbor
Where you just kick it back in the water
Spraying that Coppertone up all on you
Hop on your little floaty in the bay in the high tide
I think you oughta
Visit my beach town alma mater
In the summertime when it's getting hotter, no problems
Whatcha say, baby? Whatcha wanna do in Stone Harbor?
Yeah, in Stone Harbor
Laying down in the reeds
You can smell the low tide, the summer-cool bay breeze
Blowing on that salty sun-kissed skin
In Stone Harbor
Where you just kick it back in the water
Spraying that Coppertone up all on you
Hop on your little floaty in the bay in the high tide
I think you oughta
Visit my beach town alma mater
In the summertime when it's getting hotter, no problems
Whatcha say, baby? Whatcha wanna do?
In Stone Harbor
Where you just kick it back in the water
Spraying that Coppertone up all on you
Hop on your little floaty in the bay in the high tide
I think you oughta
Visit my beach town alma mater
In the summertime when it's getting hotter, no problems
Whatcha say, baby? Whatcha wanna do in Stone Harbor?
Yeah, in Stone Harbor
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
