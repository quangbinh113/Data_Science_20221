Song Name: I Wanna Remember (feat. Carrie Underwood) - Acoustic
This feels like
One of those moments movin' by so fast
You wanna do somethin' just to make it last
You wanna do somethin' to remember
Breathe it in
The feel of your body on my fingertips
The moonlight on fire and the clothes we're in
We gotta do somethin' to remember
We don't wanna forget it
I wanna memorize you, wanna stay here forever
'Cause I, I
I take a picture in my mind so we're always together
'Cause I, I, I wanna remember
I wanna remember (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
The night is clear
All of the stars out in the atmosphere
Wishin' that they were you and me right here
They're showin' off for us, I don't wanna forget it
I wanna memorize you, wanna stay here forever
'Cause I, I
I take a picture in my mind so we're always together
'Cause I, I, I wanna remember
I wanna remember (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Oh, I don't know how
Every second gets better
I wanna be here now
I want to remember
Hey, I wanna memorize you, wanna stay here forever
'Cause I, yeah, I
I take a picture in my mind so we're always together
'Cause I, I, I wanna remember
Oh, I wanna remember, yeah, ooh (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I want to remember, mmm
Oh, I wanna remember
