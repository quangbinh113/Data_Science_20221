Song Name: Carried Away
I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But, darlin', when you come around
I get carried away by the look, by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on, baby, I'm long gone
I get carried away, nothing matters, but being with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away
It might seem like an ordinary night
Same old stars, the same old moon up high
But when I see you standin' at your door
Nothing's ordinary anymore
I get carried away by the look, by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on, baby, I'm long gone
I get carried away, nothing matters, but being with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away
I get carried away, nothing matters, but being with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away
Carried away
