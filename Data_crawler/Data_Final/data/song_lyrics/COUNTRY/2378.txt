Song Name: Crazy One More Time - Revisited
Come on out Mary-jane I'm looking through your window pane.
I heard the word, you're back in town.
I got some cheap cigarettes, your favorite beer,
Girl wear the dress i always dream about.
We'll chase the moon, ride the stars,
Find the muscle in this car, I know we've still got something left.
So come on out take my hand feel my heart
Girl understand I've got a thunder pounding in my chest.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
And girl tonight let's go crazy one more time.
We'll park the car, climb the hood turn it up when something good
Starts playing through these rusty doors.
In the sticky sweet air tonight, I'll kiss you girl till I get it right
Cause I know, that'll lead to more.
The weeds have all grown around where I gently lay you down
And I try to tell you how I feel.
But you'll place your finger on my mouth, whisper "baby, no not now".
The night is young and we still got time to steal.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
Girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time.
With the engine burning through my jeans, I watch you fall
Fast asleep and this small town sky, fade from black to blue.
And I wipe a tear from my eye but you'll never know
Cause baby I'll smile, as I wave goodbye to you.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
And girl tonight let's go crazy one more time.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
Girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time.
I guess I'll always have this longing in my heart,
And you'll have a piece of me.
But tonight there's a fire to start in our red, burning hearts
And you're all that I'll ever need.
