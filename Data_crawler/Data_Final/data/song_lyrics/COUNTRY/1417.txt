Song Name: Watch It
Watch It,
You'll climb that maple-tree so high
That you won't find your way back to the ground,
Watch It,
You'll dump that pedal-bike for goodness sakes,
If you don't learn to hit them brakes more than
You do now,
And Watch It with your tone,
When you butt heads with Mama... You don't
Run this home,
Run around it all you want, 'cause it's your
Safe place,
To be exactly who you are,
You won't always have it easy, but you'll
Always have our hearts,
They say take life one day at a time and I'm tryin'
But it's flyin'
The world spins 'round and there's no way to bottle the lightnin'
Or rewind it,
You're growing up so fast and I wish so bad that I could stop it,
But baby I'm so glad that I'm the one who gets the chance,
To Watch It
When you first drive a car, yeah that's the start
Of a lot of sleepless nights 'round here,
And I'll Watch It
Slowly fall apart when someone breaks your
Heart and I can't do a thing to stop them tears,
For now we're busy laughing at whatever's on TV,
Someday it'll happen â€“ you'll be too cool for me
They say take life one day at a time and I'm
Tryin' but it's flyin'
The world spins 'round and there's no way to
Bottle the lightnin'
Or rewind it,
You're growing up so fast and I wish so bad that I could stop it,
But baby I'm so glad that I'm the one who
Gets the chance,
To Watch It
God I love to Watch It
So tonight I'm going to soak it in, and let you
Hug me all you want,
'Cause memories last forever, but moments
Don't last long
They say take life one day at a time and I'm tryin'
But it's flyin'
The world spins 'round and there's no way to
Bottle the lightnin'
Or rewind it,
You're growing up so fast and I wish so bad that I could stop it,
But baby I'm so glad that I'm the one who gets the chance,
To Watch It
God I love to Watch It
Watch It
