Song Name: It Wasnâ€™t Love
You were just a rebound
From the other that did me down
My pure heart was nowhere and never gonna be found
I kinda felt ashamed
But I liked playing games
Convinced myself that I'd be fine
'Cause I wouldn't be the one getting hurt this time
But it wasn't love
I was just having fun
I hope you didn't think I was gonna be the one
But you gave me so much and I can't thank you enough
'Cause while I drug you through the mud
I rinsed the boldest to the earth
But I know how it sounds
But I needed a way out
Don't act like you have never done that to someone else
'Cause how you felt about me
Was how I felt about him
And you may have come of black and blue
But at least you're growing thicker skin
Well as you thought that I'd be fine
'Cause I wouldn't be the one getting hurt this time
But it wasn't love
I was just having fun
I hope you didn't think I was gonna be the one
But you gave me so much and I can't thank you enough
'Cause while I drug you through the mud
I rinsed the boldest to the earth
White lies to have goodbyes
I knew I couldn't survive
I had to have someone around
To keeping me from spiraling
You took my mind off of him
I'm so glad you pulled me out
And I'm so sorry o pushed you down
But it wasn't love
I was just having fun
I hope you didn't think I was gonna be the one
But you gave me so much and I can't thank you enough
'Cause while I drug you through the mud
I rinsed the boldest to the earth
And while I drug you through the mud
I rinsed the boldest to the earth
