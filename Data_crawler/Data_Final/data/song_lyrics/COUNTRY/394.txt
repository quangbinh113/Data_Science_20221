Song Name: People Are Crazy
This old man and me
We're at the bar and we
We're havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
He said I fought two wars
Been married and divorced
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, damn if I know
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, these damn things will kill me yet
But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
Last call it's 2:00 a.m.
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
