Song Name: Third Rate Romance - Remastered
Sittin at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applyin booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
But they were old enough to talk it out and keep it loose
She said you dont look like my type but I guess you'll do

He said I'll even tell you that I love you if you want me too

When they left the bar they got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the family inn She didnt even have to pretend she
Didnt know what for
And then he went to the desk and made his request while she
Waited outside
He came back with the key and she said give it to me and I'll
Unlock the door
She kept saying I've never really done this kind of thing before
Have you

And he said yes I have but only a time or two
