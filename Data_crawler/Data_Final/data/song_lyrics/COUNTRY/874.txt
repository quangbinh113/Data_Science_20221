Song Name: Merry Christmas Baby
Merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
I said merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
(Take it home, baby, take it home)
I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm putting it through Al's mike
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
