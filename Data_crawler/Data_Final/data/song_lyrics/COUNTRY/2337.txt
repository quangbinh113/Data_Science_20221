Song Name: I Know A Little
Yes sir
Well the bigger the city well the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog well the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
But I think Mama you ain't doin' right
Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Well now I don't read that daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people get the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themselves they'd be much less abused
Say I know a little
Lord I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Play me a little
Whoa
Yeah
Well now you want me to be your only man
Said listen up Mama teach you all I can
Do right baby by your man
Don't worry Mama I'll teach you all I can
Say I know a little
Lord I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Well I know a little about love
Baby I want your best
