Song Name: see you later (ten years)
It's funny 'cause I've always dreamed of me and you
Now here we are
Staring at the stars
You just broke my heart even though you promised
You'd never do that from the start
But I guess we can only make it so far
'Cause time wasn't in our favour
This isn't goodbye, this is simply see you later
Let me know when it's time to come back
Maybe when your life is on track
And you don't have to hesitate
Hopefully it isn't too late
Luckily for you, I'm patient
I'm okay with your making me wait
And as long as you're near, I'll be here
Even if it takes ten years
Can't fall in love, when I found the one
How am I supposed to move on
When you're never really too far gone
The memories won't go away
I feel pain every time I hear your name
But I always think of you the same
'Cause time wasn't in our favour

This isn't goodbye, this is simply see you later

Let me know when it's time to come back
Maybe when your life is on track
And you don't have to hesitate
Hopefully it isn't too late
Luckily for you, I'm patient
I'm okay with your making me wait
And as long as you're near, I'll be here
Even if it takes ten years
Let me know when it's time to come back
Maybe when your life is on track
And you don't have to hesitate
Hopefully it isn't too late
Luckily for you, I'm patient
I'm okay with your making me wait
And as long as you're near, I'll be here
Even if it takes ten years
Even if it takes ten years
Even if it takes ten years
