Song Name: Baby I'm Burnin'
You look at me that way
I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me
I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me
The way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you
Each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red-hot emotion
Puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the 4th of July
There's no use in fighting
This fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
Baby, I'm burnin'
Baby, I'm burnin'
Baby, I'm burnin'
Baby, I'm burnin'
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
Baby, I'm burnin', out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol that's flamin' desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
