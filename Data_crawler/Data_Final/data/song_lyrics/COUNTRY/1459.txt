Song Name: Green
It takes a long time to forget
What caused a lifetime of regret
And the day slips slowly by
We can run, but we can't hide
And you asked me to forgive
You said, "Let's just go on and live"
Like it's my choice to make
Oh, honey, I bend, but I don't break
Things were different and we were young
And our story had just begun
Who knew that growing old could ever be so cold?
Together, but alone
Together, but alone
Now we sleep in different rooms
A love that blossomed, but never bloomed
Were we runnin' from
Somethin' we were scared to become?
Things were different and we were young
And our story had just begun
Who knew that growin' old could ever be so cold?
Together but alone
Together but alone
Things were different and we were young
And our story had just begun
Who knew that growin' old could ever be so cold?
Together but alone
Together but alone
Together but alone
Together but alone
