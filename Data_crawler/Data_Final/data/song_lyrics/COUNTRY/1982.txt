Song Name: The Flame
Were the red flags even really that red
I was calling danger was it all in my head
I Said I wanted love but only if it's perfect
But nobody's enough if you never put the work in
Maybe I've been chasing flowers
Running from all the rain
Maybe I'm a god damn coward
Only got myself to blame
Got a little too good at making up excuses
Lying to myself but the truth is
Maybe I been chasing fire
When I should be chasing the flame
Every bit of magic starts with a spark
I should be more gentle with somebody's heart
Ain't we all just human
Don't know what we're doin
Hoping our true colors
Will find each other in the dark
Maybe I've been chasing flowers
Running from all the rain
Maybe I'm a god damn coward
Only got myself to blame
Got a little too good at making up excuses
Lying to myself but the truth is
Maybe I been chasing fire
When I should be chasing the flame
I said I wanted love but only if it's perfect
Who's gonna be enough when I never put the work in
Maybe I've been chasing flowers
Running from all the rain
Maybe I'm a god damn coward
Only got myself to blame
Got a little too good at making up excuses
Lying to myself but the truth is
Maybe I been chasing fire
When I should be
I should be
I should be
Chasing the flame
The Flame
