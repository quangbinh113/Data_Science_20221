Song Name: Swimming Alone
It was a crawdad spring in a grasshopper song.
I had a dime store daddy and a paperback mother.
Sister had boyfriend, and brother's playin ball.
N' I was raisin myself the last of them all.
So I jumped in, closed my eyes.
There was a party goin on with nobody home.
Nowhere to find me, or lookin to find me,
I was outside in the backyard swimming alone.
I was a California dreamer in a hot Texas town,
And I was too young to drive but I still got around.
Climbin out of windows just to get stoned
Out there on the edge swimming alone.
Well I jumped in, closed my eyes.
I was always running away from home.
But on my side was my heart open wide.
I learned how to survive swimming alone, yeah.
I've had friends and lovers and so many others
I've had a lot of good deals and plans that I broke
Sometimes you get burned but that's how you learn
When you're out there in the world swimming alone.
So I jumped in, closed my eyes
Don't bother calling cuz I won't pick up the phone.
Baby don't mind me, you know where to find me.
I'm outside in the back yard swimming alone.
I'll be outside in the backyard swimming alone.
