Song Name: It's Christmas
The snow is on the ground
The family's all in town
It's Christmas
It's Christmas
The children want to know
Why we hung the mistletoe
It's Christmas
Then silently the night
Turns on a magic light
And it's Christmas
All over the world
And I hope that Santa Claus
Remembers every child because
It's Christmas
The lights upon the tree
Twinkle like a melody
It's Christmas
(It's Christmas)
There's a choir out in the night
Singing songs by candlelight
It's Christmas
With every face aglow
The young and old both know
It's Christmas
All over the world
Love is flowing free
And all the world's at peace
It's Christmas
(It's Christmas)
(It's Christmas)
With every face aglow
The young and old both know
It's Christmas
All over the world
And I hope that Santa Claus
Remembers every child because
It's Christmas
Love is flowing free
And all the world's at peace
It's Christmas
Merry Christmas everybody
