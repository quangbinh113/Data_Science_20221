Song Name: Horseshoes and Hand Grenades
When a few drinks turn into midnight dancing
And the pillow talk turns into weekend plans
That early morning ends with, "I'll call you again"
But one of us is lying, one of us is trying
There's a reason why the heart has a ribcage
There's a reason why a car has a handbrake
I'm a hopeless romantic from the first second on the first date
I guess we were just as close as a first kiss
Closer to God when you're down on your knees and praying
Yeah, close like a secret, you swore you would keep
But somehow you let it slip away
So close you can feel, it hurts when it's real
'Cause the other don't feel the same
Guess close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
Horseshoes and hand grenades
(Close but no cigar, close but no cigar, close but no cigar)
It's my fault for thinking too far in the future
It's your fault for going too far, it confused me
But when you're wrapped in the moment
You don't know it till the sunlight shows it
I guess we were just as close as a first kiss
Closer to God when you're down on your knees and praying
Yeah, close like a secret, you swore you would keep
But somehow you let it slip away
So close you can feel, it hurts when it's real
'Cause the other don't feel the same
Guess close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
Horseshoes and hand grenades
There's a reason why the heart has a ribcage
There's a reason why a car has a handbrake
I'm a hopeless romantic from the first second on the first date
I guess we were just as close as a first kiss
Closer to God when you're down on your knees and praying
Yeah, close like a secret, you swore you would keep
But somehow you let it slip away
So close you can feel, it hurts when it's real
'Cause the other don't feel the same
Guess close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
Horseshoes and hand grenades (Close but no cigar, close but no cigar, close but no cigar)
Horseshoes and hand grenades (Close but no cigar, close but no cigar, close but no cigar)
