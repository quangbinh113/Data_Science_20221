Song Name: A Little Bit Stronger
Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger
Ridin' in the car to work and I'm tryin' to ignore the hurt
So I turned on the radio, stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute but then I changed it
I'm gettin' a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger
And I'm done hopin' that we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
I'm done thinkin' that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
It doesn't happen overnight but ya turn around
And a month's gone by and you realize you haven't cried
I'm not givin' you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy gettin' stronger
And I'm done hopin' that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
I'm done thinkin' that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger
Gettin' along without you, baby
I'm better off without you, baby
How does it feel without me, baby?
I'm gettin' stronger without you, baby
And I'm done hopin' we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinkin' that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit stronger...
I get a little bit stronger
