Song Name: You In A Honky Tonk
Cotton flannel on a front porch swing
Leather jacket and some tight blue jeans
Don't get me started on the things I think
When you're wearing nothing but them soft white sheets, yeah
Listen, baby, you can put on anything
What drives me crazy
Is seeing you in a honky-tonk
The way you're slipping that neon on
Girl, there ain't a look you can't pull off
But nothing turns me on
Like you in a honky-tonk
Smoke rings, glowing greens and reds
They hug your body like a long black dress
It's tailor made for your silhouette
Ooh, nothing steals my breath
Like seeing you in a honky-tonk
The way you're slipping that neon on
Girl, there ain't a look you can't pull off
But nothing turns me on
Like you in a honky-tonk
Sipping and swaying and singing
Girl, all I'm saying is it fits you like a glove
Listen, baby, you can put on anything
But I just go crazy
Seeing you in a honky-tonk
The way you're slipping that neon on
Girl, there ain't a look you can't pull off
Nothing turns me on
Like you in a honky-tonk
The way you're slipping that neon on
Nah, there ain't a look you can't pull off
But nothing turns me on
Like you in a honky-tonk
Ah, in a honky-tonk
In a honky-tonk
