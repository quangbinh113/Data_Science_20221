Song Name: Blacked Out
I remember going out on a stretcher, someone laced my Jack
I saw the lights and I heard my song, then everything went black
I remember hearin' you sing to "Only Truck In Town"
Next thing I know, I'm three sheets gone passed out on the ground
I'm under the influence, liquor don't hit me like you can
You had my wheels a-turning, feeling like a deer when we first met
I had that black smoke rollin' on the back forty, can't forget the way
The way that I blacked out
Got a taste of the whiskey in here when you kiss me
Blacked out, but I wouldn't back down
You had me stoned, had me tipsy, somewhere deep down in Dixie
You were red dirt and gypsy, and I was far from sober
On a crisp October Sunday night
You and I were throwin' back Crown and Sprite
It felt so right tonight, tonight
Blacked out, yeah
I remember that grown-ass man that I put into place
I pushed you out the way, then I punched him in the face
I remember that same guy jumpin' out on us
So I floored it like you said and ran him over in my truck
I'm under the influence, liquor don't hit me like you can
You had my wheels a-turning, feeling like a deer when we first met
I had that black smoke rollin' on the back forty, can't forget the way
The way that I blacked out
Got a taste of the whiskey in here when you kiss me
Blacked out, but I wouldn't back down
You had me stoned, had me tipsy, somewhere deep down in Dixie
You were red dirt and gypsy, and I was far from sober
On a crisp October Sunday night
You and I were throwin' back Crown and Sprite
It felt so right tonight, tonight
100 proof got me burnin' up, and you were turnin' me on
Ended up in that EMS, damn, I wanted to take you home
Get lost, away from the crowd
I woke up in that hospital bed because I blacked out
Got a taste of the whiskey in here when you kiss me
Blacked out, but I wouldn't back down
You had me stoned, had me tipsy, somewhere deep down in Dixie
You were red dirt and gypsy, and I was far from sober
On a crisp October Sunday night
You and I were throwin' back Crown and Sprite
It felt so right tonight, tonight
Blacked out, yeah
