Song Name: Write It In Red
I can see what's going on
Don't treat me like a fool
Just go on and do just what you're gonna do
Don't leave some message for me
Of things, you wish you'd said
Just take out your lipstick and write it in red
'Cause if you're gonna leave me
Just pack up and go
There are just some things
A man don't need to know
And I don't wanna hear
What's going through your head
Just take out your lipstick and write it in red
I gave you all I had
And some that I didn't
I tried to talk and talk to you
But you didn't wanna listen
I tried to wipe the tears you shed
You turned away instead
So just take out your lipstick and write it in red
'Cause if you're gonna leave
Just pack up and go
There are just some things
A man don't need to know
And I don't wanna hear
What's going through your head
Just take out your lipstick and write it in red
If you're gonna leave me
Just pack up and go
There are just some things
A man don't need to know
And I don't wanna hear
What's going through your head
Just take out your lipstick and write it in red
Just take out your lipstick and write it in red
