Song Name: Thinking 'Bout You (feat. MacKenzie Porter)
Well, look who it is
Last call I thought I'd get
How's your mama, how you been?
Girl, it's been too long
Saw your sister at the Circle K
Heard baby number two is on the way
Hadn't seen her since her wedding day
With you on my arm
It's good to hear from you again
Girl, what a coincidence
I was just thinking 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars
On a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right outta the blue
I was just thinking 'bout you
(Oh, oh) I was just thinking 'bout you
Hmm, yeah
Hey, I just gotta say I heard your song the other day
And it put a smile on my face when I started reminiscing
I been on the edge of calling you
And I'm so glad I decided to
I was just thinking 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars
On a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right outta the blue
I was just thinking 'bout you
Oh, oh, I was just thinking 'bout you
If you're ever back in town
Do what you're doin' right now
'Cause I'm probably thinking 'bout you
I was just thinking 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars
On a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right outta the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you
