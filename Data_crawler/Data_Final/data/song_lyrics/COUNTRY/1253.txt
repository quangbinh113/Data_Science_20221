Song Name: Love Like I Drink
Sometimes it's too much, once I start I can't stop
I don't care if it's straight up, or if it's on the rocks
You're a habit I can't kick, always taste it on my lips
Yeah, I can really cause a scene
'Cause I love like I drink
Goin' down smooth and burnin' like hell
One shot of you, I want that bottle to myself
I go all in 'til I can't think straight
'Cause I love like I drink
Friends might get in the middle, try and intervene
But since you, I'm a lost cause, I'm in way too deep
You get to me like whiskey, knock me off my feet
I keep goin' 'til it kills me
'Cause I love like I drink
Goin' down smooth and burnin' like hell
One shot of you, I want that bottle to myself
I go all in 'til I can't think straight
'Cause I love like I drink
You shine a light inside of me, brighter than a neon sign
I'll chase every drop of you 'til the bottle runs dry
'Cause I love like I drink
Goin' down smooth and burnin' like hell
One shot of you, I want that bottle to myself
I go all in 'til I can't think straight
'Cause I love like I drink (I go all in)
Yeah, I love like I drink ('til I can't think straight)
'Cause I love like I drink (I go all in)
Yeah, I love like I drink ('til I can't think straight)
I love like I drink
