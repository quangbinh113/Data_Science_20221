Song Name: Dodge Out Of Hell
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
For sale sign on a dusty ol' dash
She paid in twenties, countin' coffee can cash
Told the old man, "I'll come back and get it later"
He said, "I'll fill her up, it'll be here waitin'"
Second hand Ram, brand new cam
Lotta static on the radio
V8 Hemi, it'll do 120
Blow the black off a blacktop road
She's got a lead foot itchin' for the pedal
And she's tired of livin' with the devil himself
So, she's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
(She's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell)
He's mean when he drinks and he drinks too much
He's always gettin' lit, it's her turn to light it up
Droppin' matches on the mattress she threw gasoline on
By the time he stumbles in, she'll be 50 miles gone
In her second hand Ram, brand new cam
Lotta static on the radio
V8 Hemi, it'll do 120
Blow the black off a blacktop road
She's got a lead foot itchin' for the pedal
And she's tired of livin' with the devil himself
So, she's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
She's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
(She's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell), oh
She'll pin the needle past the redline
Makin' small town headlines
Lookin' for heaven in the headlights
Last seen hammer down westbound
In a second hand Ram, brand new cam
Lotta static on the radio, yeah
V8 Hemi, it'll do 120
Blow the black off a blacktop road
She's got a lead foot itchin' for the pedal
And she's tired of livin' with the devil himself
So, she's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
Yeah, she's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
Yeah, she's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell
(She's gettin' the Dodge outta Hell)
Oh! (ooh-ooh-ooh)
