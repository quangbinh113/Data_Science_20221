Song Name: Remember Her Name
Birds on a wire all fly away
Nobody wanna stand in a hurricane
When everyone else walks away
She'll still remain
When did you lose the girl with no fear?
Oh, she never left
Take a good look
She's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget
Remember the fire, remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name, oh
Don't let go of that wide-eyed innocence
Let that wild child run in the wind
Keep that shine that lights up every room
Hold on to it
Remember the fire, remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name, oh
When did you lose the girl with no fear?
Oh, she never left
Take a good look
She's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget, yeah, oh
Remember the fire, remember her face (remember her face)
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing (remember her laughing)
Through all the pain (through all the pain)
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name
