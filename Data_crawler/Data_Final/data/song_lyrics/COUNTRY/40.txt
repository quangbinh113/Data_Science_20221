Song Name: I Wonder
I said good bye
I drove away
Said I ain't the one
Lied to your face
For 'bout half a mile
All gas no brakes
Thought I was right
My mind was made
Then I see your lipstick on a Starbucks cup
Got me thinkin' I might messed up
Can I live and never kiss those lips again
And I wonder
Years from now
Will I think about how
I shoulda turned around right now
I wonder
Am I gonna regret this
Never gonna forget this
As good as it gets then why am I
Watching her fade in the rearview
Thinkin' bout all we've been through
Oh, will I ever love like I love her
Yeah I wonder
I should feel free
I should feel fine
My head's a wreck
And I ain't all right
What the hell just happened
These white lines keep goin' faster
Every exit that I'm passing'
They all lead straight back to you
Yeah this is weighing heavy
Second thoughts here in this Chevy
Yeah will anybody get me like you do, oh
And I wonder
Years from now
Will I think about how
I shoulda turned around right now
I wonder
Am I gonna regret this
Never gonna forget this
As good as it gets then why am I
Watching her fade in the rearview
Thinkin' bout all we've been through
Oh, will I ever love like I love her
Yeah I wonder
Yeah you looked me in the eyes and told me that I was wrong
Guess you don't know what you really want 'til what you want is gone
Yeah I wonder
Years from now
Will I think about how
I shoulda turned around
And I wonder
Years from now
Will I think about how
I shoulda turned around right now
I wonder
Am I gonna regret this
Never gonna forget this
As good as it gets then why am I
Watching her fade in the rearview
Thinkin' bout all we've been through
Oh, will I ever love like I love her
Yeah I wonder
Yeah I wonder
Watching her fade in the rearview
Thinkin' bout all we've been through
Will I ever love like I love her
Yeah I wonder!
