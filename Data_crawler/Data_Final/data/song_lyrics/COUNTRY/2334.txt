Song Name: Trouble No More
Don't care how long you go
I don't care how long you stay
It's good kind treatment
Bring you home someday
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me, anymore
Yeah, baby
Now you keep on bettin'
That the dice won't pass
Well I know, and I know
Whoa, oh you're livin' too fast
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me, anymore
Yeah
I'll tell everybody
In my neighborhood
You're a kind little woman
But you don't do me no good
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me, anymore
Yeah, hey
I know you're leaving
If you call that's gone
Oh, without my lovin' yeah
Oh, you can't stay long
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me, anymore
Yeah, yeah
Well goodbye baby
Yeah, well take my hand
I don't want no woman, no
Who can't have no man
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me, anymore
Trouble no more
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
