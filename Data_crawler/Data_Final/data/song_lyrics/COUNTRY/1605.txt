Song Name: Miles And Miles Of Texas - Remastered
I was born in Lousiana down on the ol bouyo
Rasied on shrimps and catfish mame's good gumbo
I got the ramblin' fever said goodbye to ma and pa
Crossed that ol red river and this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
I rode up in to Austin the craddle of the west
Just ask any cowboy he'll tell you it's the best
I met a texas bueaty I got friendly with her pa
I looked in to her big blue eyes this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
I started tamin' bronko's I made every rodeo
Until I met a tuff one you know his name was devil joe
I grabb'd hold of his bridle just to ride this ol' outlaw
He threw me from the saddle and this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
Miles of Texas
Uaaah now
All night long
Gonna live here till I die
Aaaaaaaah, Texas
