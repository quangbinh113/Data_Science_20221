Song Name: Change Of Heart
One of these days
You're gonna wake up older
With a hole in your pocket
And a blade on your shoulder
Well, if you break both your legs
Oh, don't come runnin' to me
I've had a change of heart
I've had a change of heart
Don't worry about the war
Nobody's winning
Don't worry about the rain
It's only beginning
I never loved you
And I always will
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
Get down to the end of the line
And it all fell apart
I quit tryin' to change your mind
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
Where are you now
In your pile of rubble
You run from danger
Straight into trouble
Way down deep
You're just as shallow as me
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
An unwanted child
With an absent mother
You want protection
Like an older brother
I end up forgetting
All the words that you said
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
Get down to the end
Of the line
And it all fell apart
I quit tryin' to change the past
I had a change of heart
Oh-oh
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
