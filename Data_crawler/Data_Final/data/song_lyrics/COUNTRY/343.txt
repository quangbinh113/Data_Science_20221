Song Name: Anywhere With You
If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then, baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze
I'll go anywhere, West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair, have you ever seen California?
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at, I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
I'll bet there's a two lane
Runnin' right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
Well, we could send a post card back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime, baby, you say when
I'll go anywhere, West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair, have you ever seen California?
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at, I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
Yeah, I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby, I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California?
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, girl, I'll swear
Just say the word I'll take you there
Anywhere, anywhere with you
Yeah, I'll go anywhere with you
