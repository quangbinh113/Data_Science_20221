Song Name: Six Days On The Road
Well, I pulled out of Pittsburgh, rolling down the eastern seaboard
I've got me diesel wound up and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead but it's all right, I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I got ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm passing little white lines and my eyes are open wide
Just passed a Jimmy and a White, I've been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well, it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lot of women, but I'm not like some of the guys
I could find one to hold me tight, but I could not make believe it's right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well, the ICC is checking on down the line
I'm a little overweight and my log books are way behind
But nothing bothers me tonight, I can dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
My rig's a little old, but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and the smoke's rolling black as coal
My home town's coming in sight, if you think I'm happy, you're right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
