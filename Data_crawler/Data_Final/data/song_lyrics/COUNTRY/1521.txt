Song Name: Abilene
We don't need to talk about Abilene
'Cause Abilene don't mean
No coffee shop, no liquor store
So I don't talk about Abilene no more
Young lovers like to dream
We'll settle down and we'll make a good team
Well, Main Street was cute and
The rents there were cheap
But I was too much for you and for your Abilene
We don't need to talk about Abilene
'Cause Abilene don't mean
No couple acres, no screened in porch
So I don't talk about Abilene no more
I remember the air when I drove out of town
Crying on the highway with my windows down
I'da stayed there forever, 'til death do us part
Texas in my rearview, plains in my heart
Couldn't hold it together when Abilene fell apart
We don't need to talk about Abilene
'Cause Abilene don't mean
No turning the garden, no toys on the floor
So I don't talk about Abilene no more
We don't need to talk about Abilene
'Cause Abilene don't mean
No life that we're building, no weathering storms
That's why I don't talk about Abilene no more
That's why I don't talk about Abilene no more
