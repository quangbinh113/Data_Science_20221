Song Name: Never Wanted To Be That Girl
He helped me change a tire in the Citgo parkin' lot
He said we both could use a beer and I said, "Hell, why not?"
What started out as one night turned to six months just like that
He never had a ring on so I never thought to ask
But then last night I saw a message on his phone
That said, "Hey, babe, what time you comin' home?"
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Bein' the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
Thought I knew who I was, but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl
I heard about those women who didn't have a clue
The ones that made excuses like my mama used to do
And he jumps in the shower just as soon as he gets home
And I spend half an hour goin' through his phone
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Bein' the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was, but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl
Oh, and I feel stupid
I feel cheap
I feel used
I feel weak
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Bein' the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was, but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl
