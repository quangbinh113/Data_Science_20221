Song Name: What's It to You
What's that?
I hear angels singin'
Telling me to make my move
Listen to it
Their voices ringin' baby
If you feel it get in the groove
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you?
Time's up
Train's a leavin' baby
Are you ready to take that ride?
Get on board
Don't keep me waiting baby
Say you're willin' to cross that line
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you?
I'm sure your heart is telling you true
I gotta know what love is to you
'Cause to me, it's the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you?
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you?
I know what love is
What's it to you?
