Song Name: Something Beautiful
Dear Juliet
I heard the story of you and your friend
And I hate to bore you but, oh
It's something beautiful
Dear Romeo
I think I've found one of them girls
From your paper town and, oh
She's something beautiful
Never thought I'd fall, but she caught me
Guess fairytales start when two hearts meet
It don't matter where you're from
Girl, I think that you're the one
So let's take this love and run and run
I, I could dance with you every night
Hold you 'til our fingers intertwine
My love, my love, this is the start
Of something beautiful
Dear Peter Pan
Can lost boys ever be found again?
'Cause sir, I think I've found a home
With something beautiful
Never thought I'd fall, but she caught me
Guess fairytales start when two hearts meet
It don't matter where you're from
Girl, I think that you're the one
So let's take this love and run and run
I, I could dance with you every night
Hold you 'til our fingers intertwine
My love, my love, this is the start
Of something beautiful
Now, all the stories that I've read about
Are happening like gravity I've found
My love, my love, this is the start
Of something beautiful
Dear Mom and Dad
I bought the ring, now I'm gonna ask
Her to marry me and, oh, oh
It's gonna be something beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
I, I could dance with you every night
Hold you 'til our fingers intertwine
My love, my love, this is the start
Of something beautiful
Now, all the stories that I've read about
Are happening like gravity I've found
My love, my love, this is the start
Of something beautiful
