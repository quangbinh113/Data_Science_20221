Song Name: White Liar
Hey, white liar
Truth comes out
A little at a time
An' it spreads
Just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue
LIike turpentine
An' I don't know, why
White liar
You better be careful
What you do
I wouldn't wanna be
In your shoes
If they ever
Found you out
You better be careful
What you say
It never really
Added up anyway
I got friends
In this town
Hey, white liar
Truth comes out
A little at a time
And it spreads
Just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue
Like turpentine
An', I don't know why
White liar
You said you
Went out to a bar
And walked some
Lady to her car
But your face has
More to tell
'Cause my cousin
Saw you on the street
With a red-head
Named Bernice
Turns out
You don't lie, too well
Hey, white liar
Truth comes out
A little at a time
An' it spreads
Just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue
Like turpentine
An' I don't know
Why, white liar
Here's a bombshell
Just for you
Turns out
I've been lying too
Yeah, I'm a white liar
Truth comes out
A little at a time
An' it spreads
Just like a fire
Slips off of my tongue
Like turpentine
An' I don't know
Why, White liar
