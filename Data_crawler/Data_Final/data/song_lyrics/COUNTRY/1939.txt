Song Name: be alright
(It'll be alright)
Lately, I've been gettin' back to the basics
Layin' my roots in the pavement
If haters gonna hate, let 'em hate me, yeah
It ain't easy to build your own fire when it's freezin'
I catch the heat from the summer out of season
But the grind's worth the time, believe me, yeah
Let me tell you now
When you're feeling broken down
You just gotta let it ride
It'll be alright
Smoke it and roll with it
Sip it and flow with it
Wheels on the road with it
Lay back and go with it
Sometimes you'rе high with it
Sometimes you're low with it
But it'll bе alright
Smoke it and roll with it
Sip it and flow with it
Wheels on the road with it
Lay back and go with it
Sometimes you're high with it
Sometimes you're low with it
But it'll be alright
Patience (hey)
Yeah, that's what it's gonna take when (shit)
You're puttin' back the pieces that's been breakin'
When you feel like givin' up stay in, yeah
Let me tell you now
When you're feeling broken down
You just gotta let it ride
It'll be alright
Smoke it and roll with it
Sip it and flow with it
Wheels on the road with it
Lay back and go with it
Sometimes you're high with it
Sometimes you're low with it
But it'll be alright
Yeah, it will
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, it'll be alright
Let me tell you now
When you're feeling broken down
You just gotta let it ride
It'll be alright
Smoke it and roll with it
Sip it and flow with it
Wheels on the road with it
Lay back and go with it
Sometimes you're high with it
Sometimes you're low with it
But it'll be alright
Smoke it and roll with it
Sip it and flow with it
Wheels on the road with it
Lay back and go with it (ooh, yeah)
Sometimes you're high with it
Sometimes you're low with it
But it'll be alright
Yeah, it will
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, it'll be alright, yeah
Woo! (Alright, alright, alright)
It's gonna be alright (alright, alright, alright)
It's gonna be alright (alright, alright)
Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be (it'll be alright)
Gonna be alright, yeah
