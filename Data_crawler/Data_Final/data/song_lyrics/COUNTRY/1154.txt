Song Name: Strawberry Wine
He was workin' through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirstin' for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere
Between a woman and a child
One restless summer
We found love growin' wild
On the banks of the river
On a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love
Whoa, bittersweet
Green on the vine

Like strawberry wine

And I still remember

When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters
And one long distance call
We drifted away
Like the leaves in the fall
But year after year
I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love
Whoa, bittersweet
Green on the vine

Like strawberry wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothin' time hasn't touched
Is it really him
Or the loss of my innocence?
I've been missin' so much
Yeah
Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love
Whoa, bittersweet
And green on the vine
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love
Oh, bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
(Oh, oh)
Strawberry wine
