Song Name: South of Forever
Little faint but the paint ain't wore off the tower
And our names still engraved on the oak out in Dallas
But the pain still hangs like that "Go Cats!" banner
Even rain can't wash away the feeling when I had her
So tell me, if this all that lasts, the memories that we have, I swear that I'll remember
But take me, where heartbreak never shows, where love is all we know when we were Together
Just south of forever
Little late but the weights been holding us down
Mom and dad said some things just ain't working out
The Diamond still shines but the love don't
Her tears fall, as he walks out the door
So tell me, if this all that lasts, the memories that they had, I swear that I'll remember
So take me, where heartbreaks never show, where love is all we know when they were Together
Just south of forever
The years go fast and the days go slow
Cause he ain't here anymore
And here I stand in my best clothes and his name written in the stone
So tell me, if this all that lasts, the memories that we had, I swear that I'll remember
So take me, where heartbreaks never show, where love is all we know when you off to Heaven
Just south of forever
