Song Name: In Love With My Problems (feat. Jon Pardi)
I'm one tall boy short of a buzz
I'm one dollar short of a buck
I'm one amen short of a prayer
I'm one goin' short of goin' somewhere
Yeah, and I could kiss these problems goodbye
If I just started treatin' 'em right
They'd slam the door, pedal to the floor
Suitcase in a two-tone Ford
Flip the bird, say some words
Like they ain't comin' back no more
Maybe that's just what I need
Bettin' they'd get sick of me
Just like you
If I could fall in love with my problems
My problems, my problems
Well, maybe they'd leavе me too
I oughta send four roses, somе flowers tonight
Try to put a ring on a neon light
Start makin' plans and movin' too fast
Yeah, there goes trouble haulin' ass
They'd slam the door, pedal to the floor
Suitcase in a two-tone Ford
Flip the bird, say some words
Like they ain't comin' back no more
Maybe that's just what I need
I'm bettin' they're gettin' sick of me
Yeah, just like you
If I could fall in love with my problems
My problems, my problems
Maybe they'd leave me too
Maybe they'd leave me too
Yeah, and I could kiss these problems goodbye
If I just started treatin' them right
They'd slam the door, pedal to the floor
Suitcase in a two-tone Ford
Flip the bird, say some words
Like they ain't comin' back no more
Maybe that's just what I need
Bettin' they'd get sick of me
Just like you
If I could fall in love with my problems
My problems, my problems
Well, maybe they'd leave me too
Maybe they'd leave me too
