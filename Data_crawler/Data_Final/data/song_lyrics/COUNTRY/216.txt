Song Name: Hard To Love
I am insensitive, I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much,
Sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I dunno why you stay with me?
I'm hard to love, hard to love, oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Mmmm, yeah
I am a short fuse
I am a wreckin' ball crashin' into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday mornin'
Full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you
I'm hard to love, hard to love, oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
Hard to love, hard to love
Oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it If I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me (hard to love, hard to love)
Don't make it easy, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
(Hard to love, hard to love)
You love me good
(Hard to love, hard to love)
Love me good
