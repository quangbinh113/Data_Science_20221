Song Name: I'd Love You to Want Me
When I saw you standing there

I 'bout fell out my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet
Now it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cries
I see the want in your blue eyes
Baby
I'd Love You to Want Me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Baby
You'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
You told yourself years ago

You'd never let your feeling show
The obligation that you made

For the title that they gave
Baby
I'd Love You to Want Me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Baby
You'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
Now it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Now something in my soul just cries
I see the want in your blue eyes
Baby
I'd Love You to Want Me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Baby
You'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
Baby
I'd Love You to Want Me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Baby
You'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
