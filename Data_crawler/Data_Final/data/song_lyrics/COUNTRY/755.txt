Song Name: Millionaire
They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That made me a millionaire
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She is my treasure so very rare
She made me a millionaire
When we ride around
Ride around this old town in my beat up car
With the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say, "That boy is sure livin' in luxury, sweet luxury"
Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I've got love, enough to share
That made me a millionaire
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Life reaches on
A millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I've got love enough to spare
That made me a millionaire
