Song Name: Doing Life With Me
It ain't easy puttin' up with
A road dog with a cup with
A little Jack in it
You talk about the backseat
I don't know, don't ask me
How she sat in it
She carried my burdens and paid my bail
Put a Tennessee breeze in my Carolina sail
And set me free
I don't pray much anymore
For this old troubadour's
Happiness, wishes, wants and needs
End of my ropes, hopes and dreams
Spend my livin' giving thanks
For the ships I never sank
Every big, every little in the every day things
The notes and the words and the songs I sing
To the ones doing life with me
Coulda easily said goodbye to
This runaway train you're tied to
I know I don't get it
Baby, how you roll with it
The fists and the fights and the scars of the battle
The ups and the downs of the judge's gavel
How'd you wind up in my unravel?
I don't pray much anymore
For this old troubadour's
Happiness, wishes, wants and needs
End of my ropes, hopes and dreams
Spend my livin' giving thanks
For the ships I never sank
Every big, every little in the every day things
The notes and the words and the songs I sing
To the ones doing life with me
You're my faith in the grace every sunrise brings
Set me free
I don't pray much anymore
For this old troubadour's
Happiness, wishes, wants and needs
End of my ropes, hopes and dreams
Spend my livin' giving thanks
For the ships I never sank
You're my faith in the grace every sunrise brings
Every big, every little in the every day things
The notes and the words and the songs I sing
To the ones doing life with me
