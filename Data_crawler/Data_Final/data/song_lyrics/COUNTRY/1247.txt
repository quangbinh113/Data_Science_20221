Song Name: Chasing After You (with Maren Morris)
You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
Then I wake up with you on my chest
You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool, mm, mm
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you, mm, mm, yeah
Listen
Wish I could quit you, but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would
But somethin' 'bout you makes me think we could
Make it after all
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you
You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool
Yeah, every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you
I love chasing after you
Ooh, ooh
