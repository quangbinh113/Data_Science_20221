Song Name: Homesick
Guitars ring through the dead of night
Sing so blue sound so right
Make You Homesick
Listen close to the guitar man
A native son in a foreign land
The boy is homesick
He's homesick for days back home
Homesick for home, sweet home
Yes, he is
Where were you in '69?
Smokin' dope and drinkin' wine
Just a outlaw
Distant drums beat an old refrain
Shakes the feet pounds the brain
Like a buzzsaw
That's alright
In the darkness down the hall
Blacklight posters on the wall
Jimi Hendrix
Someone's lost in yesterday
Hazey dreams of Monterey... and Woodstock
Homesick four days gone by
Homesick to kiss the sky
Oh, don't you know the boy's homesick?
Yeah, take it home
Listen to it, take me home
Oh, don't you know the boy's homesick?
Guitars ring through the dead of night
Sing so blue sound so right
Makes you homesick
Listen close to the guitar man
A native son in a forgein land
The boy is homesick
He's homesick for days back home
Homesick for home, sweet home
Yeah, yeah
Lord, don't you know the boy is homesick?
Yeah
Listen to it, listen to it
Oh, won't you listen to him
Yeah
