Song Name: Reason For Leaving
Your mom said I'm the one years ago
You know the colors I want at our wedding
Lately you're acting like
I'm someone you don't know
I can't take all this second guessing
You see the clouds in the sky
You find the dark in the light
Boy don't you do this tonight
We've been through this a million times
Are you just waiting on some night
When I say goodbye outta nowhere
Or wondering when you'll catch me
Kissin' somebody else somewhere
Boy I ain't lying when I tell ya
That I'm in love
After everything saying it should be enough
I ain't gonna beg you to believe it
If you're just looking for a reason for leaving
Well maybe you already got one
If you're scared it's gonna break my heart
Just start 'cause waiting only makes it worse
I can take my whole world falling apart
But I can't be the one to say it first
Are you just waiting on some night
When I say goodbye outta nowhere
Or wondering when you'll catch me
Kissin' somebody else somewhere
Boy I ain't lying when I tell ya
That I'm in love
After everything saying it should be enough
I ain't gonna beg you to believe it
If you're just looking for a reason for leaving
Or maybe you already got one
Oh you already got your
Mind made up, what are you waiting for
Baby just walk out the door
If you're just waiting on some night
When I say goodbye outta nowhere
Or wondering when you'll catch me
Kissin' somebody else somewhere
Boy I ain't lying when I tell ya
That I'm in love
After everything saying it should be enough
I ain't gonna beg you to believe it
If you're just looking for a reason for leaving
Maybe you already got one
Ooh, maybe you already got one
Ooh yeah you do
