Song Name: Colder Weather
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights
Shinin' through the window pane
He said, "I wanna see you again"
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, "You're a ramblin' man"
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And then waitress' eyes
He sees the same ol' light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado
And the girl he left behind him
He said, "I wanna see you again"
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, "You're a ramblin' man"
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin' (born for leavin')
Well it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover I'm a runner
And we go round 'n round
And I love you but I leave ya
I don't want you but I need ya
You know it's you that calls me back here baby
Oh, I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
(I ain't ever gonna change)
I gotta gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'
When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
With your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then
