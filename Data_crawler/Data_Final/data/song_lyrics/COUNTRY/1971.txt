Song Name: Friends Don't Let Friends
Alright
Ooh-ooh
I got a buddy livin' out in Jacksonville
In love with a woman with looks to kill
Who called me outta the blue just the other night
Yeah, he was gonna put a diamond on her hand
Then he caught her runnin' 'round with another man
So I booked me a ticket for the early A.M. flight
That's right
You know friends don't let friends drink alone
Gotta have a little help to get that memory gone
If you gonna make a bad decision, you shouldn't make it on your own
Yeah, friends don't let friends drink alone
No, they don't
Well, I got another buddy in Birmingham
Got cut loose by the old bossman
Said hе's like a bull headed for the nеon lights
Oh, he's gonna need someone to pick up the tab
Talk it out, maybe split a cab
Tell 'em everything's gonna be right
Yeah, that's right
You know friends don't let friends drink alone
And gonna let 'em sit around and listen to them old sad songs (them old sad songs)
If you gonna make a bad decision, you shouldn't make it on your own
Yeah, friends don't let friends drink alone
No, they don't
Hey, listen
If you need a wingman
If you need a wingman
I can hold a cold can
I can hold a cold can
I'll pick up the phone, man
I won't leave you hangin' out to dry
Buddy, I can split a twelve-pack
Yeah, that's right
I won't leave you by yourself, Jack
No, sir
You know I got your back
And I know you got mine, yeah (woo)
You know friends don't let friends drink alone
It takes a couple good old boys to tie one home
Oh, if you gonna make a bad decision, you shouldn't make it on your own
No, friends don't let friends drink alone
Friends don't let friends (friends, friends) drink alone
Woo
No, they don't
Oh, no, they don't (no, they don't)
You know they don't
Don't let friends drink alone
Drink alone
Dial my number, buddy, I'll pick up
I'll come help you catch that bus
'Cause friends don't let friends drink alone
Save that empty stool for me
I'll come runnin' in one, two, three (one, two, three)
'Cause friends don't let friends drink alone
