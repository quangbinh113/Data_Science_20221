Song Name: Us
Like starry skies and fireflies will always be summer
Like amen and church, can't have one without the other
Like dive bars and smoke, yeah, everybody knows
Like long nights and sunrise will always mean memories
New Years and Champagne will mean one too many
Like dirt roads and dust
You and me will always be us
Like comin' home headlights always means your truck
Like leanin' in's always gonna mean
My red wine lips mixed with your whiskey kiss Friday nights
Like your right hand's always gonna be in mine
Some things just fit perfectly
Like an old t-shirt and Levi jeans
You and me will always be us
Like two kids and diamond rings will always mean crazy
Like stupid fights and I know I'm right means, I'm sorry, baby
Like young love grows up
You and me will always be us
Like comin' home headlights always means your truck
Like leanin' in's always gonna mean
My red wine lips mixed with your whiskey kiss Friday nights
Like your right hand's always gonna be in mine
Some things just fit perfectly
Like an old t-shirt and Levi jeans
You and me will always be us, yeah
Some things don't hold up
They fade and they rust
But this ain't that, baby
You and me will always be us
Like comin' home headlights always means your truck
Like leanin' in's always gonna mean
My red wine lips mixed with your whiskey kiss Friday nights
Like your right hand's always gonna be in mine
Some things just fit perfectly
Like an old t-shirt and Levi jeans
You and me will always be us
Us
