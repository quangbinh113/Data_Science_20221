Song Name: Trailer Park
I got plates from Carolina
I got one from Tennessee
And I'm one chrome hitch away
From bein' where I wanna be
I got vagabonds and old ex-cons
A beer can's throw away
Like a castle up on 12-inch block
And pride underneath the paint
Even though I keep my love like a satellite
I still never get that picture right
I'm driftin' into outer space
And my hangin' hat don't stay
I ran like hell from wedding bells
And I rambled my whole life
I left a breadcrumb trail of shotgun shells
And I'm still damn hard to find
I'm up and gone and rollin' on
Before that shootin' starts
I got a mind runnin' like a freight train
And a heart and a heart like a trailer park
Yeah, I got troubled souls and tornadoes
Both feel right at home
I got more tattoos than the prisons do
And stories left untold
That neon up above me
It flickers on and off
But the landlord, he still loves me
'Cause he and I still talk
Even though I doubled down in double-wides
And two wrongs just don't make it right
Love don't last here very long
And if it does, well, I'm movin' on
I ran like hell from wedding bells
And I rambled my whole life
I left a breadcrumb trail of shotgun shells
And I'm still damn hard to find
I'm up and gone and rollin' on
Before that shootin' starts
I got a mind runnin' like a freight train
And a heart and a heart like a trailer park
I keep my love like a satellite
I still never get that picture right
And I'm driftin' into outer space
And my hangin' hat don't stay
I ran like hell from wedding bells
And I rambled my whole life
I left a breadcrumb trail of shotgun shells
And I'm still damn hard to find (still damn hard to find)
I'm up and gone and rollin' on
Before that shootin' starts
I got a mind runnin' like a freight train
And a heart and a heart like a trailer park
And a heart like a trailer park
