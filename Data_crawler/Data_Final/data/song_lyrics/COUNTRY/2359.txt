Song Name: Don't Misunderstand Me
Oh well I know where you're goin', I see where you've been
Don't you know by now, you've got to take life on the chin
Still you sit and wonder, why the past is gone
Baby you'll go under if you don't carry on
Don't misunderstand me, I realize it ain't easy to take
But you been hidin', and I been ridin' like the wind to find you
Hey... just you
I don't need no promises, just tell me the truth
Mister keep it honest that's all I ask of you
Don't be second guessin' 'bout where you gonna be
Baby count your blessin's, 'cause you won't find one like me
Don't misunderstand me, I realize it ain't easy to take
But you been hidin', I been ridin' like the wind to find you
Well now lady get your dress on, grab them fancy shoes
Honey I'm ready, and waitin' on you
Time is surely wastin', we've so much to do
We're both too smart to be fakin'
And I know it doesn't matter which road you take
Or is it your way or my way
Well then lady let me tell you what we're gonna do, uh-huh
We're gonna ride every highway
Don't misunderstand me, babe I realize it aint easy to take
But you been hidin', and I been ridin' like the wind to find you
To find you... to find you... to find you... to find you
