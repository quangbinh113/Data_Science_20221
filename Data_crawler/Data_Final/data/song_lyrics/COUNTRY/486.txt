Song Name: Neon Moon
When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feelin'
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar
Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon
Now If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
He'll come back someday
Ooh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
Ooh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
So watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end
Ooh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
Ooh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Ooh, watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
