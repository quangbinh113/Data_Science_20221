Song Name: American Ride
Winter getting colder, summer gettin' warmer
Tidal wave come 'cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon? It's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Mama gets her box off watchin' "Desperate Housewives"
Daddy works his ass off payin' for the good life
Kids on the Youtube learnin' how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pound and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note
Plasma gettin' bigger, Jesus gettin' smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, the fit's gonna hit the shan
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Hot dog, hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh yeah
Na na, na na na na
Na na, na na na na
Na na, na na na na
Na na na na na
