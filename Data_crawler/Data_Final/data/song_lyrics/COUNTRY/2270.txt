Song Name: Shut Up And Drive
Shut up and drive
You don't know what you're talking about
He's not the one
You ought to know that by now
You've got one of those hearts
That keeps changing your mind
Your heart has a way of making you stay
So shut up and drive
Don't look in the mirror
He might have that look in his eyes
The one that's so strong
It strangles your will to survive
He's mastered the art
Of looking sincere
His eyes have a way of making you stay
Don't look in the mirror
I'm the voice you never listened to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one that will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man that you wanted him to be
Turn the radio on
To drown out the sound of goodbye
And blink back the tears
Show me you still have your pride
Just get yourself lost
In a sad country song
Those guys that they play
Know just what to say
So turn the radio on
I'm the voice you never listened to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man that you wanted him to be
Shut up and drive
Don't look in the mirror
Turn the radio on
And get out of here
Shut up and drive
Mmmmm... ooooooh...
Shut up and drive
Oooooh... oh...
Oooh... shut up and drive
