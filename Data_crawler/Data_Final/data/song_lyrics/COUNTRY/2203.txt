Song Name: Tell Me Why
Everywhere I look, the sun is shining
But it's always raining here inside
I can see you really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love with a flame that never dies
Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
Everywhere I go, you're in my shadow
When I turn around, there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared
So, won't you tell me why?
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why?
Ask anyone you know and they'll say love fades away
But this heart's crying just like yesterday
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared
So, won't you tell me why?
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why?
I can't say goodbye
