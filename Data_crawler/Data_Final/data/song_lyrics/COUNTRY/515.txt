Song Name: We Danced Anyway
The summer air was heavy and sweet
You and I on a crowded street
I can see us there
In a happy little foreign town
Where the stars hung upside down
Far, far away
I remember you were laughing
We were so in love
And the band played
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh
La la la la la la la la
And we danced anyway
Well they say you can't go back
But baby I don't believe that
Come on and dance with me
Well maybe if I hold you close
Baby we could just let go
We'll come back around
You remember we were laughing
So in love
And the band played
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh
La la la la la la la la
And we danced anyway
Instrumental
You remember we were laughing
We were so in love
We were so in love
And the band played songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
Never understood the words
We just sang oh
La la la la la la la la
La la la la oh ohhhhh
Ohhhh ohhhh
And we danced anyway
(Ohh we were dancing ohh)
Ooohhhhhh
We danced anyway
(Ohh we were dancing ohh)
