Song Name: Hard Out Here For A Country Boy
Well, it's hard out here for a country boy
Chugging that cold beer, loving that hot girl
Living that slow life in a real fast world
Gonna be a long day, but I'll get through it
It's a hell of a job, but somebody gotta do it
It's hard out here for a country boy
Woo-wee, yeah, it's hard out here
Turn four Talladega second time this year
Lifting this koozie's got my arm tired
Sweating and getting this old boy wired
NASCAR, bikini tan lines
Coppertone shoulders, sunshine
It's tough for a red, white, and blue collared guy
Well, it's hard out here for a country boy (Hell yeah)
Chugging that cold beer, loving that hot girl
Living that slow life in a real fast world
It's hard out here for a country boy (Hell yeah)
Riding them Goodyears, reeling them Big Cats
Wearing this red neck like an old ball cap
Gonna be a long day, but I'll get through it
It's a hell of a job, but somebody gotta do it
It's hard out here for a country boy
Naw, sir, we ain't worried about it
When it comes to fun, we know our way around it
Man, we smoking that smoke on a back porch swing
While the hound dog chews on a chicken wing
It's hard out here for a country boy (Hell yeah)
Chugging that cold beer, loving that hot girl
Living that slow life in a real fast world
It's hard out here for a country boy (Hell yeah)
Riding them Goodyears, reeling them Big Cats
Wearing this red neck like an old ball cap
Gonna be a long day, but I'll get through it
It's a hell of a job, but somebody gotta do it
It's hard out here for a country boy
Well, it's hard out here for a country boy
