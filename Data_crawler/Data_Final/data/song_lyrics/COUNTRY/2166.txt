Song Name: it won't always be this way
Speak of the devil in he walks
It's like his ears burn when I talk
Pushed in a gutter, stuck in a rut
Waiting for the next turn of the knife in my gut
Just trying to do whatever
To somehow make myself feel better
But I guess I've got you to thank
Broken like the bottle that you drank
But it won't always be this way
It won't always be this way
Don't know how many times I'll say
It won't always be this way
Feels like I'm drowning in a dream
With a breath of air just out of my reach
And I'm kicking as hard as I can
God, I wish you were a better man
It won't always be this way
It won't always be this way
Don't know how many times I'll say
It won't always be this way
So don't you cry my little one
Don't talk about what your daddy done
Like a bird, we'll fly away someday
I promise I'll plan our getaway
It won't always be this way
It won't always be this way
Don't know how many times I'll say
It won't always be this way
Don't know how many times I'll say
It won't always be this way
It won't always be this way
It won't always be this way
Don't know how many times I'll say
It won't always be this way
Got down on my knees to pray
It won't always be this way
Cause my new life starts today
It won't always be this way
