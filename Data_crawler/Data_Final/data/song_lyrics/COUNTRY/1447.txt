Song Name: First Dirt Road
We were Copenhagen kings, we were running that town
In a hand me down truck I could see us now
Blowing them reds, throwing longnecks
At the county line sign
Wasn't no such thing as a no trespass
Twenty four of Coors and a half tank of gas
Every Friday night you knew where to find us at
On that 2.5 miles of dirt
Yeah, we were raised on it
Wrote our names on it
Put some mud on our trucks when it rained on it
Kicked the dust on it
Fell in love on it
Got our hearts broke, learned how to cuss on it
Like every smoke was the best one rolled,
Like every beer was the last one cold,
Like it was the first dirt road
Wasn't doing nothing Dad and Grandaddy didn't do
But that long drive of gravel felt pretty damn new
Like it was made for us, thought we were dangerous
Hellbent on never growing up
Yeah, we were raised on it
Wrote our names on it
Put some mud on our trucks when it rained on it
Kicked the dust on it
Fell in love on it
Got our hearts broke, learned how to cuss on it
Like every smoke was the best one rolled,
Like every beer was the last one cold,
Like it was the first dirt road
Like it was the first dirt road
Now it's just another stretch of asphalt
If they could only see what's underneath
Yeah, we were raised on it
Wrote our names on it
Put some mud on our trucks when it rained on it
Kicked the dust on it
Fell in love on it
Got our hearts broke, learned how to cuss on it
Yeah, we were raised on it
Wrote our names on it
Put some mud on our trucks when it rained on it
Kicked the dust on it
Fell in love on it
Got our hearts broke, learned how to cuss on it
Like every smoke was the best one rolled,
Like every beer was the last one cold,
Like it was the first dirt road
Like it was the first dirt road
Yeah like it was the first dirt road
