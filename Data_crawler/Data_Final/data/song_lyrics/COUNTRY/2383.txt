Song Name: Labels
Well, she's a loner
She'll never let you on the inside
Yeah, he's a stoner
Lost behind red eyes
You're a drunk if you're leanin' on the back wall
You a player if you take her after last call
I wonder what you see when you look at me, yeah
'Cause nobody wants to be labeled
You can't judge a record by its cover
'Til you hear it spinnin' on the turntable
There's always more behind the title
One man's enemy's another man's brother
One man's ex is another man's lover
We try to peel 'em off like a brand on a bottle
'Cause nobody wants to be labeled (Yeah)
Nobody wants to be labeled (Uh)
Prom queen's got a nine-month secret
He's got a boyfriend, but he prays to Jesus
It's gettin' harder to hide, so they hit the light
So nobody can see 'em
Nobody wants to be labeled
You can't judge a record by its cover
'Til you hear it spinnin' on the turntable
There's always more behind the title
One man's enemy's another man's brother
One man's ex is another man's lover
We try to peel 'em off like a brand on a bottle
'Cause nobody wants to be labeled (Yeah)
Nobody wants to be labeled
Well, you come into the world with a new tattoo
Little red, little white, little black, little blue (Yeah)
Oh, you come into the world with your own tattoo
But nobody wants to be labeled (Yeah)
'Cause nobody wants to be labeled
You can't judge a record by its cover
'Til you hear it spinnin' on the turntable
There's always more behind the title
One man's enemy's another man's brother
One man's ex is another man's lover
We try to peel 'em off like a brand on a bottle
'Cause nobody wants to be labeled (Yeah)
Nobody wants to be labeled (Alright)
