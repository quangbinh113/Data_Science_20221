Song Name: Small Town Boy
I'm a dirt road
In the headlights
I'm a mama's boy
I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line
Kinda cold beer
Little hat down
Little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see that girl standin' right there
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'll turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants to be
Anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance
To some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
I ain't scared to get all up in them fire lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough
Of a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'll turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants to be
Anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me, yeah
Yeah, I'm her sure thing
I'm her go to
I'm her rock star
She ain't gon' ever lose
Small town boy like me
I'm her ride or die baby
I'm her cool, I'm her crazy
I'm her laid back in the front seat
I'm so with you 'til the end girl
Let's turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants to be
Anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'll turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants to be
Anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me
Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me
