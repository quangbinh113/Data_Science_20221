Song Name: hookup scene
This hookup scene
Ain't all that it's made out to be
You get your fill and leave empty
More lonely than before
And you lay beside
Somebody you know isn't right
I make believe it's love, then I
Start lookin' for the door
If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite, the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad
A pretty face
Might get you far
But still it can't replace
The kind of real connection that I crave
The kind we don't have anymore
And I get in my head
Analyzing what I had
It's a chapter that ain't coming back
I could have learned to love it more
So if you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite the way they make you sad
'Cause I wish I would have known we didn't have it so bad, hmm
I wish I would have known I didn't have it so bad
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
