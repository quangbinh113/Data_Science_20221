Song Name: Small Town Friday Nights
It's a one red light town whose back roads are ours
And we got our names up on that water tower
Some things 'round here, they don't ever change
Like waking up and working hard and know when to chase down
Those good times
Flying down the road under the moonlight
To the place we always go
Where the bonfire high
Meets the stars and the sky
Yeah living our lives for these small town Friday nights
We pass it round and we throw it back
You can't stop that buzz when we do it like that
Put that weekend to dust, tonight's about us
Yeah we've got our own way of turning it up
With the good times
Flying down the road under the moonlight
To the place we always go
Getting wild in the dark
Just young crazy hearts
Going too far
Yeah we take this two lane way out
When no one else can find us
Got these four wheels
And that county line behind us
Where the bonfire high
Meets the stars and the sky
Yeah living our lives for these small town Friday nights
Good times
Flying down the road under the moonlight
To the place we always go
Getting wild in the dark
Just young crazy hearts
Going too far
Yeah we take this two lane way out
When no one else can find us
Got these four wheels
And that county line behind us
Where the bonfire high
Meets the stars and the sky
Yeah living our lives for these small town Friday nights
Something 'bout that freedom
That backroad dust
That 2 am blow
Just doing it our way
The way country hits
Let some damn home on it
I wish every night was a small town Friday night
