Song Name: Tell Me It Is
I don't wanna leave this room
Even if the sun comes up
'Cause everything out that window's collapsin'
And burnin' and crashin' in on us
We kill the lights
Lean in and kiss me slow
It's like nothin' is broken
As long as I'm layin' here, holdin' you close
Everything's not okay, but you tell me it is
If you tell me it is, I'll believe you
Tell me what to say, I don't know what to fix
Is it worth all of this? God, I need you to tell me it is
It always feels way too soon
When I gotta let you go
When everything's toxic, it takes you to stop it
Baby, you're my only antidote
Everything's not okay, but you tell me it is
If you tell me it is, I'll believe you
Tell me what to say, I don't know what to fix
Is it worth all of this? God, I need you to tell me it is
Tell me it is
Why don't you lie with me
A little bit longer and tell me the worst is over?
Say anything
Just keep the world movin' slower
'Cause everything's not okay, but you tell me it is
If you tell me it is, I'll believe you
And tell me what to say, I don't know what to fix
Is it worth all of this? God, I need you to tell me it is
Oh, yeah
Tell me it is, mm
Tell me it is, oh yeah
Tell me it is
Everything's not okay, but you tell me it is
If you tell me it is, I'll believe you
