Song Name: Made in America
My old man's that old man
Spent his life livin' off the land
Dirty hands, and a clean soul
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton he didn't grow
He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
Simplified tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says USA
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudice, he's just, made in America
He loves his wife and she's that wife
That decorates on the Fourth of July
But says every day's Independence Day
She's golden rule, teaches school,
Some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway
He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
Simplified tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says USA
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudice, he's just, made in America
Born in the Heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam
He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
Simplified tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says USA
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix,
With WD40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudice, he's just, made in America

Made in America
Made in America
My old man's that old man
Made in America
