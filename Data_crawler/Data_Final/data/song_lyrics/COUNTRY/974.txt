Song Name: Girl Goin' Nowhere
Don't waste your life behind that guitar
You may get goin', but you won't get far
You're not the first, and won't be the last
And you can tell us all about it when you come crawling back
That road you're on, just winds and winds
You're spinning your wheels and wasting your time
But when the lights come up, and I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am
I hear the crowd, I look around
And I can't find an empty chair
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere
I get these calls, out on the road
Heard your song on my radio
We always said you'd make it big
And I tell all my friends, I knew you back when
So don't forget all us little folks
And when you crash and burn
Remember we told you so
And then the lights come up, and I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am
I hear the crowd, I look around
And I can't find one empty chair
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere
I need to thank my daddy
For that first set of strings
And all those folks who swore I'd never be anything
It took a whole lot of "yes I wills" and "I don't cares"
A whole lot of basement dives and county fairs
To this show right now and y'all sure look good out there
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere
