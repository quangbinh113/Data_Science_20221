Song Name: Unlonely Me
Yeah, I know it's late, are you still awake? Is it just as empty there as it is at my place?
Would it be weird if you came over here and made this rainy day chardonnay just disappear?
Don't wanna complicate it, I know love has made us jaded
And I know we're only friends, but I'ma go ahead and say it
Unlonely me, unmess my mess
Unlock that door, unwreck my head
Unbreak my heart, unmake my bed
Just stay, don't leave, unlonely me
Ooh
Ooh
Are you on your way? Are we on the same page?
Am I sayin' something we just both been scared to say?
Don't wanna make it hard, but I'm falling all apart
And if I was where you are, would you wrap me in your arms? Then
Unlonely me, unmess my mess
Unlock that door, unwreck my head
Unbreak my heart, unmake my bed
Just stay, don't leave, unlonely me
Ooh (unlonely me)
Ooh (unlonely me)
Ooh
Ooh
Don't wanna complicate it, I know love has made us jaded
And I know we're only friends, but I'ma go ahead and say it
Unlonely me, unmess my mess
Unlock that door, unwreck my head
Unbreak my heart, unmake my bed
Just stay, don't leave, unlonely me
Unlonely (ooh)
Unlonely
Unlonely (ooh)
Unlonely me, oh (ooh)
Oh, baby, unlonely me (ooh)
