Song Name: A Cowgirl Like You
A Sky full of stars
A saddle for a pillow
Whistlin' wind on the range
Smell of mesquite
From a Cracklin' fire glowin' soft
And his coffee to drink
Cowboy's are rugged, they're wild and they're tough
All the stories they tell are all true
But a cowboy ain't nothin till he's loved by a cowgirl like you
You're that sip of Anejo
In a dusty old bar
At the end of a long lonesome trail
You're that first taste of freedom
First breathe of fresh air
To an outlaw just outta jail
You're the dream I had someday
Of that nail by the doorway
I could hang this ole hat on to
No a cowboy ain't nothin till he's loved by a cowgirl like you
These wide-open spaces ain't meant for wanderin' alone
With you right beside me that old desperado feelin' inside me is gone
Now when I look in your eyes
And see the rest of my life
There ain't a sunset worth ridin' into
A cowboy ain't nothin' till he's loved by a cowgirl like you
These wide-open spaces ain't meant for wanderin' alone
With you right beside me that old desperado feelin' inside me is gone
When I look in your eyes
And see the rest of my life
There ain't a sunset worth ridin' into
A cowboy ain't nothin' till he's loved by a cowgirl like you
No a cowboy ain't nothin' till he's loved by a cowgirl like you
