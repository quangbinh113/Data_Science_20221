Song Name: A Life Where We Work Out (feat. Kaitlin Butts)
In a life where we work out there's a house upon a hill
A front porch going all of the way round and a
Flower pot on the windowsill
We sit and watch the sunset while the kids play in the field
'Cause in a life where we work out, there's a house upon a hill
I still call you darlin', you still call me babe
I smile in the mirror when I say my new last name
You take me out dancin' on the weekend that
You don't sing
'Cause in a life where we work out, you still call me babe
Life is only Ups and Downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become
Lord knows I can't keep losing sleep dreaming about
A life where we work out
Our love's still hotter than a Texas summer day
You still bite your lip when I look at you in that way.
We pull off on some old dirt road on the way home
'Cause we can't wait
'Cause in a life
Where we work out, our love's hotter than
A summer day
Life is only Ups and Downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become
Lord knows I can't keep losing sleep dreaming about
A life where we work out
A life where we work out
