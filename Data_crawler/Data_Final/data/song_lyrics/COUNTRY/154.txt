Song Name: Beautiful Crazy
Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine
Takes forever gettin' ready
So she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
And she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
And says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
She's crazy
She's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me
