Song Name: Denim & Diamonds
I thought about it for a long time
Wondering how I might let you go
I started counting up all my little problems
And the doors that I should probably close
Well it turns out things aren't exactly what they seem
So, I might as well say what I mean
Well, here we go
I can do whatever I wanna
All by my lonesome
If that's a problem, well, you can't say shit
'Cause I'm going my way
Livin' and dyin'
And I can buy my own damn denim and diamonds
My boss called me up said, "If you don't tow the line or be on time
You'll need a line of your own"
So, I did the math and I chose the path of least resistance and I
Simply hung up the phone
And that was the last day that I ever got paid to do something
That didn't make sense
That's when it clicked
I can do whatever I wanna all by my lonesome
If that's a problem, well, you can't say shit
'Cause I'm going my way
Livin' and dyin'
And I can buy my own damn denim and diamonds
I can buy my own damn denim and diamonds
I can buy my own damn, damn, damn
So, girls if you're feeling worn out
A little unsure
Trying to make it all on your own
Well, just remember what Cher says
"Mom, I am a rich man
Ain't scared to go it all alone"
'Cause I can do whatever I wanna
All by my lonesome
If that's a problem well you can't say shit
'Cause I'm going my way
Livin' and dyin'
And I can buy my own damn denim and diamonds
I can buy my own damn denim and diamonds
I can buy my own damn, damn, damn
