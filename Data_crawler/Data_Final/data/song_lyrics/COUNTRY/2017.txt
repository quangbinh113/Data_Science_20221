Song Name: Tabasco & Sweet Tea
Every kiss, a hundred thousand degrees
Burn it up, burn it up, weak in the knees
That good heat, mm, yeah
Every touch, ice cream
I'm talkin' Blue Bell, hot fudge you know what I mean
That good sweet, mm, oh
She's hotter than Tabasco
I'm talkin' barefoot, black top down in Daytona
Such a Southern little sizzle, you could fry an egg on her
Well, she's sweeter than the sweet tea
That mamaw made, straight sugar water
Makes me wanna lay her down and put some sugar on her
When God made my baby, well, he must've been a-rockin'
That bartender upstairs made onе hell of a concoction for me
She Tabasco and sweet tеa
Yeah, well she's spicy like that jerky got from Buc-ee's down in Texas
So delightful like that coconut a-hanging in my Lexus
Not that new car smell, I'm talkin' Tropicana, yeah
She got a mean little temper like a pitbull on a chain
But when she loves, she loves like that sugar cane
And I can tell this shit is forever, yeah (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Oh, yeah, she's hotter than Tabasco
I'm talkin' barefoot, black top down in Daytona
Such a Southern little sizzle, you could fry an egg on her
Well, she's sweeter than the sweet tea
That mamaw made, straight sugar water
Makes me wanna lay her down and put some sugar on her
When God made my baby, well, he must've been a-rockin'
That bartender upstairs made one hell of a concoction for me
She Tabasco and sweet tea
Oh yeah, she's hotter than Tabasco
I'm talkin' barefoot, black top down in Daytona
Such a Southern little sizzle, you could fry an egg on her
Well, she's sweeter than the sweet tea
That mamaw made, straight sugar water
Makes me wanna lay her down and put some sugar on her
When God made my baby, well, he must've been a-rockin'
That bartender upstairs made one hell of a concoction for me
She Tabasco and sweet tea
You better stop that girl
