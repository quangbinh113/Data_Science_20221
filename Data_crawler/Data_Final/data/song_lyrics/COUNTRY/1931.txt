Song Name: Nervous
You make me nervous
Put my reservations out of service
Making me feel like every secret's worth it, it's workin'
I'm tryna hide my desire below the surface
You make me wonder
How this part of me went undiscovered?
Takin' my heart out of its zone of comfort, like Summer
By the time that it's gone, you want another
You make me out of control
Out of our clothes, motion in slow, yeah
You take me, you take me in my feelings
Through thе ceiling
Leaving my inhibitions exposеd
You make me nervous
Every little move you make, you make on purpose
Tracing my body like you're learning cursive
Researching, just how high your touch can take a person
You make me out of control
Out of our clothes, motion in slow, yeah
You take me, you take me in my feelings
Through the ceiling
Leaving my inhibitions exposed
You make me nervous!
You make me out of control
Out of our clothes, motion in slow, yeah
You take me, you take me in my feelings
Through the ceiling
Leaving my inhibitions exposed
You make me nervous
Put my reservations out of service
I'm tryna hide my desire below the surface
You make me nervous
