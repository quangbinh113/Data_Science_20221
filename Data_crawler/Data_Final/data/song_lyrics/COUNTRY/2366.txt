Song Name: Climb to Safety
You can hear, hear it comin'
Like a train out of control
Surely leaves you wonderin'
Exactly where your ticket goes
Scream at the conductor
He's been deaf for 20 years
Hear the other people laughin'
As he grinds through every gear
Go to grab your nerve, you find that its been missin'
Seems you've lost your faith in everyone you know
Well, I surely hope that you don't plan on winnin'
Better start payin' more attention to the ones that throw you clear
You are seconds from the impact, they were movin' way too slow
You say time will surely mold you
Into something you don't like
Now you're runnin' like a rabbit
Stick your finger in the dike
Look around your room, you find the paint is peelin'
Your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones
Well, I must admit I know just how you're feelin'
Must grab each others collar, must rise out of the water
'Cause you know as well as I do that it's no fun to die alone
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters (climb to safety)
You never left me in the dark here on my own (climb to safety)
I can hear the water rising, let me be your ladder (climb to safety)
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone
You tell me love, has always scared you
Like the things under your bed
Baby, we can walk on water
Like some junkies swore they did
You call me on the phone, you say that it is crucial
Stick your fingers in your ears 'til they explode
I guess business, and it rolls along as usual
Must grab each others collar, rise out of the water
'Cause you know as well as I do that it's no fun to die alone
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters (climb to safety)
You never left me in the dark here on my own (climb to safety)
I can hear the water rising, let me be your ladder (climb to safety)
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone (climb to safety)
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters (climb to safety)
You never left me in the dark here on my own (climb to safety)
I can hear the water rising, let me be your ladder (climb to safety)
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone
Yeah-yeah, climb to safety
Oh-oh, climb to safety (safety)
Yeah-yeah, climb to safety
