Song Name: When It's My Time
When it's my time, I'm gonna go
There is no reason for me to stay
I did all the dancin' that could have been done
I would have been gone anyway
I lived my life the way that I wanted
Some folks agree, other folks don't
I believe in Heaven, I believe in love
I believe it can't change the plan made above
So when it's my time, I'm gonna go
There is no reason for me to stay
I did all the dancin' that could have been done
I would have been gone anyway
It ain't been easy goin' this long
Ridin' the fine line between right and wrong
But I been livin', I fought tooth and nail
I walked the high road and given it hell, yeah
When it's my time, I'm gonna go
There is no reason for me to stay
I did all the dancin' that could have been done
I would have been gone anyway
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right where I stand, between you and me
I can weather the storm, I don't mind the rain
The day that I'm gone, I'll be feelin' no pain
Oh, when it's my time, I'm gonna go
There is no reason for me to stay
I did all the dancin' that could have been done
I would have been gone anyway
When it's my time, I'm gonna go
There is no reason for me to stay
I done did all the dancin' that could have been done
I would have been gone anyway
