Song Name: To Be Loved By You
Hell, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Finding out why shouldn't take this long
Easier said than done, I guess
I'm a little bit harder to love than the rest
Why does this have to be so hard?
Doing my best to hold your heart
And I, I'll never let it go again
So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?
What in the hell does a man
Have to do, to be loved by you?
Well I've been running as fast as I can
And you'll never get over what you can't understand
Pissed off, hanging up the telephone
Forever ain't far, I'm heading home
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Last time you ever gonna find me gone
And I, I'll never let you go again
So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?
What in the hell does a man
Have to do, to be loved by you?
So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?
What in the hell does a man
Have to do, to be loved by you?
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
