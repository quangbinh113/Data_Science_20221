Song Name: Where Are You Christmas - From "Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas" Soundtrack
Han
Han, han-han
Mh-mh-mh-mmh

Where are you Christmas? Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter you used to bring me?
Why can't I hear music play?
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too?
Where are you Christmas? Do you remember
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one, see what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go?
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time, oh
I feel you, Christmas, I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love
Where are you Christmas?
Fills your heart with love
Mh-mhmm
