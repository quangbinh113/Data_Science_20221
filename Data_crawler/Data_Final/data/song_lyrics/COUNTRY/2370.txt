Song Name: It Hurts To Want It So Bad
It's a lot like bein' little
And wantin' a brand new toy
It's a lot like bein' little
And wantin' a baby boy
To call brother
And it hurts when you want it so bad
It's a lot like bein' a young boy
Who cannot make the team
It's a lot like bein' a young girl
Who cannot help but dream
Of her best friend's brother
And it hurts when you want it so bad
When it's love
That you've had and lost
Baby, if that's the worst hurt
That you've ever had
Waitin' for a new love to come along
And maybe, baby, it's just as bad
It's a lot like bein' a man
When no one to call your own
It's a lot like bein' a woman
You wanting a house and a home
To be a mother
And it hurts when you want it so bad
When it's love
That you've had and lost
Baby that's the worst hurt
That you've ever had
Waitin' for a new love to come along
May be, it's just as bad
It's a lot like bein' a young boy
Who cannot make the team
It's a lot like bein' a young girl
Who cannot help but dream
Of her best friend's brother
And it hurts when you want it so bad
Tell you it's gonna hurt so bad
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
When you want it
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
Baby hurts so bad
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
When you want it, when you want it
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
Just can't stand it
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
You want it so bad
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
Hurts when you want it
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
You want it so bad
(Hurt, hurt, hurt - hurt so bad)
