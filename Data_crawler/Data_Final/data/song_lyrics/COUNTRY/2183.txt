Song Name: Anymore
You give it your best
Try not to regret the past
It's give and take
Some things you just can't take back
I pulled you in, just to push you away
Searching for words that I know, I should say
But I wasn't expecting, the thought of you leaving today
I don't want you to go
But God knows you need to
And just so you know
But damn it, I love you
And I don't know why
It all seem to die in my arms
Well, you don't have to try to be
Every little thing I need anymore
This house that I bought for you
Feels like a big waste of space
I took a night off from drinking
And finally cleaned up the place
I've tried to be, who you want me to be
You try to fit in this life that I live
So let's take a step back and focus
And try to breathe
I don't want you to go
But God knows you need to
And just so you know
Well, damn it, I love you
And I don't know why
It all seem to die in my arms
Well, you don't have to try to be
Every little thing I need anymore
Well, I'm so sick of fighting
Hustle each time, just to let each other down
I don't want you to go
God knows you need to
And just so you know
Damn it, I love you
And I don't know why
It all seem to die in my arms
I don't want you to go
But God knows you need to
And just so you know
Well, damn it, I love you
And I don't know why
It all seem to die in my arms
Well, you don't have to try to be
Every little thing I need anymore
