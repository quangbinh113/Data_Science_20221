Song Name: Woman You Got
Baby, you put a ring on a wild thing
A whole lotta people watched it all go down
There's some things I gotta put out on the table
'Cause time won't it's time to rat me out
I talk smack, I make messes
I win bread, I'm kinda selfish
Don't trust me in the kitchen
Don't dare me, I ain't chicken
You say you love me, I know you love me
Love that you love me, baby
I know you know me, but if I know me
I'm gonna drive you crazy
The thing about me is I'm always getting better
The truth is, boy, it might take forever but
When it comes to loving you, I'm never gonna stop
And that's the kind of woman you got
Mm, yeah
I'm a constant roller coaster of emotions
And by the time you think you got 'em figured out, mm
There's a layer underneath another layer
Will they ever end? I even have my doubts
I lose my phone, can't hold my liquor
To a fault, I ain't a quitter
I like dogs, I'm a collector
I ain't perfect, I'm a perfector
You say you love me, I know you love me
Love that you love me, baby
I know you know me, but if I know me
I'm gonna drive you crazy
The thing about me is I'm always getting better
The truth is, boy, it might take forever but
When it comes to loving you, I'm never gonna stop
And that's the kind of woman you got

That's the kind of woman you got, baby

Baby, you put a ring on a wild thing
You say you love me, I know you love me
Love that you love me, baby
I know you know me, but if I know me
I'm gonna drive you crazy
The thing about me is I'm always getting better
The truth is, boy, it might take forever but
When it comes to loving you, I'm never gonna stop
And that's the kind of woman you got
That's the kind of woman you got, baby
