Song Name: I Can't Love You Anymore
Shoulda known what I was getting in
Fallin' for a boy from Michigan
You love your mom like every Midwest kid
You like driving to Texas
You put up with all my exes
To deserve you, don't know what the hell I did
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
You bring me coffee every morning
You're fun even when you're boring
And then you like me even when I've been a bitch
You watch me while I'm gettin' ready
You lighten up my heavy
You're so good lookin' it kinda makes me sick
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
I can try to talk you down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now, aye-aye
You're the angel to my devil
The pot to my kettle
To some, I might be an acquired taste
You tell me I'm your favorite person
Hey, what we've got is working
And the years have only made it more that way
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Heaven knows that I've attempted
Couldn't even put a dent in
I can't love you any more than I do now
