Song Name: Guys Like Me
I'm a Friday night fast car flying
Down the interstate
Sometimes I tend to talk too much
And stay out way too late
You're a stay-in on the weekend
Wrapped up in a book you're reading
If oil and water mixed it'd be something like this
Guys like me and girls like you
You're chardonnay, I'm 90 proof
You're a sweet home Alabama
I'm a skyline city view
They say opposites attract
Through history it's been a fact
Some things shouldn't make sense but they do
Like guys like me and girls like you
You're easy going love smooths out
My rough around the edges
My wild and restless side
Can't take you places you've never been
We don't add up on paper
But here we are together
Cause we just go together
Guys like me and girls like you
You're chardonnay, I'm 90 proof
You're a sweet home Alabama
I'm a skyline city view
They say opposites attract
Through history it's been a fact
Some things shouldn't make sense but they do
Like guys like me and girls like you
Guys like me and girls like you
It ain't that out of the blue
Yeah we're living proof
That opposites attract
Through history it's been a fact
Some things shouldn't make sense but they do
Like guys like me and girls like you
Guys like me and girls like you
Guys like me and girls like you
