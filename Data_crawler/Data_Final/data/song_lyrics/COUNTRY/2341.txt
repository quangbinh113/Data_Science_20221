Song Name: Rockin' Into The Night
Ooh rockin'
Rock Texas, you ready to do this?
Oh yeah
C'mon
Here we go!
Cruisin' down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo we got love on our mind
Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the Night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
And we were rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oo-hoo rockin'
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
You got it
Out on the back street
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet Madonna
Ooo, with a bible in her hand
She's waitin', anticipatin'
Well, for someone to save her soul
Well I ain't no new Messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll
And we were rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oh, Texas just say it again, alright
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
And It's slowin' now
C'mon people, I wanna hear you now, woah
Ooh, waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the Night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
We were rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oh, it's Saturday night, you think you can sing it with us?
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
It's your turn now there, you sing it, everybody c'mon
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oh, I know you got more than that, let me hear you
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
One more time, real loud
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
C'mon
Oh, c'mon
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oo-hoo rockin', yeah
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Oo-hoo rockin' tonight
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Yeah-yea, rockin' away tonight
Rockin' into the Night
Rockin' into the Night
Hey, look out
Rockin' into the Night
