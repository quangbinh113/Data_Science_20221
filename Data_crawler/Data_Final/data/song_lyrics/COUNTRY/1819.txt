Song Name: I Was On a Boat That Day
I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
And I was letting the sun and the rum
Just do what it does
I threw my phone in the water
Little push off the dock
She was packing her bags
I was popping a top
Is she gone for the summer, gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing, was she crying
As she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
She could've been halfway
To Houston, but I didn't care
I was drunk as a skunk eating lunch
With a cross-eyed bear
(You been there)
She was looking for something
Better than me
I was looking for nothing
Just riding the breeze
Is she gone for the summer, gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing, was she crying
As she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
And I still got a buzz
Is she gone for the summer, gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing, was she crying
As she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
Hey-hey-hey (hey-hey-hey)
I was on a boat that day
Hey-hey-hey
