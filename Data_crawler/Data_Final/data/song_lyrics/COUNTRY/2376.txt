Song Name: Forever After All
A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe 300,000
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say, "Nothing lasts forever"
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million other things
That I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say, "Nothing lasts forever"
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million other things
That I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
Well, they say, "Nothing lasts forever"
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But heaven knows that, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all
