Song Name: Before the Bullets Fly
I hate to leave you babe
But I just can't waste my time
Well you've got this jealous husband
And I'm too too young to die
I gotta move on away from around here
Just before the bullets fly
I've always been a gabler
Takin' chances all of my life
Bustin' all those love affairs
Just like shootin' dice
I staged the game girl
That's what keeps me satisfied
And I can leave it in the nick of time
Just before the bullets fly
I lost my first bet
When I was twenty-one
Found myself in New Orleans
On the wrong end of a gun
The stakes keep gettin' higher
But somehow I Survive
By knowin' when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly
I'm knowing when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly
I'm knowing when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly
