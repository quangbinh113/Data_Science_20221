Song Name: Searchin' for a Rainbow
I rode into town today... in my mind, I said 'Lord I'd like to stay'.
Something in me said boy, move on...
Don't know what it is the good lord bred it in my bones.
And I'm searchin for a rainbow, and if the wind ever shows me where to go, you'd be waiting at the end and I know, I'd see the hill with that pot of gold.
I'd see the hill with that pot of gold
This old mount I'm ridin', she's gettin' kinda' tired,
But in my heart she knows there's this one desire...
She's gonna' take me to the end of our road...
Then she'll lay down and die and I'll say 'God reat her soul'...
And I'm searchin for a rainbow, and if the wind ever shows me where to go, you'd be waiting at the end and I know, I'd see the hill with that pot of gold.
I'd see the hill with that pot of gold
And I'm searchin for a rainbow, and if the wind ever shows me where to go, you'd be waiting at the end and I know, I'd see the hill with that pot of gold.
I'd see the hill with that pot of gold
And I'm searchin' for a rainbow. and if the wind ever shows me where to go, I'll see the hill with that pot of gold...
I'll see the hill with that pot of gold...
