Song Name: Famous Friends
My buddy Brandon holds the record
For single-season touchdown throws
And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like cheers, they know him everywhere he goes
I've got some famous friends
You probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County
Our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here
In this big city we're in
But when I go back home
I got some famous friends
Yeah, I do
(Oh-oh)
My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights but lеt me go
My boy Randy, he's a preachеr
My girl Megan, she's been teacher of the year
I swear for five years in a row
I've got some famous friends
You probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County
Our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here
In this big city we're in
But when I go back home
I got some famous friends
Yeah, I do
I got friends in high places
On these small town roads
'Cause 'round here it's all about the people that you know
I've got some famous friends
You probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County
Our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here
In this big city we're in
But when I go back home
I got some famous friends
Yeah, I do
Yeah, I do
You might not know 'em here
In this big city we're in
But when I go back home
I got some famous friends, yeah
I've got some famous friends
(I got some famous friends)
Yeah
