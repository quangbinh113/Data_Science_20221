Song Name: Where the Heart Is
What in the world, what in the world
Are we all doin' here?
What do we see, what do we see
When we look in the mirror?
'Cause I'm just lookin'
Lookin' for somethin' true
I believe that I might find it
Maybe I'll find it in you
Just show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Would you show me where the heart is?
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
I need to feel right where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Remember when you felt the sun?
Remember how the rain felt down on your skin?
Where'd you lose your sense of wonder?
The firework goin' off in your head
'Cause there was a time
We weren't thinkin', we were flyin'
We were alive
I wanna feel alive
'Cause I'm just lookin'
Lookin' for somethin' true
And I believe that I might find it
Maybe I'll find it in you
Just show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Would you show me where the heart is?
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
I need to feel right where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Show me how to never grow old
Show me now 'fore I lose my soul
In a world that's gone cold
In a world that's gone cold
Show me where the heart is
Would you show me where the heart is?
I need to feel right where the heart is
Show me where the heart is
The heart is
Show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Would you show me where the heart is?
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
I need to feel right where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
Show me where the heart is
(Where the heart is, where the heart is)
The heart is, yeah
(Show me where the heart is)
Show me where the heart is
(Show me where the heart is)
I need to feel right where the heart is
(Show me where the heart is)
Show me where the heart is
(Show me where the heart is)
The heart is
