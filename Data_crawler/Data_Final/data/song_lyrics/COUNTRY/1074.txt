Song Name: Two Dollars in the Jukebox - 2008 Remaster
I've Got'Two dollars in the jukebox,
And five dollars in a bottle,
And ten more just in case that don't do the trick!
And I'll be'dead broke tomorrow morning,
With heart-aches by the dozen,
And a lady on my mind that's driving me crazy.
Why do I?
Why DO I?
Need to see those blue eyes
Lookin' at me that way again?
After the way she did me,
It's a sin!
How could she?
How could she?
Just walk out and leave me?
After all these nights in her arms,
Look where I am!
And I've Got'Two dollars in the jukebox,
And five dollars in a bottle,
And ten more just in case that don't do the trick!
And I'll be'dead broke tomorrow morning,
With heart-aches by the dozen,
And a lady on my mind that's driving me crazy.
I've Got'Two dollars in the jukebox,
And five dollars in a bottle,
And ten more just in case that don't do the trick!
And I'll be'dead broke tomorrow morning,
With heart-aches by the dozen,
And a lady on my mind that's driving me crazy.
I've got a lady on my mind that's driving me crazy!
