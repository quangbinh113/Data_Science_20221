Song Name: Burn 'Em All
There's a pack of Marlboro reds in my jacket pocket
Slung over the shotgun seat in my truck
Just waiting on the right time and state of mind
Hell, I found, tonight we're gonna burn 'em all
Got a time card sayin' 50 hours runnin'
All my buddies at the bar so come on down
There's a couple brand new 20s in my wallet
Boys I got, tonight we're gonna burn them all
Pour the gas, light the match, set the night on fire
Set the blaze, let the flames get higher
Every cigarette, every dollar, every problem
You got on you from a town this small
Tonight we're gonna burn 'em all
Got a worn out set of Goodyear's on the Chevy
And I know a two lane that was paved for me and you
Girl every midnight, shooting star kiss, waiting on our lips
Tonight we're going to burn 'em all
Pour the gas, light the match, set the night on fire
Set the blaze, let the flames get higher
Every cigarette, every dollar, every problem
You got on you from a town this small
Tonight we're gonna burn 'em all
Every chance, every moment, catch a spark, keep it going, keep it going, yeah
Pour the gas, light the match, set the night on fire
Set the blaze, let the flames get higher
Every cigarette, every dollar, every problem
You got on you from a town this small
Tonight we're gonna burn 'em all
Well we're gonna burn 'em all
We're gonna burn 'em all
