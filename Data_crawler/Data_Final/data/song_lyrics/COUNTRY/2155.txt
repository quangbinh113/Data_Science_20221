Song Name: Neon You
Girl, you sure looked good about 7 a.m.
When you opened up those blue eyes
And rolled out of bed
In that quitting time when I get back home
Then I miss your kiss, it sure turns me on
But I've been waiting all week to show you how
Now we're three beers deep in a two-step tune
Stepping out and your reign loves them both
Out there tomorrow well
Girl, that's the truth
You're a diamond in a rhinestone room
Nothing shines, nothing shines like me on you
Now the spotlights on the band
Don't they know it been a nеw round
Baby, that's the real show
Yeah, I'm holding you closе
That's more than enough
To get me a Friday night buzz
Now we're three beers deep in a two-step tune
Stepping out and your reign loves them both
Out there tomorrow well
Girl, that's the truth
You're a diamond in a rhinestone room
Nothing shines, nothing shines like me on you
Now we're three beers deep in a two-step tune
Stepping out and your reign loves them both
Out there tomorrow well
Girl, that's the truth
You're a diamond in a rhinestone room
Nothing shines, nothing shines like me on you
Oh no, nothing shines, nothing shines like Neon you
