Song Name: Thinkin' About You
I'm not quite sure what's goin' on, but all day through and all night long
I've been thinkin' about you
I've been thinkin' about you.
The look in your eyes when you smile that way
The sound of your voice sayin' my name.
I've been thinkin' about you
Just keep thinkin' about you.
This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love? If you don't then what?
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump the track that it's on.
In the back of my mind, there's a secret place.
But the whole world knows by the smile on my face
That I've been thinkin' about you.
Can't stop thinkin' about you.
This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love? Well if you don't then what?
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump the track that it's on.
I know it's crazy, callin' you this late
When the only thing I wanted to say is
I've been thinkin' about you
Oh, just keep thinkin' about you.
Oh, can't stop thinkin about you.
I'm always thinkin' about you...
And I do love thinking about you...
