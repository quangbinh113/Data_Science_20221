Song Name: Waxahachie
Nobody ever left New Orleans as mad as I was
I wrote a lipstick letter on the mirror with a bourbon buzz
You were right, it got about as bad as it gets
I'm not lookin' for a turn around temple on the rumble strip
Waxahachie, are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive from Louisiana?
Waxahachie, I can be there by 4 a.m.
Looking for my long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh, Waxahachie
If I could just get down the road a beat
It won't be that hard
I can run from the demons like the devil in a speedin' car
I got enough gasoline, memories and nicotine
Freedom's overrated, guess I underestimated the truth
And you
Waxahachie are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive from Louisiana?
Waxahachie, I can be there by 4 a.m.
Looking for my long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Waxahachie are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive from Louisiana?
Waxahachie, it's coming on 4 a.m.
I wanna be in your arms again
Just like I've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh, Waxahachie
