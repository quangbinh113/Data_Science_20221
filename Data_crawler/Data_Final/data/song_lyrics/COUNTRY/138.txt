Song Name: Two Dozen Roses
I brought flowers to your door last ni-ight
I done you wrong and I wanna make it ri-ight
You say I'm not welcome here
I know it oughta be perfectly clear
But I can't help but wonder what it might be like
If I had two dozen roses
And an older bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses
Would it change your mind
Oh I musta been a fool back then
To lose somethin' that you can't have again
I've done all that I know to do
And second guess my every move
But I can't help but wonder how it might have been
If I had two dozen roses
And an older bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses
Would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Baby, would you change your mind
(Oh, baby could you change your mind)
