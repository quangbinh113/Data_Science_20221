Song Name: RSVP
There's cars in the front yard
Red cups in the pool
Strangers I just met
Passed out on my couch in the living room
The record's still skipping
The sun's almost here
Was one for the ages
Yeah I'd still be sayin' cheers
But the
Champagne's all gone
Carpets full of confetti
The cops came and we rocked on
I was the life of the party
But I don't feel that cool
Everyone showed up but you
I saw the invite but
Was too scared to see
You slow dancing, your hands moving onto somebody
Who's taller and blonder than me
I kinda regret it
Not stopping by
But I didn't know if you'd want me to
Walk in and mess up the time of your life
And now
Champagne's all gone
Carpets full of confetti
The cops came and we rocked on
I was the life of the party
But I don't feel that cool
Everyone showed but you
Yeah everyone showed up but you
Last one out front door
Guess I know what that means
This party is over
And your really over me
Champagne's all gone
Carpets full of confetti
Cops came and we rocked on
I was the life of the party (You was the life of the party)
But I don't feel that cool
I'm just not that cool
Everyone showed up but you
Wish nobody showed up but you
Everyone showed up but you
