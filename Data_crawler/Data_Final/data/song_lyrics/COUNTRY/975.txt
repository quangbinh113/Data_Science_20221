Song Name: Roadtripsong
Wrote a letter to the mountains
They'd never hold me back
I love the sky so fiercely
Still the thunder cracks
Gave flowers to the ocean
Still my heart was blue
Out of all the things I've loved, my darling
The best by far is you
I wished so hard that I could fly
My wings just weighed me down
I dreamed that I could be a boat
But I sailed too far and drowned
And though I wished and longed for
These dreams to all come true
Of all the things I've wanted, lover
What I want most is you, you, you, you
I lost the shoes I wore forever
Though they were black and cracked
Missed trains and planes to get to places
I might never go back
I lost my mind along the way
Sounds wild but it's true
Of all the things I've lost, honey
What I've missed most is you, you
