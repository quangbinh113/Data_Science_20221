Song Name: Black Sheep
My daddy was a brakeman on a highball traveling train
My mama, she raised four little children and the family had a good name
And papa and mama wanted all for us they never had
Big brother, little brother, sister too none of them turned out half bad
'Cept me, I'm the black sheep of the family
Big brother went to college and became a doctor man
I guess he makes about a million dollars a year off the folks own insurance plan
He's got a big long Mercedes Benz and a house overlooking the town
He sits in his Jacuzzi and he watches the sun go down
And he feels real sorry for me, I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah, I drive me a big ol' semi truck, I'm makin' payments on a two room shack
My wife, she waits on tables and at night she rubs my back
And I tell her what my papa said to my mama when he got off a highball train
Wake me up early, be good to my dogs and teach my children to pray
Little sister married a banker, yeah, he owns a country club
He bought her a big ol' racing horse and a funny lookin' little dog
He buys her big rings, and diamonds, and a brand new Japanese yacht
They like to get together and talk about all the things they've got
But they never mention me, I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah, I drive me a big ol' semi truck, I'm makin' payments on a two room shack
My wife, she waits on tables and at night she rubs my back
And I tell her what my papa said to my mama when he got off a highball train
Wake me up early, be good to my dogs and teach my children to pray
I'm sayin', woman, wake me up early, be good to my dogs
And teach my children to pray
