Song Name: Blessed
The lights are down but you're shining
Like you always do
Everyday I'm reminded
Of the miracle of you
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night I get a glimpse
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm
I keep checking you for halos
Swear, you're an angel in disguise
You blow my mind from every angle, and I
Can see Heaven in your eyes
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night I get a glimpse
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm
Baby, you're the kind of girl that I always prayed for
And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful
Oh baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Woah, you make me believe
Baby, I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky
But lucky ain't the word, oh, I'm
Blessed
