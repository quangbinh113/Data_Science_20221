Song Name: Making Memories Of Us
I'm gonna be here for ya baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us
I wanna honor your mother
And I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention
Like a bad outlaw
And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better
Than it's ever been
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us
We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way
I'm gonna be here for ya from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
But it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you this promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you
With a warm, wet kiss
Yes I am
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us oh-oh
I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you baby
And I'll win your trust
Makin' memories of us
Oh baby umm
