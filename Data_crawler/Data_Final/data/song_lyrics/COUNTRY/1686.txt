Song Name: Fire Line
It's a careless wind that carries me
Across the great divide
From the wretched underworld
To the place where fear resides
Behind the line you hold
You can only hold so long
When you see my forked tongue
And hear my twisted song
My sign is the fire line, uncontrolled
My bitter ruthlessness is a beacon to behold
Like cancer growing, someday to die
Where the water's flowing
I'm gonna drain the river dry
'Cause it's a poison dream
Keeps me running through the night
I'll take it all and then some more
By the dawning of the sickly morning light
Burn through the midnight oil
And the bridges I can't cross
Somehow I'll find myself in
Everything you've lost
We've seen it all before but
It comes as no surprise
Just like reflections of the fire in your eyes
It's a poison dream
Keeps me running through the night
I'll take it all and then some more
By the dawning of the sickly morning light
And when the work is done and the devil's called his time
You'll feel a sterile breeze that blows through ashen pine
And you may ask yourself where did the endgame lie
The question I might ask if I could stop to wonder why
It's a poison dream
Keeps me running through the night
I'll take it all and then some more
By the dawning of the sickly morning light
It's a poison dream
Keeps me running through the night
I'll take it all and then some more
By the dawning of the sickly morning light
