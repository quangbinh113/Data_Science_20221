Song Name: Hurts the Healing
Maybe tears
Maybe tears don't fall for nothing
Maybe the river's rushing
To baptize me clean
Maybe fear
Is a friend I should be facing
In that midnight cold sweat, shaking
And this prayer I'm whispering
Whoa, goodbyes
Oh, they cut like knives
This pain ain't nothing like I've ever known
This heartbroke has got a hold and won't let go, no
Even in the worst, I got a feeling
Maybe the hurt's the healing
Maybe the hurt's the healing
Maybe lonely is that road digging deeper
Maybe sorrow is the preacher
That brings me back to faith
Maybe failure (oh, failure)
Put a chip here on my shoulder
And you stand a little bolder
To finish this race, yeah
This pain ain't nothing like I've ever known
This heartbroke has got a hold and won't let go, no
Even in the worst, I got a feeling, yeah
Maybe the hurt's the healing, yeah
(Whoa-oh-oh goodbyes)
(Whoa-oh-oh cut like knives)
Maybe losing
In a home team, outnumbered
But it's fuel for the hungry
For that second win, mm (whoa-oh-oh goodbyes)
Oh, yeah, ah (whoa-oh-oh cut like knives)
This pain ain't nothing like I've ever known
This heartbroke has got a hold and won't let go, no
Even in the worst, I got a feeling, yeah
Maybe the hurt's the healing
Maybe the hurt's the healing, yeah
Maybe the hurt's the healing
Maybe the hurt's the healing
