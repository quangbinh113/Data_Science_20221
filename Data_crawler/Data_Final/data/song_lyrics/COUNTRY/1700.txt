Song Name: Something About What Happens When We Talk
If I had my way, I'd be in your town
I might not have stayed
But at least i would have been around
'Cus there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Does this make sense?
It doesn't matter anyway
Is it coincidence?
Was it meant to be?
'Cus there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Conversation feels like a drug
Wasn't your face, so much as it was your words
'Cus there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Well I can't stay around
'Cus I'm going back south
All I regret now, is that I would have kissed your mouth
'Cus there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Ooooh
Ooooh
Something about what happens when we talk
