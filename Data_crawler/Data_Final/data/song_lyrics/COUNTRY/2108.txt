Song Name: Why Have You Left The One You Left Me For
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Has she heard, like me, that slamming door?
Did you leave for good or just get bored?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Is she what you wanted?
Or has time changed your mind?
Has your dream love gone crazy?
And what brings you here tonight?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Has she heard, like me, that slamming door?
Did you leave for good or just get bored?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
I can see you're hurting
But I'm not sure if it's real!
How can I really hold you?
When I don't, when I don't know how you feel?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Has she heard, like me, that slamming door?
Did you leave for good or just get bored?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Okay, come on in! You be my lover! I'll be your friend!
You don't have to tell me, and I won't ask again!
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Has she heard, like me, that slamming door?
Did you leave for good or just get bored?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Has she heard, like me, that slamming door?
Did you leave for good or just get bored?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
Why have you left the one you left me for?
