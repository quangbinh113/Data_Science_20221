Song Name: Watching Airplanes
Sittin' out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin' my watch doin' the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well, those runway lights are getting brighter
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin' to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sittin' out here watching airplanes
I would've lied, could've cried, should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin' down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high, so am I
So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin' to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're 30,000 feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I oughta act like you don't love me
But I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin' to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Yeah, I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
No, bye, bye, bye
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Baby bye bye, bye, bye, bye
Yeah, I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Bye, bye, bye, bye
