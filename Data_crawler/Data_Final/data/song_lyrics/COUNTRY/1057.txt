Song Name: Man in Black
Well, you wonder why
I always dress in black
Why you never see
Bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance
Seem to have a somber tone?
Well, there's a reason for the things
That I have on
I wear the black
For the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless
Hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner
Who has long paid for his crime
But is there because
He's a victim of the times
I wear the black
For those who've never read
Or listened
To the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness
Through love and charity
Why you'd think He's talking
Straight to you and me
Well, we're doin' mighty fine
I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars
And fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded
Of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be
A man in black
I wear it
For the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones
Whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin'
For the lives that could have been
Each week we lose
A hundred fine young men
And, I wear it
For the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord
Was on their side
I wear it for another
Hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all
Were on their side
Well, there's things
That never will be right, I know
And things need changin'
Everywhere you go
But till we start to make a move
To make a few things right
You'll never see me
Wear a suit of white
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow
Every day
And tell the world
That everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off
A little darkness on my back
Till things are brighter
I'm the man in black
