Song Name: I Hope
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way it made me smile on the other end of a
Phone in the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about
Her then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more
Free, tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest
Dreams, she's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Yeah babe, I hope she shows up in a two AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just hate him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more
Free, tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest
Dreams, she's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
I hope it goes, comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more
Free, tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest
Dreams, she's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Like you did on me
