Song Name: Handle On You
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Dropped a needle on a vinyl and cried to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby, breaking the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got, 'cause you're gone
Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day, black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til, "I miss you," don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks
Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day, black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Well, I finally got a handle on you
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
Handle on you
Yeah, I finally got a handle on you
