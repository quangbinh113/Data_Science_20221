Song Name: See You One More Time
Lord I've always been a drifter
Seems like I was always passing through
I never met anybody or anything
I just had to come back to you
But the minute I saw you
All my dreams were standing in line
And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows, if I could see you
Just one more time
If I could see you one more time
There's just a few things on my mind
Just a few more things that I'd like to tell ya
If I could see you just one more time
As I travel down the highway
Got to be the gypsy in my bones
But all I do is see your smiling face
Makes a man feel so alone
But you've already captured my soul
And slowly you're invading my mind
And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows if I could see you
Just one more time
If I could see you one more time
There's just a few things on my mind
Just a few more things that I'd like to tell ya
If I could see you
Just one more time
If I could see you one more time
If I could see you one more time
If I could see you one mroe time
If I could see you one more time
