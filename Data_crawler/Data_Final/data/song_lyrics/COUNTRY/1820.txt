Song Name: Rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a 20 every time that I picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you hit that gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gamblin'
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drownin' in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rollin' off your lips
Is money fallin' from the sky
Shit, I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sittin' on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you made my heart feel cheap
I might as well won the lottery
All of this pain in me cursin' your name
Would just turn into dollar signs
'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gamblin'
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drownin' in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rollin' off your lips
Is money fallin' from the sky
Shit, I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet, I'ma do this again
Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gamblin'
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drownin' in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rollin' off your lips
Is money fallin' from the sky
Shit, I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
I'd be rich
La, ah, ah, ah, ah, de, da
