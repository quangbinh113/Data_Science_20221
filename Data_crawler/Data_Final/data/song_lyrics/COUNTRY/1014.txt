Song Name: Miles Away
It started out heading south on the PCH
Winding through the hills and the heartache.
It was quite a view in Santa Cruz
Where the cliffs meet the sea,
'Til waves of you crashed over me.
I came undone on the 101 when the night got cold.
You know, I'd never make this trip alone.
Your bright eyes came to mind
With every star on 66.
Well maybe there's no outrunning this.
There's a highway that I ain't found,
Where your memory won't break me down.
Somewhere east of the Mississippi,
South of the Mason Dixon,
And just outside of nothing left to lose.
And miles away from missing you.
Brought a gold cross at a truck stop in New Mexico.
Was prayin' for the strength to let you go.
With every county line I'm trying to find
A road to take me there,
But I'm not getting anywhere.
'Cause, there's a highway that I ain't found,
Where your memory won't break me down.
Somewhere east of the Mississippi,
South of the Mason Dixon,
And just outside of nothing left to lose.
And miles away from missing you.
Maybe one more tank of gas and I might find it
If I can't leave you in the past then I'll keep drivin'.
There's a highway that I ain't found,
Where your memory won't break me down.
Somewhere east of the Mississippi,
South of the Mason Dixon,
And just outside of nothing left to lose.
And miles away from missing you.
Mmm, miles away.
