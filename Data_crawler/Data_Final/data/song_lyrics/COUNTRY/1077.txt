Song Name: Country Sunshine
You say you love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Running through the fields of daisies, wading through the creek
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show and the joy that a bluebird brings
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the morning that make each day a joy to see
The nighttime brings a peaceful feeling that rests inside of me
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Yes,you love me and it's inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh, I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
