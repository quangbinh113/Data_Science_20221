Song Name: San Antonio Rose
Ah-ha
That San Antonio Rose, ah
Ah-ha
Deep within my heart lies a melody (aw, tell 'em, Tommy)
A song of old San Antone (San Antone)
Where in dreams I live with a memory (yes, yes, go on)
Beneath the stars all alone (all alone)
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know (imagine)
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit path by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Ah, Junior, yeah
Ah-ha
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Oh, broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit path by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
