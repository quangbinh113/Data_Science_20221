Song Name: Friend
Went from strangers to hello
From going out to going home
To ending up in what we didn't know we started
Went from saying this won't work
To you wrapped up in my shirt
And somehow now I have the keys to your apartment
I guess the best mistakes
Still can't be undone
I just hope that when you think of me
You don't think of me as one
I'm not asking for a lover
I just want us not to end, yeah
If I can't have you, then I want the closest thing
No, I'm not asking to get back again
No, tonight, I'm just asking for a friend
I went from waking up with you
To lonely filling up the room
To knowing you could never love me at my darkest
I can get over your kiss
And the late night talks I miss
It's the distance that you made that hits the hardest
Oh, I guess the best mistakes
Still can't be undone
I just hope that when you think of me
You don't think of me as one
I'm not asking for a lover
I just want us not to end, yeah
If I can't have you
Then I want the closest thing
No, I'm not asking to get back again
No, tonight, I'm just asking for a friend
Oh, I'm just for
A friend, a friend, a friend
Oh, I'm just asking for
A friend, a friend
I'm not asking for a lover
I just want us not to end
If I can't have you
Then I want the closest thing
No, I'm not asking to get back again
No, tonight, I'm just asking for a friend
No, tonight, I'm just asking for a friend
