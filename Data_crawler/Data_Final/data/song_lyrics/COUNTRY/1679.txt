Song Name: The Highway Song
It all started I was seventeen
Fell in love with a man who didn't love me
So I've been breaking hearts
Trying to fill a spot that he left empty
It all started back when I was naive
Loved him with every part of me
Can't be the woman that I should be
Cheap thrills and cheaper Dreams
On a highway with no name
We're all high on Mary Jane
And I bummed one cigarette
But now I'm smoking like a train
I got a man from Oklahoma
And I told him that I loved him
But I was born for leaving
I'll be gone in the morning
Now I'm tired and I'm alone
But it's been so long this is all I know
And it kills me what his pictures show
He's better off on his own
I'm just a memory from his beaten path
A memory that'll never last
But he is everything that I have ever known
On a highway with no name
We're all high on Mary Jane
And I bummed one cigarette
But now I'm smoking like a train
I got a man from Oklahoma
And I told him that I loved him
But I was born for leaving
I'll be gone in the morning
Just when I think that I'm over it
It comes in the form of a sleepless night
Just when I think that I'm movin' on
It comes in the form of a heartache song
Just when I think that I'm over it
It comes in the form of a cocaine habit
Just when I think that I'm movin' on
It comes in the form of a heartache song
On a highway with no name
We're all high on Mary Jane
And I bummed one cigarette
But now I'm smoking like a train
I got a man from Oklahoma
And I told him that I loved him
But I was born for leaving
I'll be gone in the morning
