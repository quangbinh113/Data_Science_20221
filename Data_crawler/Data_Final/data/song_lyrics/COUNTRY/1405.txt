Song Name: Blame 'Em Both
My sin is kin to yours and his and hers, it's not original
If forgiveness was just a simple word
It'd be a miracle
Time will tell, but right now won't
If we swim or sink like stones
There's a well within my soul
Where all my wishes go
And if you listen close enough
You can hear the sorry echo
Do you blame the coin or the hand
The fool or the gold
Blame your head or your heart, baby, I don't know
So, I blame 'em both
I blame 'em both
Learning how to live in a house of cards, you gotta hold your breath
And ever since the night I broke your heart, I'm in the wilderness
I've been between a rock and a really hard place
Got a new place but it feels awfully lonely
Ship in a bottle and I'm lost at sea
Hoping that the stars bring you back to me
There's a well within my soul
Where all my wishes go
And if you listen close enough
You can hear the sorry echo
Do you blame the coin or the hand
The fool or the gold
Blame your head or your heart, baby, I don't know
So, I blame 'em both
I blame 'em both
I know the lost might get found somehow
I know the lost might get found but right now
There's a well within my soul
Where all my wishes go
And if you listen close enough
You can hear the sorry echo
Do you blame the coin or the hand
The fool or the gold
Blame your head or your heart, baby, I don't know
So, I blame 'em both
I blame 'em both
My sin is kin to yours and his and hers, it's not original
