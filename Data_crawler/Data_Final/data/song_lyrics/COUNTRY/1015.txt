Song Name: Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'
Whenever I've chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face
Any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why, I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Well, people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing

The secret I'm speakin' of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home
