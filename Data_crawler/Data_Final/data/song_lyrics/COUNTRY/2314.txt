Song Name: Keep Your Hands to Yourself
I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-tingles
Call you on the telephone, baby, I give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggn, no kissin, til I get a wedding ring"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, why you want treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy, I still feel the same way
That's since she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said, "No huggn, no kissin, til I get a wedding vow"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
...
You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin
And I said, "Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said, "No huggn, no kissin, til you make me your wife"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
