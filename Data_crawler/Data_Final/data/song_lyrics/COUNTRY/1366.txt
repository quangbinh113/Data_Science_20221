Song Name: Beer Ain't Gonna Drink Itself
I've been working like a dog
And my collar is blue
Got everybody tellin' me what I need to do
But I got a boat I need to float
And some catfish to catch
And some smokey ol' jukebox buttons to press
But I'm sitting here sober
It's a quarter past two
And I got some catch a buzz catchin up to do
Them ice cubes in the cooler
Ain't gon' last all day
Neither is the sun in the sky
I got some Waylon, Hank, Haggard
And some Skynyrd to play
And it's time to let that Freebird fly
If a good time's what I'm after
Y'all it starts right here
On longneck number 1 of 12
And I reckon that I better get my ass in gear
That beer ain't gonna drink itself
Later on I'll do a shot or two with some sweet honey
Tip that country band a little too much money
Burn that mother up until they shut it down
But that ain't gonna happen 'less I crack one now
Them ice cubes in the cooler
Ain't gon' last all day
Neither is the sun in the sky
I got some Waylon, Hank, Haggard
And some Skynyrd to play
And it's time to let that Freebird fly
If a good time's what I'm after
Y'all it starts right here
On longneck number 1 of 12
And I reckon that I better get my ass in gear
That beer ain't gonna drink itself
Yeah I better get to work
Get right down to business
What good is a koozie with a hot beer in it
Them ice cubes in the cooler
Ain't gon' last all day
Neither is the sun in the sky
I got some Waylon, Hank and Haggard
And some Skynyrd to play
And it's time to let that Freebird fly
If a good time's what I'm after
Y'all it starts right here
On longneck number 1 of 12
And I reckon that I better get my ass in gear
That beer ain't gonna drink itself
