Song Name: Islands To Nashville
If you turn on the radio
You hear the same ole kinda songs
Beauty everywhere you go
It's like nothing could go wrong
We both love to sing and dance
Laugh all through the night
Baby if you take my hand
I promise to love you right
She asked me where I'm from
I said the islands made me
Can you take me there?
I said we're going believe me
You got the banjo, I got my uke
I'm wearing sandals, you're wearing boots
Still gon' jam out by the bonfire
And we both love BBQ
When it comes to fun, we don't really differ
I ride the waves you raft the river
Same ole kinda deal
Put a flower in ya ear
Bring the islands to Nashville
Bring the islands to Nashville
A good vibey sing-a-long
Is all we need to start
Come on baby bring it home
This my favorite part
Love it when you take me round
We go and catch a show
Or baby when you break it down
I can't leave you alone
She asked me where I'm from
I said the islands made me
Can you take me there?
I said we're going believe me
You got the banjo, I got my uke
I'm wearing sandals, you're wearing boots
Still gon' jam out by the bonfire
And we both love BBQ
When it comes to fun, we don't really differ
I ride the waves you raft the river
Same ole kinda deal
Put a flower in ya ear
Bring the islands to Nashville
Bring the islands to Nashville
I like whenever you're with me
I'll come wherever you go
You're my Tennessee whiskey
I'm drunk off all of your love
I like whenever you're with me
I'll come wherever you go
You're my Tennessee whiskey
I'm drunk off all of your love
When it comes to fun, we don't really differ
I ride the waves you raft the river
Same ole kinda deal
Put a flower in ya ear
Bring the islands to Nashville
Bring the islands to Nashville
Bring the islands to Nashville
Bring the islands to Nashville
