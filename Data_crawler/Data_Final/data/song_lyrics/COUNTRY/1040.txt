Song Name: Rose Garden
Let me do this old song and see if you remember this
Let's do this thing, and we'll do a couple of different things
Let me see if you can sing
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
(Oh, God we've a sunshine, oh man) there's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh whoa, whoa, whoa
I beg your pardon (checks in the mail) I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond ring
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So, you better think it over
When sweet-talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melanchoâ€”, sing along
Come along and share the good times while we can
(I beg your pardon) I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime
(You guys are great, oh, well, Wonder, Steve)
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
There won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can (come on)
(I beg your pardon) I never promised you a rose garden (I like that)
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime
