Song Name: Long Journey Home
I lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
Two-dollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
There's black smoke a-rising and it looks like a train
Looks like a train, boys, looks like a train
There's black smoke a-rising and it looks like a train
I'm on my long journey home
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
Two-dollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
Cloudy in the East and it looks like some rain
Looks like some rain, boys, looks like some rain
Cloudy in the East and it looks like some rain
I'm on my long journey home
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
Two-dollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
There's a little girl's a-waiting and she's holdin' down the line
Holdin' down the line boys, holdin' down the line
The little girl's waiting and she's holdin' down the line
I'm on my long journey home
I lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
Two-dollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
Lost all my money but a two-dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
Two-dollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
Lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
Yes, I'm on my long journey home
