Song Name: Year to Be Young 1994
I must admit I felt the flame
Kurt Cobain
A Fender Mustang
MTV brought me up
This is your brain on drugs
I Won't forget that first girlfriend
That got me into Boyz II Men
I grew up a lot that year
My sweatshirt said no fear
My life was a stereo
Man it was everything
First one in line for the last dance with Mary Jane
Hiding in my headphones laying on a bedroom floor
1994
Tell mom see ya later
Don't be blowin' up my pager
When the shows over I'll come home
When that is, I don't know
Teen spirit in the air
Before we owned all cell phones
In study hall passin' notes
Yes, no, or I don't care
When my life was a stereo
Man it was everything
Soundtrack, first kiss
Out at the roller rink
Hands held
Two hearts
Fallin' on a hardwood floor
1994
1994
Think you know it all when you don't know any better
Tell yourself
You're gonna live forever
Fires burnin' and I'm still holdin' the torch
From 1994
My life was a stereo
Man it was everything
Soundtrack track takes me back
Through all those memories
Hiding in my headphones
Laying on the bedroom floor
It takes me back to the days when a song was so much more
1994
1994
1994
