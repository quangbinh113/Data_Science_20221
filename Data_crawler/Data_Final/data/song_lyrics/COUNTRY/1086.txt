Song Name: The Grand Tour
Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone
Over there, sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper 'Oh, I love you'
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew
Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture?
On the table
Don't it look like she'd be able just to touch me
And say good morning dear
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart
Step right up
Come on in
