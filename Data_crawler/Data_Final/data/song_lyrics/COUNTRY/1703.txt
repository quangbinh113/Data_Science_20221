Song Name: Scale These Walls
I don't wanna hide
But I've got my pride
And I don't like to ever need
Someone by my side
I stay locked up all the time
And I tell myself I'm free
But I want you close to me
Come on over here and scale these walls
I built them just for you
Come on over here and scale these walls
I feel your love breaking through
I spent my whole life in fight or flight
But I called it holding ground
So I'll let you in, slowly brick by brick
'Cause I don't want to hold back now
I wanna let it all fall down
Come on over here and scale these walls
I built them just for you
Come on over here and scale these walls
I feel your love breaking through
Come on over here and scale these walls
I built them just for you
Come on over here and scale these walls
I feel your love breaking through
Only your love's breaking through
