Song Name: The Fightin' Side Of Me
I hear people talkin' bad
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harpin' on the wars we fight
An' gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be
An' I don't mind 'em switchin' sides
An' standin' up for things they believe in
When they're runnin' down my country, man
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Yeah walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down a way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims, he just don't believe in fightin'
An' I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on bein' free
They love our milk an' honey
But they preach about some other way of livin'
When they're runnin' down my country, hoss
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Yeah walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down a way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Yeah walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down a way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
