Song Name: Then What?
Well I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said I know what's on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass aint always greener on the other side
Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it aint really love and it aint really lust
You aint anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you cant turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what
Well I aint saying that looking's a crime
Well I've done my share from time to time
It dont mean that you gotta take that leap
When you're standin' on the brink
Before you jump you gotta step back and think
There's price for ever promise you dont keep
Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it aint really love and it aint really lust
You aint anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you cant turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what
Do want you want, do want you wish
It's your life but remember this
There's bound to be some consequences
Sneaking under other fences
Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it aint really love and it aint really lust
You aint anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you cant turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what
