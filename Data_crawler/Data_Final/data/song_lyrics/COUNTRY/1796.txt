Song Name: Aw Naw
Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut'er down
Just take it to the house
'Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay, hey
Aw naw, look at the time y'all
What happend to coats on
Long gone
I should be halfway home but, aw naw
Yeah
Girl, I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah
I got my boys with me
We're just blowin' off steam
Not looking to pick up anybody
I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes
Aw naw, do you hear that song
The one that just came on
C'mon DJ what you tryin' to do?
Aw naw, it'll be so wrong
If we didn't dance one
Show off those jeans you painted on
Aw naw, aw naw, aw naw
No, I didn't mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave, so it ain't my fault
No, I didn't mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I supposed to do?
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that patron
Hang on, we've been here all night long
Aw naw
It'll be so wrong
If we didn't dance one more song
Show off those jeans you painted on
Aw naw, yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on
Aw naw
