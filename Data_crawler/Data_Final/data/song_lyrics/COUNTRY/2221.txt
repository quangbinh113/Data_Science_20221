Song Name: Five Minutes
You look so disbelieving
At my suitcase by the door
My taxi's on it's way
I can't take it anymore
Lately you've forgotten
What loving me is about
Well, now you've got five minutes
To figure it out
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time
To change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out
Now I've got your attention
Here's what I've got to say
You'd better do some talking
'Cause my taxi's on it's way
We used to set the nights on fire
Now everyday is the same
But now you've got five minutes
To kindle the flame
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time
To change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out
You can start with "Please don't leave me"
And end with "I love you"
And if you'd only kiss me
The way you used to do
You could see a miracle come true
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time
To change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out
You've still got five minutes
To figure it out
