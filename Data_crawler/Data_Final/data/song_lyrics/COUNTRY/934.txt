Song Name: I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus
You're not gonna believe what I saw, ha
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't hear me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
I saw it with my own two eyes
Not only were they kissing, they were drinking and eating cookies together
Now, I know how to keep a secret 'cause I wanna stay on Santa's good side
You just don't tell everything you know, nuh-uh
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't hear me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
But I wasn't...
I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Don't you go tellin' either, it's our secret!
