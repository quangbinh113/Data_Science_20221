Song Name: Black Powder Soul
Oh I'm a warless soldier
I'm a lawless man
No I don't play poker since that stint in Spokane
Over some bootleg moonshine
Over my bathtub gin
That's why my over under is my only friend
Black powder
Oh black powder soul
I've got dark clouds above me
And the fire is below
My heart is burning
My blood runs cold
I've got a black powder lord
Black powder soul
Oh you can run them tables
You can't out run them
Cowboys and hustlers holding a steel wheel hand
Best blood money is what keeps you fed
When there ain't no running east or west
Black powder
Oh black powder soul
I've got dark clouds above me
And the fire is below
My heart is burning
My blood runs cold
I've got a black powder lord
Black powder soul
