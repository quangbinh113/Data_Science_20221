Song Name: Gold
It ain't easy
Nobody said it would be
You finally find that greener grass
But you're still in the weeds
Ain't it crazy
All the time that you spend
Drivin' through the rainbow for the pot at the end
I got some rust on my Chevy but it's ready to roll
I got a rhinestone sky and a song in my soul
It ain't a smooth ride, life, it's a winding road
Yeah, it might be gravel, but it feels like gold
I've been climbin'
Tryin' to get to the view
I'm at the bottom but the sky's still pretty damn blue
They say Heaven
Is somewhere on the other side
But I ain't waitin'
Hell, I'm thinkin', it's a state of mind
I got somе rust on my Chevy but it's ready to roll
I got a rhinestonе sky and a song in my soul
It ain't a smooth ride, life, it's a winding road
Yeah, it might be gravel, but it feels like gold
Yeah, it feels like gold
Yeah, it feels like gold
Got my baby sittin' by me
Shinin' like a diamond
Only silver linings in the clouds
And if it starts to rain
I don't worry 'bout a thing
I pull my rose-colored Ray-Ban's out
I got some rust on my Chevy but it's ready to roll
I got a rhinestone sky and a song in my soul
It ain't a smooth ride, life, it's a winding road
Yeah, it might be gravel, but it feels like gold
Yeah, it feels like gold (yeah, it does)
Yeah, it feels like gold
It ain't a smooth ride, life, it's a winding road
Yeah, it might be gravel, but it feels like gold
One, two, three
