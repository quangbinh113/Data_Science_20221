Song Name: COUNTRY TO THE CITY
Aj on the!!
Forgies on a big truck lift kit jacked up
Purple in my sprite round here we call it act up
Put a couple 1's on her booty made her back up
Country to the city man I had to get my racks up
J's on the pedal heading 19 south bound
Headed to Atlanta gotsome broades waiting downtown
Kick'em out the penthouse if they ain't going down town
Country ass thug in the city going wild child
Sitting on forgies they ain't fuel
In myseat keep a tool
Sitting high check the view
Bad bitches got a few, and my chains on with the jewels
Custom made designer boots
Popping 762's I don't fuck with 22's
This a dead end dirt road
You better throw it in reverse
In the back we got them poles
Don't make me throw you in a Hirse
Yea I'm the first Country Boy to make'em throw it back and twerk
Ain't on whiskey I'm on actavis a xanny and a perk (uhhhhhh, ya right)
When that country boy in the city
I'll smack her on the tittie ya heard me (uhhuhhhh)
Ain't nobody fucking with me (yeeee)
Forgies on a big truck lift kit jacked up
Purple in my sprite round here we call it act up
Put a couple 1's on her booty made her back up
Country to the city man I had to get my racks up
J's on the pedal heading 19 south bound
Headed to Atlanta gotsome broades waiting downtown
Kick'em out the penthouse if they ain't going down town
Country ass thug in the city going wild child
Forgies on a big truck lift kit jacked up
Purple in my sprite round here we call it act up
Put a couple 1's on her booty made her back up
Country to the city man I had to get my racks up
J's on the pedal heading 19 south bound
Headed to Atlanta gotsome broades waiting downtown
Kick'em out the penthouse if they ain't going down town
Country ass thug in the city going wild child
