Song Name: Hey Moon
Hey moon, it's me again
That guy that's always checkin' back in
How's she doin', I'm hopin' better
Better than I've been
Hey moon, there's someone, you see
That stands between her love and me
And I miss her, damn, I miss her
Hey moon, I'm giving it all that I got
Hey moon, I'm down to my last shot
And I know that it's crazy talkin' to a rock in the sky
Oh, but I gotta try
Hey moon, is she lookin' up
From her room and thinkin' of us
Has she been tucked in
Wonderin' where I've been
Dreamin' about seein' me again
Hey moon, I'm giving it all that I got
Hey moon, I'm down to my last shot
And I know that it's crazy talkin' to a rock in the sky
But I gotta try
Hey moon
Hey moon, if you see my little girl
Would you shine your light on her world?
Trust m–µ, I know it's crazy talkin' to a rock in the sky
Oh, but I gotta try
Hey, hey moon
