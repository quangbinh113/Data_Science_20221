Song Name: If I Were a Carpenter
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby?
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you?
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
If I were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colored blouse
And your soft shoes shining?
If you were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
I'd not miss my colored blouse
And my soft shoes shining
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
If I worked my hands on wood
Would you still love me?
I'd answer you, yes I would
And would you not be above me?
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
