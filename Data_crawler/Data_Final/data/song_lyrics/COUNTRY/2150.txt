Song Name: Highways
Another song, another town
Leavin' hurts, but you can't slow down
Yeah, another night, another show, neon rodeo
Miss you, baby, gotta go
It's goodbyes and wrong turns
Long nights and lessons learned
Baby, I know it's hard
Love you, but I can't stay
My life is always
Highways and broken hearts
Highways and broken hearts
The lights go out, the lonely's strong
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is comin' home
Ah, but baby, there's a part of me
That's guitars and gypsy dreams
Guess it's always gonna be
Goodbyes and wrong turns
Long nights and lessons learned
Baby, I know it's hard
Love you, but I can't stay
My life is always
Highways and broken hearts
Broken hearts
Yeah, broken hearts
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
One day, I might slow it down
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, but baby, for now
It's goodbyes and wrong turns
Long nights and lessons learned
Baby, I know it's hard
Love you, but I can't stay
My life is always
Highways and broken hearts
It's goodbyes and wrong turns
Long nights and lessons learned
Baby, I know it's hard
Love you, but I can't stay
My life is always
Highways and broken hearts
Yeah, it's highways and broken hearts
Oh, it's highways and broken hearts
Yeah, it's highways and broken hearts
