Song Name: Life is a Highway
Whoo!
Mmm, yeah
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here, and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood, and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road, and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (whoo!)
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)
A-gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long, mmm, yeah
If you're goin' my way (if you're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye, ooh, yeah
Mmm, yeah (whoo!)
There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (all night long, yeah)
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
A-gimme, gimme, gimme
A-gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway (life is a highway)
I wanna ride it all night long, whoo, ooh, yeah
If you're goin' my way (if you're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long, yeah)
C'mon, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
(Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby)
If you're goin' my way (if you're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)
