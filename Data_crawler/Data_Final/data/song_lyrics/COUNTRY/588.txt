Song Name: No News
She said, "It's just a woman thing"
And pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry
I'm an understanding guy
I heard when you love someone
You gotta let them go
She hollered, "When I find myself
You'll be the first to know"
Ooh hoo no news
I've learned to do the laundry
Feed the cat and clean the house
I promised to be patient
While she worked her problems out
When she packed her bags
Her destination was unclear
But I sensed that her intentions
Were honest and sincere
Ooh hoo no news
She could telephone, tell a friend
Tell a lie bout where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax
Write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke
Tap it out in Morse code
I'd prefer a bad excuse
To no news
Her mama's been a little vague
As to her whereabouts
Her sister says, "I'm certain
Your romance is headed south"
I don't have a single doubt
That she's still in love
My level of anxiety
Is just a product of
Ooh hoo no news
She could telephone, tell a friend
Tell a lie bout where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax
Write it on a post-
Send a signal up in smoke
Tap it out in Morse code
I'd prefer a bad excuse
She missed her bus, missed her plane
Surely this can be explained
Lost her car at the mall
Got locked in a bathroom stall
Joined a cult, joined the Klan
On the road with Pearl Jam
Buried with the Grateful Dead
Came back as a parrot head
Got derailed, got de-iced
Offered as a sacrifice
FBI, CIA, if they've seen her
They ain't saying
No news! Still no news! Oh oh oh
