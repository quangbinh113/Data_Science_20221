Song Name: Dreams I'll Never See
Mmmhmm, Mmhm yeah-eah-yeah
Just one more morning
I have to wake up with the blues
Pull myself outta bed, yeah
Put on my walkin' shoes
Climb up on a hilltop, babe-uh
See what I can see, oh yeah
Whole world's fallin' down, oh babe
Right down in front of me
'Cause I'm hung up
Lord on dreams I'm never gonna see, yeah
Lord help me, babe
Dreams get the best of me, yeah
Pull myself together
Gonna put on a new face, yeah
And climb down from the hilltop, baby
Lord get back in the race
'Cause I got dreams
I've got my dreams
To remember the love we had
I got dreams
I've got my dreams
To remember the love we had
An' I'm hung up
Lord on dreams
I'm never gonna see, yeah
Not me
Lord help me, babe
Dream get the best of me, yeah... ooh
Alright... yeah-eah-yeah
Pull myself together
Put on a new face, yeah
Climb down from the hilltop, baby
Lord get back in the race
'Cause I got dreams
I've got my dreams
To remember the love we make
I've got dreams
I've got my dreams
To remember the love we make
An' I'm hung up, Lord hung up on dreams
I'm never gonna see, yeah
Not bad, not bad
Lord help me, girl
Dream get the best of me, yes
Alright
Yeow
