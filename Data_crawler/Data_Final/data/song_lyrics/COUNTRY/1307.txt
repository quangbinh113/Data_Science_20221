Song Name: Jersey Giant
I remember all them summers
Playing 'til my fingers bled
You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with you
We'd get drunk and go to bed
Looking back at all them memories
Lord, I hate to sleep alone
But if you ever get the notion
That you need me, let me know
'Cause it's just two hours to get there babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs that you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord I thought you hung the moon
Lord I thought you hung the moon
I remember all them winters
Drinking Woodford 'til we drowned
We'd get wind about a party
Bundle up and go to town
Never worry 'bout the police
Never worried much at all
I miss those nights of reckless glory
And I'd come back if you'd just call
'Cause it's just two hours to get there babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord I thought you hung the moon
I left town when we were over
'Cause it didn't feel the same
Every backroad had a memory
And every memory held your name
'Cause it's just two hours to get there babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord I thought you hung the moon
Lord I thought you hung the moon
