Song Name: Hold onto Me
When you feel your world shaking
And when you feel your faith fading
When you feel like a love is taking, way too long
Baby, hold on to me
Tighter than your sweetest memory, of you and me
When you're looking for an open door
But it seems so out of reach
Baby, hold on to me, on to me
Life can weigh you down like a stone
It can bend you, break you
Leave you skin and bones
It's a long and winding road
You don't have to walk alone
So baby, hold on to me, onto me
Tighter than your sweetest memory, of you and me
A place to lay your troubles down
That's what I'll be
Baby, hold on to me, on to me, yeah-yeah
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
A place to lay your troubles down
That's what I'll be
So baby, hold on to me, on to me
Tighter than your sweetest memory, of you and me
When you're looking for an open door
But it seems so out of reach
Baby, hold on to me, on to me
Hold on to me, on to me, yeah yeah
Hold on to me
Woah, woah, waah
