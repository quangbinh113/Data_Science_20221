Song Name: Girl On Fire
I wonder if those whisperin' pines ever told our secrets
'Cause if I have one too many, I'll tell you mine
A story of how the first cut is the deepest
And how some old flames just don't fade with time
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shootin' for the stars we were blowin' up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glove box lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doin', I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
I wonder if you ever made it out to Colorado
Or did the Santa Ana's take you to the coast
You might've tried settlin' down
But you can't be what you're not though
You were born to burn just a little out of control
Trust me, I know
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shootin' for the stars we were blowin' up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glove box lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doin', I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
Like the sky turns at night
When the sun dips down just right
That was us, we were young
We were love on fire
On fire
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shootin' for the stars we were blowin' up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glove box lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doin', I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
Tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
