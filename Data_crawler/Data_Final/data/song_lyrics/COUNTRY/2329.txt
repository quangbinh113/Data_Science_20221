Song Name: That Smell
Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree, you're in my way
There's too much Coke and too much smoke
Look what's goin' on inside you
Oo-oo that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell
The smell of death's around you (Yeaah)
Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (Yeah, voodoo)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink, fool, will drown you (Hell, yeah)
Oo-oo that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell
The smell of death's around you
Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of ludes
Say you'll be alright, come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)
Oo-oo that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell
The smell of death's around you
(Oh, you're a fool you, ahh, stickin' needles in your arm)
(I know I've been here before)
Well one little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix, Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell, yeah)
Oo-oo that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell
The smell of death's around you
Oo-oo that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell
The smell of death's around you
(Hey, you're a fool, you, aww stick those needles in your arm)
(Yeah, just a fool, just a fool, just a fool, com' on)
