Song Name: Play Something Country
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time
I like Kenny, Keith, Alan and Patsy Cline
I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said I didn't come here to hear
Somethin' thumpin' from the city
Said I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' countr
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot yelled I'm a George Strait junkie
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country
Yeah, the bartender yelled y'all, it's closin' time
She got this wild look on her face
An' said your truck or mine
I know a place down the road
It's kinda funky
Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country
Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot yelled I'm a George Strait junkie
Ah-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country
Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this ba
Threw back a shot; yelled I'm a George Strait junkie
Ah-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country
