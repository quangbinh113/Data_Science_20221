Song Name: Skip This Part
You take your hand off mine
And keep your eyes on the floor
And I'm afraid that I've
I've seen this movie before
You cut the engine off
You say we need to talk
I feel like I'm frozen
You start turnin' the knife in slow motion
Split second memory rewind
Don't walk me up to the door
Don't say it's breakin' your heart
Before you say anymore
Can we just skip this part?
The one where you drive away
And I don't know what to do
And I watch your taillights fade
In a shirt that smells like you
Then cry on the floor in the dark
Can we just skip this part?
This ain't the scene where
I break down and beg you to stay
But it doesn't seem fair
For me to sit through the pain
Make you the villain
Who rides away with my heart
So baby listen
Can we just skip this part?
The one where you drive away
And I don't know what to do
And I watch your taillights fade
In a shirt that smells like you
Then cry on the floor in the dark
Can we just skip this part?
Where I convince myself
There's no one else for me
And find any excuse
Just to drive down your street
Cut to when cuts fade to scars
Can we just skip this part?
Can we skip to the part?
Where you're lyin' awake
And you realize that you
Made the biggest mistake
So you get in your car
And you speed down my street
And the rain starts to fall
And you fall to your knees
And I run down the stairs
Down the drive in bare feet
And you tell me
That you haven't slept in a week
And I jump in your arms
And it all fades to black
But I'm still in your car
And you don't love me back
Can we just skip this part?
Where you drive away
And I don't know what to do
And I watch your taillights fade
In a shirt that smells like you
Then cry on the floor in the dark
Can we just skip this part?
Where I convince myself (myself)
There's no one else for me
And find any excuse
Just to drive down your street
Cut to when cuts fade to scars
Can we just skip this part? (Can we just skip this part?)
Cut to you're back in my arms
Can we just skip this part?
