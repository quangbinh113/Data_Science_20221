Song Name: Strangers
You see the me no one else sees
And I see the you you don't show
You've read every page in my story
And I've read every chapter of your soul
There's no way I found you on my own
'Cause loving you's like breathing, don't you know?
How were we ever strangers?
Seems crazy to me now
Haven't I known you forever?
'Cause the thought of the days without
You and all your love
Have all but disappeared
I'll never be convinced, baby, that you weren't always here
How were we ever strangers?
You're the first call I make when the sky falls
You're the hand that I'm holding when it's blue
You're the curtains closed when I need to hide out
You're the light when I need it shining through
There's always been something I'm running to
There's never been a time it wasn't you
How were we ever strangers?
Seems crazy to me now
Haven't I known you forever?
'Cause the thought of the days without
You and all your love
Have all but disappeared
I'll never be convinced, baby, that you weren't always here
How were we ever strangers?
All I know is I've always known you
Ain't no way there was life before you
All I know is I've always known you (how were we ever strangers?)
Ain't no way, ain't no way
There's no way I found you on my own
'Cause loving you's like breathing, don't you know?
How were we ever strangers?
Seems crazy to me now
Haven't I known you forever?
'Cause the thought of the days without
You and all your love
Have all but disappeared
I'll never be convinced, baby, that you weren't always here
How were we ever strangers?
All I know is I've always known you
Ain't no way there was life before you
All I know is I've always known you
Ain't no way, ain't no way
How were we ever strangers?
