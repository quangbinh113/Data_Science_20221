Song Name: Take This Job and Shove It
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left
And took all the reasons
I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
I've been working in this factory
For nigh on fifteen years
All this time I watched my woman
Drowning in a pool of tears
And I've seen a lot of good folks die
That had a lot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right off my back
If I had the guts to say
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left
And took all the reasons
I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way
'Cause I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
Foreman he's a riggity dog
The line boss he's a fool
He has got a brand new flattop hair cut
Lord he thinks he's cool
One of these days I'm gonna blow my top
And that sucker he's gonna pay
Lord I can't wait to see their faces
When I get the nerve to say
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left
And took all the reasons
I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
Take this job and shove it
