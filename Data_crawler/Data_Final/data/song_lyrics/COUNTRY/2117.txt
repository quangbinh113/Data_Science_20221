Song Name: 'Til I Get It Right
I'll just keep on falling in love 'til I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird, hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough, I'm bound to learn to fly

So I'll just keep on falling in love 'til I get it right
My door to love has opened out more times than in

And I'm either fool, or wise enough to open it again
'Cause I'll never know what's beyond that mountain
'Til I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on falling in love 'til I get it right
If practice makes perfect, then I'm near 'bout as perfect
As I'll ever be in my life
So I'll just keep on falling in love 'til I get it right
