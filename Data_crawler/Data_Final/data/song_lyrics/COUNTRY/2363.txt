Song Name: Grey Ghost
As the autumn wind whispers through the tall and lonely pines
And the hour of fate is drawing close at hand
Free bird falling from the sky
Brings a bitter end to another southern man
But there's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain
Fast like them, the music is just a thin disguise
For the heartache and the fear of growin' old
Without the one that means the most it makes you realize
That you're the one that's left out in the cold
There's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain
Dealer of death has dealt the losing hand
And it's a cold fact the cards don't ever lie
Through the fire dream of things to come is such a [unverified] pain
When the memories are all that's left behind
There's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain
