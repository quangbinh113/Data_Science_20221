Song Name: I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool - Live At The Roy Acuff Theater Nashville, TN, 1981
I remember wearin' straight leg Levis
Flannel shirts even when they weren't in style
I remember singin' with Roy Rogers
At the movies when the west was really wild
I was listenin' to the Opry
When all of my friends
Were diggin' rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues
I was country when country wasn't cool
I remember circlin' the drive-in
Pullin' up and turnin' down George Jones
I remember when no one was lookin'
I was puttin' peanuts in my Coke
I took a lot of kiddin'
'Cause I never did fit in
Now look at everybody
Tryin' to be what I was then
I was country when country wasn't cool
Ooh, I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country, from my hat down to my boots
I still act, and look the same
What you see ain't nothin' new
I was country when country wasn't cool
They call us country bumpkins
For stickin' to our roots
I'm just glad we're in a country
Where we're all free to choose
I was country (I was country) when country wasn't cool
Hey, I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, and I was country, from my hat down to, oh, my boots
I still act, and look the same
What you see ain't nothin' new
'Cause I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't cool
