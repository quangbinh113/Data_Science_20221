Song Name: High Cotton
We didn't know the times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had
As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eye
And felt the love in mamma's hands
They kep us warm and kep us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back I understand
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
When Sunday mornin's rolled around
We dressed up in hand-me-downs
Just in time to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long it's been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old time there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old time there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
Walkin' in high cotton
