Song Name: Forged in Hell and Heaven Sent
It's been so long since I've seen you
And I'm not sure where to start
Was it yesterday or decades when we tore this town apart?
We'd start drinking in the afternoon, and close the bars all down
It's been too long since I've seen you
I'm so glad you're back in town
We went through so much together
You and me and all the gang
All those crazy death defiers, chasing storms and racing trains
It's a wonder there's a single one of us still left alive
To feast on best-forgotten memories
And toast the ones up in the skies
It's been so long since I've seen you
And I know you've been through hell
And it's taken its toll on you, and it's lessons served us well
But I still can see that sparkle in your eyes and in your smile
Glad you're back in town this evening
Have a seat and stay a while
So you had a little daughter?
I can see she's almost grown
And I guess she's had to grow up pretty fast
Time went racing past us, I've got two kids of my own
And I'm trying to make this time that we're in last
Not let the moments all slip past us
Answers to questions they'd never ask us
The things that kept us youngest came pounding down upon us
The whole world slipped out from under us
It's been too long since I've seen you
Wonder where the time all went
A whole decade before and two years since your accident
It's a miracle you're walking, even if a little bent
Guess the minutes we're together are forged in hell and heaven sent
Forged in hell and heaven sent
Forged in hell and heaven sent
Forged in hell and heaven sent
