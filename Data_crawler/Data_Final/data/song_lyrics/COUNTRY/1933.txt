Song Name: Around You
I been staring out the window
Talking to myself wondering if all your friends know
I want you all to myself
And I love it when you screaming my name
'Cause no one else can do it the same
Still remember when you flashed me
Hoping no one saw us getting jiggy in the back seat
Sparked another spliff and then she asked me
"What's a couple things that make you happy?"
Well, I just wanna be around you
Tell me when you're up for round two
Anything you ever wanna do
We can do it all over the room
'Cause I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around
Yeah, I just wanna be around you
Let me tell you, I'm tryna tell you
I'll eat you up like Italian
I love Italian
You know I love when you tell me you love me
You know I love when you tell me
Well, I was married to the game, I'm divorced now, yeah-yeah
Left Hollywood, I got a horse now, yeah-yeah
Everything I got that shit is yours now, yeah
Anything you want is yours now
And I just wanna be around you
Yeah, I'm back in my bag and I'm pouring a drink
I saw it all in my head
It went just like this
Yeah, I'm back in my bag
And it look like this, yeah
WelI, just wanna be around you
Tell me when you're up for round two
Anything you ever wanna do
We can do it all over the room
Well, I just wanna be around you
Tell me when you're up for round two
Anything you ever wanna do
We can do it all over the room
'Cause I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around you
I just wanna be around
Yeah, I just wanna be around you
Let me tell you, I'm tryna tell you
I'll eat you up like Italian
I love Italian
You know I love when you tell me you love me
You know I love when you tell me
