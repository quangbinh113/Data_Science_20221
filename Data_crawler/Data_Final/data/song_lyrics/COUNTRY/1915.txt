Song Name: Accidentally on Purpose
I know it's not your fault
You probably didn't even mean it at all
When you left my heart in pieces on the floor, yeah
Said you wanted more, yeah
Two feet at the door, mm, mm
You accidentally on purpose got me
Into falling for you (falling, falling)
The way you love me, the way you touch me
And it had me under, not that I could do
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
I thought I'd always be the kind of guy
That would never give all of me
But the day that you came knocking on my heart, yeah
I just fell apart
You have me from the start, mm, mm
You accidentally on purpose got me
Into falling for you (falling, falling)
The way you love me, the way you touch me
And it had me under, not that I could do
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
Didn't accidentally saw your place and moving with me
And you didn't accidentally tell your Mama that you love me
What was the purpose? Was it on purpose? Mm, mm
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
You accidentally on purpose got me into falling for you
