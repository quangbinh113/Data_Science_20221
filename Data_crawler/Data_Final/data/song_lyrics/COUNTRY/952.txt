Song Name: Sleeping Alone
Counting constellations on the popcorn ceiling
And staring at your picture on the wall
Rays of lonely moonlight slowly slice through the blinds
As the tears begin to fall
I'm tired of sleeping alone
And I just wanna be where you are
Tired of saying goodnight through the phone
And waking up each morning in the dark
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I'll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
Who I am trying to fool, baby?
I'm the one to blame
For the forces keeping us apart
I'm stubborn and I'm bold
And work's got me in a strangle hold
Keeping a vice around my heart
Indifference over distance don't fare well
Maybe a goodnight kiss from you
Could break me from my spell
'Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
And I just wanna be where you are
Tired of saying goodnight through the phone
And waking up each morning in the dark
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I'll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
Oh, here we go again
Off to never-never land
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I'll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I'll be with you soon tonight
If only in my dreams
