Song Name: Mama, Dolly, Jesus
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me, did you walk on water?
Do you know a woman named Jolene?
Can you claim me as your daughter?
Did you rock me to sleep?
Pray for my soul to keep?
No, no, no, I don't think so, so, so
You ain't Mama, Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones
I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama, Dolly or Jesus
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Those three got a lot in common
The kinds you wanna have a drink with
'Cause they love people at rock bottom
And they ain't gonna sit when there's a table to flip
So get off my back if you can't say that, that, that
You ain't Mama, Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So bring your bones and throw your stones
I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama, Dolly or Jesus
I can't pay my rent with your two cents
So keep it to yourself
And when I get lost, can't bear the cross
I know who can help (I know who can help)
Mama, Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones
I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama, Dolly or Jesus
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
