Song Name: Brokenheartsville
He wore that cowboy hat
To cover up his horns
Sweet-talking, forked tongue
Had a tempting charm
Before I turned around
That girl was gone
All I can say is
Bartender pour me something strong
Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will
I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
It was long and chrome sittin' in the lot
Fire engine red, that thing was hot
He revved it up, she waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell and so have I
Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will
I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will
I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
