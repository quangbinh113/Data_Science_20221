Song Name: One More Last Chance
She was standing at the front door
When I came home last night
Good Book in her left hand
And a rolling pin in her right
She said you've come home for the last time
With the whiskey on your breath
If you don't listen to my preaching, boy
I'm gonna have to beat you half to death
Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just good ol' boys, a-makin' noise
I ain't runnin' around on you
Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
First she hid my glasses
Because she knows that I can't see
She said you ain't going nowhere boy
Til you spend a little time with me
Then the boys called from the honky tonk
Said there's a party going on down here
Well she might have took my car keys
But she forgot about my old John Deere
Gimme just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just good ol' boys, making noise
I ain't runnin' round on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
Gimme just one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy, baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just good ol' boys, making noise
I ain't runnin' around on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
Give me just one more last chance
Before you say we're through
