Song Name: Break Up with Him
Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken
But I say, "Girl, you're taking too long
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him"
I know, you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart, look
Just tell him, it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him
And say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say
To get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon, you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him (break up with him)
You oughta hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do
But if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him
