Song Name: Ready or Not (feat. Sierra Ferrell)
Ready or not
Here comes the weekend
I'll be walking around, talking a lot
Lord knows I don't need a reason
To tell myself I'll be alright
I hope that it's true
I'm already out for the night
Why not make it two?
My God, ready or not
Ooh
Here comes the wedding
You wear the white, I'll say why not
(I'm so excited for you)
You're always forgetting
To tell yourself you'll be alright
Let's hope that it's true
You're already one of a kind
Why not make it two?
Ooh, ooh, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
So I say ready or not
Yeah, here comes the funeral
You wear the black and I'll pick the plot
It's all so unusual
Saying we'll all be alright
And you know it ain't true
It's always a matter of time
What else can you do?
We're already telling a lie
Why not make it two?
