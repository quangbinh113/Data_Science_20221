Song Name: One Of Y’all (feat. HARDY, Rhett Akins & The Cadillac Three)
One of y'all got some dirt on your dash
One of y'all drinks your beer too fast
One of y'all's mind's on a nine-pound bass
That you caught first cast last weekend
One of y'all hates your day-shift boss
One of y'all pissed your girlfriend off
One of y'all's got a truck that she tossed
A rock at and made you sleep in
And if you think my twang is the only thing country 'bout me
Then, buddy, take a better look
I've been around the county line more than a couple times
Didn't quite write it, but I read the book
I've been there, done that, I've seen it all
I've walked a country mile in your Red Wing boots
These songs about hicks took mе out the sticks
But don't get me wrong, I'm onе of y'all too
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too
One of y'all's got a chaw that you're pinchin'
One of y'all keeps a gun in the kitchen
In case you catch a backyard white tail slippin'
Huh, and me, I ain't no different
And if you think my twang is the only thing country 'bout me
Then, buddy, take a better look
I've been around the county line more than a couple times
Didn't quite write it, but I read the book
Been there, done that, I've seen it all
I've walked a country mile in your Red Wing boots
These songs about hicks took me out the sticks
But don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too
Ah, what you got, Jaren?
Every single one of y'all, Colorado, Arkansas
Mississippi, Wichita, I'm right there with ya
Turnin' up a fifth of Crown, drinkin' with the crowd
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, so if you
Think my twang is the only thing country 'bout me
Then, buddy, take a better look (come on)
I've been around the county line more than a couple times
Didn't quite write it, but I read the book
I been there, done that, I've seen it all
I've walked a country mile in your Red Wing boots
These songs about hicks took me out the sticks
But don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too
(Every single one of y'all, Colorado, Arkansas)
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too (Mississippi, Wichita, I'm right there with ya)
(Turnin' up a fifth of Crown, drinkin' with the crowd)
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm one of y'all too (that's what I'm talkin' 'bout)
