Song Name: Love Is Like a Butterfly
Love is like a butterfly (love is like a)
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (love is like)
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feelin' that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you, I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly (love is like a butterfly, as soft and gentle as a sigh)
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (love is like)
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly (love is like a)
As soft and gentle as a sigh (butterfly)
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (love is like)
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle
Thing (love is like a butterfly)
