Song Name: She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy
Plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate, Lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up the throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face
She ain't a foolin' me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
Is she the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
We ride back and forth 'til we run outta' light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft
Sit and talk with the radio on
She says she's got a dream and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weeny ride before I take her home
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me while I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
Is she the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
Well she ain't into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a deer, man her eyes light up
She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me, while I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She even kinda crazy about my farmer's tan
Is she he only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
