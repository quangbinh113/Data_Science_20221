Song Name: Where've You Been
Claire had all but given up
When she and Edwin fell in love
She touched his face and shook her head
In disbelief she sighed and said
In many dreams I've held you near
Now, at last, you're really here
Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away
He asked her for her hand for life
And she became a salesman's wife
He was home each night by eight
But one stormy evening he was late
Her frightened tears fell to the floor
Until his key turned in the door
Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away
They'd never spent a night apart
For sixty years she heard him snore
Now they're in a hospital
In seperate beds on different floors
Claire soon lost her memory
Forgot the names of family
She never spoke a word again
Then, one day, they wheeled him in
He held her hand and stroked her head
In a fragile voice she said
Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away
No, I'm just not myself when you're away
