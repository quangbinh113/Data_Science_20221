Song Name: You
Ooh
Baby, standing here with you
With your arms around my shoulders
We're dancing with the moon
And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me
I got you
For the rest of my days
In the sun on Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright, 'cause I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
Baby, looking in your eyes
It's like we're in slow motion
Just you and me tonight
And baby, you're leaning for a kiss
And I know, and I know, and I know
That it don't get better than this
'Cause I got you
For the rest of my days
In the sun on Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright, 'cause I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
I got forever
And I get all I ever need
'Cause I got you
I got you (you and only you)
For the rest of my days
In the sun on Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain (pouring rain)
'Cause I got you (you and only you)
For the rest of my life (rest of my life)
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright, 'cause I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
Baby, I got you
(You and only you)
(You and only you)
Uh-uh
(You, you and only you)
You and only you
