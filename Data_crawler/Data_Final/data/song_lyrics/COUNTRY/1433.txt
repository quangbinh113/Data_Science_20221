Song Name: Austin
These sleeping pills ain't working for me
I'm wide awake talking to these naked walls
They ain't got too much to say, I get tired
Then my mind goes out the gutter, the past and present run together
Kinda like they used to
I can't believe that you're not alone
Happy as hell that you done moved on
Heard he's a banker down in Austin
I thought you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone
Just don't make me believe these things I can't believe
It's 4:00 a.m., you never answer this late
If you do, it's unexpected, and if you do, it turns out great
But only for a little while, 'til you realize what you done
'Til you see that morning sun
You always tuck your tail when it's time to run
I can't believe that you're not alone
Happy as hell that you done moved on
I can't believe you're south of
Austin, you told me that you hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone
Just don't make me believe these things I can't believe
I can't believe that you're not alone
Happy as hell that you done moved on
I can't believe that you're leaving Austin
I knew you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone
Just don't make me believe these things I can't believe
Don't make me believe these things I can't
That I can't believe
