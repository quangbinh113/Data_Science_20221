Song Name: She Likes It (feat. Jake Scott)
She likes it when I wear a suit
Pick her favourite movie
When I open up, when she's talkin' to me
When I go get groceries, and I bring back flowers
And I rub her back for like half an hour
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she likes it when I-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she likes it when I-
Pour tequila 'cause she knows that
We about to have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimmin' those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissin' on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I- (mmm)
When I leave her a note
Make us reservations
Just because that girl's for celebratin'
When I already know what she's thinkin'
She don't have to say it, yeah
She likes it when I
Pour tequila 'cause she knows that
We about to have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimmin' those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissin' on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I- (mmm)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she likes it when I-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love it when we-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she likes it when I-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she likes it when I-
Pour tequila 'cause she knows that
We about to have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimmin' those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissin' on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I-
She likes it when I- (mmm)
