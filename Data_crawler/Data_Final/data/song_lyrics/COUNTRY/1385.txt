Song Name: What A High
The summer moon is here again
Reveals the freckles on your skin
Let's ride this breeze wherever it blows
Yeah we've been leaning on each other
Weathered the storm been taking cover
It feels so good not being so low
One look from you is better than
Anything else I've tried
What a high
What a night tonight
It's a feeling it's real
Got one hand off the wheel I could fly
Oh, what a rush
That's what your lovin' does
When you're next to me
In the passenger seat as the world rolls by
What a high
We found a perfect harmony
Your hands are drumming on your blue jeans
I feel the rhythm down in my soul
Oh, what a high
What a night tonight
It's a feeling it's real
Got one hand off the wheel I could fly
Oh, what a rush
That's what your lovin' does
When you're next to me
In the passenger seat as the world rolls by
Oh, what a high
One look from you is better than
Anything else I've tried
What a high
What a night tonight
It's a feeling it's real
Got one hand off the wheel I could fly
Oh, what a rush
That's what your lovin' does
When you're next to me
In the passenger seat as the world rolls by
Oh, what a high
