Song Name: Pull Me Under
Pull me under to save me
Undo the knots that I'm in
Lift me up just to break me again and again
Shine a light on my darkness
Undo the costs of my sins
Lift me up just to hate me again and again
This life is but a dream
Not always what it seems

Pull me under
Save yourself
I'm the one who needs the help
It's all because of me
That you haunt me in my dreams
Give it all just to hold you
Take away all of your pain
Lift you up like an angel again and again
I cling so desperately
To what we used to be
Pull me under
Save yourself
I'm the one who needs the help
It's all because of me
That you haunt me in my dreams
So, pull me under
Save yourself
I'm the one who needs the help
It's all because of me
That you haunt me in my dreams
