Song Name: I'm Comin' Over
We say, "Goodbye, see you around"
We turn our backs, then turn back around
We break up, we make up, and we make love
We can't seem to let go, girl
So I'm comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'?
Just when I think movin' on's gettin' closer
I'm comin' over
I'm all alone, but you're on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you're at home
Who knows what we are in the morning?
All I know is I want you
So I'm comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on's gettin' closer
I'm comin' over
Ooh, I'm comin' over
Yeah, we said that we're done, and I know that it's late
But you already know, I'm on my way
I'm comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire that's burnin'?
I'm comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'?
Just when I think movin' on's gettin' closer
I'm comin' over
Ooh, I'm comin' over
