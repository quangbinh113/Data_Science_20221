Song Name: Supernova
Well, you grow up, pack it all up
In a hand-me-down car
Throw out a wave and you just can't wait
For your life to start
You move miles away from your parents
And then you try so hard not to be like them
But then it hits you one day that you miss them like hell
You want nothing more than to go home again
Time is like a shooting star
A supernova in the dark
You'd do anything to make it last
But it all goes by so fast
Curly hair and matchbox cars
Leave the lights on 'cause you're afraid of the dark
Reaching for my hand when you cross the road
You are my sunshine and right now you're all mine
I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Time is like a shooting star
A supernova in the dark
You'd do anything to make it last
But it all goes by so fast
Be right here next to me now
And we'll let this world spin 'round and 'round
Kiss me and let's just talk here for a while
Time is like a shooting star
A supernova in the dark
You'd do anything to make it last
But it all goes by so fast
