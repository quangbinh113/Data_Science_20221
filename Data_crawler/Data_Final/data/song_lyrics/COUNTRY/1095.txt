Song Name: Death Row
Just last week I went to prison
To see some boys down on death row
Brought some guitars and my buddies
To play some songs I thought they'd know
I could feel myself trembling
When I shook one of their hands
I thought that he would be a monster
Turns out he's a whole lot like I am
Yeah, we talked hunting, we talked fishing
Like I do with boys back home
How Jesus is the ticket
And narrow is the road
About how all we need is forgiveness
'Fore we see them streets of gold
Yeah, I learned a lot 'bout livin' from them boys down on death row
One of 'em name's was Johnny
Ain't touched the grass in thirty years
Maybe I ain't supposed to feel sorry no
But it 'bout brought me to tears
Then it hit me, we're all human
Ain't always proud of what we done
Everybody's days are numbered
Only difference is, they all know which ones
We talked hunting, we talked fishing
Like I do with boys back home
How Jesus is the ticket
And narrow is the road
About how all we need is forgiveness
'Fore we see them streets of gold
Yeah, I learned a lot 'bout livin' from them boys down on death row
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
One of 'em sang, "Amazing Grace", how sweet the sound
With one hand raised, and one foot chained to the ground
Yeah, he sang it like he knew he'd just been found
Yeah, that next week, they laid him six feet down
Oh, oh, I can't say that he's in Heaven, who am I to judge his soul?
But Jesus don't play favorites, sayin' a name that He don't know
Yeah, I learned that and then some, from the boys down on death row
I learned all that and then some, from the boys down on death row
