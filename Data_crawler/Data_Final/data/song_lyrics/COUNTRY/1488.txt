Song Name: Waiting for the Fall
Gonna kill the headlights
Like I've done a hundred times
I'm rollin' up to your house, watchin' you, sneakin' out
Tonight
Mascara runnin' down your face as you're runnin' down the driveway
Eighteen years come and gone
Girl you know we ain't got long
'Fore you have to fly away
Let's take this summer
Burn a little rubber
Girl let's give it everything
With the glow of the radio
Off of some county road
Steamin' up the backseat
It's gonna hurt like hell in September but right now we've got it all
Waiting for the fall
Straight A's and Daddy's rules
Got ya movin' off to school
And I'm blue-collared, bustin' knuckles, back-breakin', sweat and muscle
That's just what I'm born to do
So let's take this summer
Burn a little rubber
Girl let's give it everything
With the glow of the radio
Off of some county road
Steamin' up the backseat
It's gonna hurt like hell in September but right now we've got it all
Waitin' for the fall
Woahhhhh
Waitin' for the Fall
I'd never hold you back
I'd never drag you down
So till the leaves turn red
All I want right now
Is to take this summer
Burn a little rubber
Girl let's give it everything
With the glow of the radio
Off of some county road
Steamin' up the backseat
Let's take this summer
Burn a little rubber
Girl let's give it everything
With the glow of the radio
Off of some county road
Steamin' up the backseat
It's gonna hurt like hell in September but right now we've got it all
It's gonna hurt like hell in September but right now we've got it all
Waitin' for the fall
Waitin' for the fall
