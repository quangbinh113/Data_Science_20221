Song Name: Fuss & Fight
I've been working like a slave
Ain't got no money
Done spent it all on bills
Got a girl at home that I call baby
And she does not love me when I get stoned
The memories they just won't leave
The secrets I'm gonna take to the grave with me
I got bills that ain't paid, and pain that don't heal
I don't know how much longer I can deal, uh
Is there something wrong, baby?
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad, then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you
Well, my grandma thinks the devil runs me
And the cross on my neck says, "No, hell no"
I got the Holy Spirit
And Baptist bones
A couple rusty strings with some nasty tones
So please don't bring your evil around me
Sittin' and lyin' through your crooked teeth
I gotta go now, baby, so write it down
And I'll read it when my time runs out
Is there something wrong, baby?
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad, then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you, oh, oh, oh
To fuss and fight with you
Girl, you know that I love you
And you know that I care
But babydoll, this fussing and fighting is for the birds, yeah
Is there something wrong, baby?
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad, then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got the time
Is there something wrong, baby?
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad, then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you
To fuss and fight with you
Don't want to fuss and fight
Don't want to fuss and fight
