Song Name: Five More Minutes
Eight years old, couple cane poles sittin' down by the creek
Lines in the water, watchin' those bobbers, seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yellin', "Supper's hot! Ya'll come and get it!"
We yelled, "Five more minutes"
At 16, it was 12:03, standin' at her front door
And Katie's dad said "Midnight", but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flippin' on and off interuptin' that good night kissin'
We wanted five more minutes
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops of the good stuff, the good times
Ah, but they just keep on flyin'
Right on by like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes
At 18, turned my helmet in and walked to the 50-yard line
Just the coach and me after we lost 18 to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket
"Can't you give me five more minutes?"
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops of the good stuff, the good times
Ah, but they just keep on flyin'
Right on by like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes
At 86, my grandpa said, "There's angels in the room"
All the family gathered 'round, we knew the time was comin' soon
With so much left to say I prayed, "Lord I ain't finished"
"Just give us five more minutes"
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flyin'
Right on by Like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah, sometimes this ol' life will leave you wishin'
That you had five more minutes
Five more minutes
