Song Name: Mind On You
Well, baby, you're a wildfire
That'll light me up, little out of control
Yeah, you know
Baby, you're a tall drink, little top shelf that'll get me going, hold on
We both know that road that we're goin' down
And right now, all I can think about
I got my mind on you and you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two-lane and we cuttin' through the night
Got you high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves, like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
Slide a little closer, babe
Wanna get your pretty little head on my shoulder and get closer
Girl, you know I love the way
You slip your hand under my shirt, then it's over, go slower
We both know that road that we're goin' down
Right now, all I can think about
I got my mind on you and you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two-lane and we cuttin' through the night
Got you high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves, like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you, mmh yeah
I got my mind on you and you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two-lane and we cuttin' through the night
Got you high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves, like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you and you on my mind (I got my mind on you, I got my mind on you)
(I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you) I got my mind on you, yeah
(Got my mind on you)
