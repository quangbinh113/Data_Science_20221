Song Name: Big Time
Good mornin' kisses, givin' you all mine
Pull back the curtains, show me the sunshine
Needin' this coffee, needin' some nature
Need it right now, it can't wait until later
We're always busy, baby, not this time
Lay in the tall grass, talkin' with your eyes
Talkin' with your eyes before we knew we were
Thinkin' the same things, I'm a believer
And I'm losin', I'm losin', I've left it behind
Guess I had to be losin' to get here on time
And I'm livin', I'm lovin', I've loved long before
And I'm loving you big time, I'm lovin' you more
Take to the lake, playing "Lady in Red"
Hangin' onto every word that you said
Stayin' up all night out by the fire
Singin' your song now, you know I'm a crier
And I'm losin', I'm losin', I've left it behind
Guess I had to be losin' to get here on time
And I'm livin', I'm lovin', I've loved long before
And I'm loving you big time, I'm lovin' you more
And I'm losin', I'm losin', I've left it behind
Guess I have to be losin' to get here on time
And I'm livin', I'm lovin', I've loved long before
Yeah, I'm loving you big time, I'm lovin' you more
Lovin' you big time
I'm lovin' you big time
Lovin' you big time
Lovin' you big time
