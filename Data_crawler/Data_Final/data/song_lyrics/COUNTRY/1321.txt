Song Name: Landslide - Live from Nashville
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
But the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too, yeah, yeah
Do you know it?
All right sing it with me
Here we go
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yeah I'm getting older too
So take this love and take it down
And if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And you saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well maybe, well maybe, well maybe
The landslide will bring you down
