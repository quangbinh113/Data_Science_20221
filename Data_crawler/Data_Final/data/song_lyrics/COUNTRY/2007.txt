Song Name: DOIN' MY BEST
2020 was a weird year
Album dropped at a weird time
Ain't the homecoming queen but better believe I cried
And therapy for one turned
Into therapy for two
When you get married that young
You got a lotta shit you gotta get through
If I said I had it all together, I'd be lyin'
But I'll die tryin'
I'm doin' my best
I'm lettin' the rest roll off my shoulders, baby
Don't always get it right
Hey, and that's alright
That's what I'm learnin' lately, I keep
Growin' up, I keep
Rollin' up my sleeves and I think
That showin' up is good enough for me
I was friends with a pop star
I put 'em on track four, but
Wish I could take it back, I would've nevеr asked
If I knew we wouldn't talk anymorе
Sometimes I try to say the right thing
And it comes out wrong
And Twitter kicked my ass, now it's one less app on my iPhone, yeah
If I said I had it all together, I'd be lyin'
Yeah, but I'll die tryin'
I'm doin' my best
I'm lettin' the rest roll off my shoulders, baby
Don't always get it right
Hey, and that's alright
That's what I'm learnin' lately, I keep
Growin' up, I keep
Rollin' up my sleeves and I think
That showin' up is good enough for me
I live in my head 'til the sun's up
Even I can admit that it's fucked up
And you're pushing for perfect your whole life
And it didn't work out
But, damn it, I tried
I'm doin' my best
I'm lettin' the rest roll off my shoulders, baby
Don't always get it right (I'm doin' my)
And that's alright (I'm doin' my best)
That's what I'm learnin' lately, I keep (I'm doin' my)
Growin' up, I keep (I'm doin' my best)
Rollin' up my sleeves and I think (I'm doin' my)
That showing' up is good enough for me (I'm doin' my best)
(I'm doin' my)
(I'm doin' my best)
(I'm doin' my)
(I'm doin' my best)
