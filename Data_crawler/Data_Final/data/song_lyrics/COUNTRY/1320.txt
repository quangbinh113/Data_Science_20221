Song Name: Sunrise Tells The Story - Acoustic
There's a half cigarette swimming in red wine
The record's still spinning, the scene of the crime
It's looking like a tornado 'bout to come crashing through the door
Can't say what happened, but one thing's for sure
The moon saw it all through a thin piece of glass
And the stars must have blushed when you kissed me like that
We can't hide the evidence
It's scattered everywhere in all its naked glory
The night knows the truth
The sunrise tells the story
The last I recall, it was a quarter 'til two
We headed back to my place like two strangers do
Who would've thought that we'd end up all tangled up together?
The night was a witness to our sweet surrender
And the moon saw it all through a thin piece of glass
And the stars must have blushed when you kissed me like that
We can't hide the evidence
It's scattered everywhere in all its naked glory
The night knows the truth
The sunrise tells the story
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it a book or a chapter, a few words on a page?
Don't know where it's going, I just want you to stay
And the moon saw it all through a thin piece of glass
And the stars must have blushed when you kissed me like that
We can't hide the evidence
It's scattered everywhere in all its naked glory
The night knows the truth
But the sunrise tells the story
Oh, and I know the truth
The sunrise
Tells the story
