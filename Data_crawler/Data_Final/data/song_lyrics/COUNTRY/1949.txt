Song Name: Broadway Girls (feat. Morgan Wallen)
2 a.m. at a Broadway bar
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
And you know
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone, and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, "You don't have to join in", she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kinda lost and baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
Oh, there's two things that you're gonna find out (oh-oh)
They don't love you, and they only love you right now (right now)
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Leave 'em Broadway girls alone
They town just told me, "Don't trust 'em"
Broadway girls a trap (oh-oh)
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back (yeah-yeah)
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever, they treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out (oh-oh)
They don't love you, and they only love you right now (right now)
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Broadway girls, Broadway girls)
Them Broadway girls alone (Broadway girls, Broadway girls)
Leave 'em Broadway girls alone
Oh-whoa, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh-whoa
But I told 'em that I'm savage, they just tryna tell me
There's two things that you're gonna find out (oh-oh)
They don't love you, and they only love you right now (right now)
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out (oh-oh)
They don't love you, and they only love you right now (right now)
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Broadway girls, Broadway girls)
Them Broadway girls alone (Broadway girls, Broadway girls)
Leave 'em Broadway girls alone
'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girl
'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girls alone
'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girls
Broadway girls, Broadway girls alone
