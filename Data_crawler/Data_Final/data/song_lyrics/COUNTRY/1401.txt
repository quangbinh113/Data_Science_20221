Song Name: Be The Whiskey
It might be selfish
But I might be jealous
Of you leaning on that drink
Instead of leaning up on me
Maybe I just wish, I wish
You'd let me be the whiskey
Southern Comfort, baby
That go down easy on your lips
Smooth sip to forget that bitter memory
Toss me back and kiss me, baby
I'll bring that heat that you need
If you let me be the whiskey
(Let me be the whiskey, baby)
Let me be the whiskey
(Let me be the whiskey)
That top shelf special, but don't need no warnin'
That all night bender, you don't regret in the mornin'
I'll be fire, I'll be honey, I'll be whatever you want me
Baby, just think
I can be the whiskey
Southern Comfort, baby
That go down easy on your lips
Smooth sip to forget that bitter memory
Toss me back and kiss me, baby
I'll bring that heat that you need
If you let me be the whiskey
Let me be, let me be, baby
Let me be the whiskey
Let me be, let me be
That buzz, that high
That feeling right
You don't let go all night
Yeah
Let me be the whiskey
Southern Comfort, baby
That go down easy on your lips
Smooth sip to forget that bitter memory
Toss me back and kiss me, baby
I'll bring that heat that you need
If you let me be the whiskey
Let me be, let me be, baby
Let me be the whiskey
Let me be, let me be
Oh, I can be your whiskey, baby (let me be, let me be, baby)
I can be your whiskey (let me be, let me be)
Let me be the whiskey
Oh-oh, ooh, yeah
