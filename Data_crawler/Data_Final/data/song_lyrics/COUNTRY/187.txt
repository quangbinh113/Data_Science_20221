Song Name: Rumor
Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughin' and tap me on the shoulder
Makin' a motion like "Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holdin' ya
Even when the song is over
There's a rumor goin' round about me and you
Stirrin' up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Well I can shut 'em down, tell 'em all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them som'in' to talk about
There's a rumor goin' round 'bout me and you
Stirrin' up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talkin', girl
Or should we just make 'em stop?
There's a rumor goin' round 'bout me and you
Stirrin' up our little town (the last week) the last week or two
So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
I feel, and you feel it too?
There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it-
Make it true?
What d'you say we make it true?
