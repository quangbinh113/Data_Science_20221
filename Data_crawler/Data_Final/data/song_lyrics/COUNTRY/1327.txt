Song Name: Wildfire - Acoustic
I met her on a Monday night, singing karaoke, yeah
I played it cool like I didn't see her notice me, whoa
When she grabbed that mic, hopped up on that stage, rocked that song she sang
And I was like, "Whoa-ooh, girl, I didn't know that I would feel this way"
She had me burning like a wildfire
Those flames kept getting higher
Burning me up, burning me up
I just couldn't get enough
Mesmerized by the look in her eyes
Not knowing wrong from right
All 'cause she had my heart
Burning like a wildfire
Burning like a wild
Me and her got a little crazy
Heading out to a burned down factory at 3 a.m
What I was feeling, I couldn't explain
'Cause I ain't never felt that way, yeah
She was grinning 'cause she felt the same and it all started that day
She had me burning like a wildfire
Those flames kept getting higher
Burning me up, burning me up
I just couldn't get enough
Mesmerized by the look in her eyes
Not knowing wrong from right
All 'cause she had my heart
Burning like a wildfire
Burning like a wild
And to this day, she still gets to me
The way she loves me makes it hard to breathe
She had me burning like a wildfire
Those flames kept getting higher
Burning me up, burning me up
I just couldn't get enough
Mesmerized by the look in her eyes
Not knowing wrong from right
All 'cause she had my heart
Burning like a wildfire
Burning like a wildfire
