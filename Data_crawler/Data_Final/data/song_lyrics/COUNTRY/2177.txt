Song Name: 4 X 4 Play
You got a lit fuse, let loose look in your eye
Like you wanna go and get a little wild tonight, oh-oh
I got me a turned out two-tonne roof for one
Put your name on the shotgun seat in the front, let's roll
Yeah, let's go
Yeah, and I know what gets you right you
And there's a cornfield waiting on us, come on
Take it off, off of that highway
Turn me on, and I'll let you drive, babe
You can take it fast as you want to
Girl, a little dirty looks damn good on you
Start me up, Stones on the radio
Girl I love, love it when you let go
Long way, short way, ain't no wrong way
To get off on some four by four play
Girl
So match your hands on the wheel, got a sexy touch
It's enough to make me and my Chevy blush, oh Lord
Let's go get off the blacktop, get going along
Just driving through the mud, cutting 'cross the crops, get gone, yeah
Let's get miles and miles off-road
Honey, out here anything goes, come on
Take it off, off of that highway
Turn me on, and I'll let you drive, babe
You can take it fast as you want to
Girl, a little dirty looks damn good on you
Start me up, Stones on the radio
Girl I love, love it when you let go
Long way, short way, ain't no wrong way
To get off on some four by four play
Long way or the short way
There ain't no wrong way, oh no, no
Turn it up, make the sun stop
Go and get it, girl, don't stop
Take it off-road, take it off-road, take it off
Take it off, off the highway
Get off on some four by four play
Take it off, off the highway
Get off on some four by four play
Take it off, off the highway
Get off on some four by four play
Take it off, off the highway
Get off on some four by four play
Take it off, off of that highway
Turn me on, and I'll let you drive, babe
You can take it fast as you want to
Girl, a little dirty looks damn good on you
Start me up, Stones on the radio
Girl I love, love it when you let go
Long way, short way, ain't no wrong way
To get off on some four by four play
To get off on some four by four play
To get off on some four by four play
Girl
