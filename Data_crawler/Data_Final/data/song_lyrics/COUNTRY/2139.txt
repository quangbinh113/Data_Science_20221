Song Name: All I See Is You
A storm's runnin' through the Midwest
Like a bandit out on the loose
And all the clouds are black as nightfall
But all I see is you
And rain's pourin' through the windowpanes
And the cracks of this roof
Tea's boilin' from the spout of the pot
But all I see is you, yeah
It's like the nights in Salt Lake City
Where the snow fell down too soon
People laughed and howled from their beers
But all I could see was you
And I remember our first night abroad
As the sun traded shifts with the moon
It was a lot to take in for some eyes from East Texas
But all I could see was you
'Cause all I ever see is you
I'll make my way to the doctor one day
When my eyes don't work like they should
Just read the letters from large down to small
But all I'll see is you
Then when I'm old and weathered
From the winds of a life that consumed
I pray to God the day I'll find my deathbed
All I'll see is you
'Cause all I wanna see is you
Every day
And oh, oh, oh, I will wait a few more nights
But until that time
All I see is you
A storm's runnin' through the Midwest
Like a bandit out on the loose
And all the clouds are black as nightfall
But all I see is you
And rain's pourin' through the windowpanes
And the cracks of this roof
Tea's boilin' from the spout of the pot
But all I see is you
'Cause all I ever see is you
