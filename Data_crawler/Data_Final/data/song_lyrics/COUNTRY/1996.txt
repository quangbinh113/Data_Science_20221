Song Name: Right On Time
I got a friend who just got married, again
I don't know what the hell that girl does
I can't even find a plus one
My momma says I'm just too picky
I guess, but isn't that better than selling life short
For someone that you're settling for
There's nothing wrong
If it takes a bit longer
To figure it out
Least that's what I tell myself
People make it look so easy
In and out of love so fast
I don't give it up that easy
'Cause I won't put my heart through that
I'm either optimistic or a little naive
I'm everywhere and nowhere that I thought I would be
30 years later and I gotta believe that I'm
Either late to the party or right on time
Let's do the math if I met somebody
Tonight, take it slow let a whole year go by us
And then the stars don't line up
Well, that'd be 365 days, 52 weeks, 12 months
That I spent just to find out
One person ain't the right one for me
Whatever that means
People make it look so easy
In and out of love so fast
I don't give it up that easy
'Cause I won't put my heart through that
I'm either optimistic or a little naive
I'm everywhere and nowhere that I thought I would be
30 years later and I gotta believe that I'm
Either late to the party or right on time
Late to the party or right on time
I don't know why I'm
Impatient sometimes, when I
Know that I'm probably fine
I hope I'm fine
People make it look so easy
In and out of love so fast
I don't give it up that easy
'Cause I won't put my heart through that
I'm either optimistic or a little naive
I'm everywhere and nowhere that I thought I would be
30 years later and I gotta believe that I'm
Either late to the party or right on time, yeah
Late to the party or right on time
Late to the party or right on time
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Late to the party or right on time
