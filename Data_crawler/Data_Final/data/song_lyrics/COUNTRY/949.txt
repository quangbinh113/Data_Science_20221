Song Name: Front Porch
There are no wrong roads
And no window stays closed
Love is always sad when it fades
The glass is better stained anyways
If never you find what you're looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Come on back to the front porch
Whatever you've done it doesn't matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back to the front porch
We carved a story in these boards
Watching life go back and forth
You take it all for granted, then you leave
And then it takes a while to realize what you need
If never you find what you're looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Come on back to the front porch
Whatever you've done it doesn't matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back
I took the long way
Looking for the shortcut
To find out that this place
Was made of the best of
If never you find what you're looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Oh, come on back to the front porch
Whatever you've done it doesn't matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back
Oh, come on back, come on back to the front porch
