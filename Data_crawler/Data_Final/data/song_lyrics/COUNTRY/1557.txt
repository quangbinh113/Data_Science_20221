Song Name: If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time
If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the night spots, dance, drink beer and wine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
There ain't no use to tarry, so let's start out tonight
We'll spread joy, oh boy, oh boy, and we'll spread it right
We'll have more fun, baby, all the way down the line
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along your Cadillac, leave m'old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
Yes, we'll go honky tonkin', make every club in town
We'll go to the park where it's dark, we won't fool around
But if you run short of money, I'll run short of time
'Cause you with no more money, honey, I've no more time
If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the night spots, dance, drink beer and wine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
