Song Name: Milk and Cookies ('till Santa's Gone)
Now I'm only five years old
I've gotta do just what I'm told
Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Is there something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
Now I know what he like for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in?
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
But could there be something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can get it all under that Christmas tree
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check now I don't recall
The milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I've got it all
The stockings hung along the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
But could there be something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree
Get that harmonica under there
And we can fit a guitar under there
A cowboy hat, bicycle maybe
Don't know what he's gonna do with that horse
