Song Name: Summer Nights
It's summer nights, baby
Whoa! Yeah
Come on ladies, it's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on
Flip-flop tan and some white sand
I know the perfect spot
Well the sunset better set soon so we can get in the mood
Things start gettin' all heated up when it starts gettin' cool
Yeah
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Come on, oh, yeah, yeah
Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let them teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies, y'all keep doing y'alls thing
'Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream
The sun is getting low, there it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon (yeah)
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Oh, it's a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona, y'all
Well, it's wild and it's free
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights (come on)
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Yeah, oh
Are you ready (are you ready)
For some summer nights?
Yeah, baby
Summer nights
It's summer nights
Come on
