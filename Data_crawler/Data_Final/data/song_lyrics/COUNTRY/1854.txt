Song Name: Good Day
I think I'll start my mornin' with Sinatra
And let those blue eyes speak to me
Skip all the things that I don't want to
And let my mind wander free
It's forty-two, cold and raining
And something's got me thinkin' maybe
It's gonna be a good day
I don't know why but it feels like
Love's comin' my way
And the sun ain't even shinin'
If the world gonna keep on spinnin'
Let it keep spinnin' on my way
I got a feelin'
It's gonna be a good day
Look at the leaves and how they turnin'
Just like this smile here on my face
Life is a song that I'm still learnin'
And I ain't hear the music fallin' right into place
It's gonna be a good day
I don't know why but it feels like
Love's comin' my way
And the sun ain't even shinin'
If the world gonna keep on spinnin'
Let it keep spinnin' on my way
I got a feelin'
It's gonna be a good day, oh
Well, maybe it's the thought that love
Is right around the corner, I don't know
I don't really need a reason
When I got this happy feelin' in my soul, oh
It's gonna be a good day
It's gonna be a good day
And if the world gonna keep on spinnin'
Let it keep spinnin' on my way
I got a feelin'
It's gonna be a good day
It's gonna be a good day
Oh, oh
Yeah
Good day
