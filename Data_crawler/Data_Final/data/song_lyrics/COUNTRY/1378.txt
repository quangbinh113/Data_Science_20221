Song Name: How You Love Someone
Do you stand in the driveway and wait 'til the car is gone?
Do you have to watch that movie every time it's on?
Can you sleep alone as long as the porch light's on?
Yeah, I wanna know how you love someone
Would you learn to like Hank Williams and red wine?
Do you start talking and lose all track of time?
When that song comes on, do you take it as a sign?
Oh, I wanna know how you love someone
I wanna know how it sounds
When the words are coming out of your mouth
And your heart has finally figured it out
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone
When you go back home, has it always been too long?
Is nothing really true 'til you tell it to your mom?
Do you fight just to fight or are you alright being wrong?
Come on, I wanna know how you love someone
I wanna know how it sounds
When the words are coming out of your mouth
And your heart has finally figured it out
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Does your laugh get a little higher?
Does the weight of the world get a little lighter?
Do you let go first or do you hold on too long?
I wanna see what it's like
When you're looking into somebody's eyes
And you're falling and you mean it this time
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Oh, something tells me the way that I couldn't get enough
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone
I wanna know how you love someone
