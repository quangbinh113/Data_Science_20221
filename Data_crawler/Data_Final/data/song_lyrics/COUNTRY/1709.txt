Song Name: That's the Way That the World Goes 'Round
Oh, I got glue on my strings
That's the way that the world goes 'round
I know a guy that's got a lot to lose
He's a pretty nice fellow, kinda confused
Got muscles in his head, ain't never been used
Thinks he own half of this town
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose
Then he takes her out to dinner, buys her new clothes
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
I was sitting in the bathtub, counting my toes
When the radiator broke, water all froze
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown
I was crying, "Ice cubes", hoping I'd croak
When the sun come through the window, the ice all broke
I stood up and laughed, thought it was a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
