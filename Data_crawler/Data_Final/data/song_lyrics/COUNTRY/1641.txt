Song Name: TRUCK BED
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve, when she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
She said, "Don't come home if you go to the bar"
I said, "Okay baby", then got drunk out in the yard
2 a.m. I knock-knock, knocked up on the door
But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more
Yeah, she meant business this time
I can't believe my bloodshot eyes
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve, when she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
I used that empty bag of corn to rest my head
A camo jacket for a blanket, then passed out like I was dead
Still got one heck of a buzz
If I look a train wreck, it's because
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve, when she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
Yes, I did
I can't believe I gotta be at work at 9
That fuckin' bird's about to catch this 45
Oh, I guess if this really is goodbye
At least I took my boots off this time
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve, when she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve, when she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
