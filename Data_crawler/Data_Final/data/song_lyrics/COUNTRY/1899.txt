Song Name: Different Man
Born a life, 9 to 5
Gonna work 'til you die
Gonna hurt
Gonna learn to take it like a man
Find a girl, make a wife
Dig a fence, paint it white
What if I had another plan
What if I was made for the stage
What if I was made for the lights
What if I was chosen to write the stories
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different
Would I wanna be different?
Man, it's cold, crack of dawn
Hear that old rooster crow
Coffees on, and it ain't never gonna change
Another night, same fight
Same girl, same guy
What if I wanna break the mundane
What if I was made for the stage
What if I was made for the lights
What if I was chosen to write the stories
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different
Would I wanna be different
Feels like I'm stuck in this rut
Tryin' to spin my way out, I can't figure it out
Don't know how
How I'm supposed to tell mama and daddy
Without them mad at me but I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
What if I was made for the stage
What if I was made for the lights
What if I was chosen to write the stories
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different
Would I wanna be different
I wanna be different
I wanna be different
