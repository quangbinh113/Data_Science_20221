Song Name: Stand For Myself
I understand why you
Close your eyes
Why you deaf your ears
Oh I realize now
You wanna feel nothing
Just like I was
A coward in the shadows
No view from above
Now I'm alive
It's hard to explain
It took this much time
And took this much pain
You can get here if you're willing
Let go of yourself for a new beginning
It was easier to sit, than stand for myself
It was easy to give in, than stand for myself
I know why you hide away
Why you keep so quiet
Mind what you say now
You think you're too much
Too hot to handle
You're stronger than anyone
But still so fragile
It was easier to sing, than stand for myself
It was easy to give in, than stand for myself
It was hard enough to go and live on
I was so tired
Trying to belong
I was lost in the city
You could see it in my eyes
But I was still a dreamer
In the middle of the night
Now I'm a-live, alive
I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm a-live, alive
I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive
I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive
I'm alive! Ooh Yeah!
Ooh ooh
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
