Song Name: Already Crazy
Ain't the first time I got high off, of summer time green eyes
Ain't the first fight had me, reckless down the highway
Ain't the first to drive me wild, just the first one in a while
Ain't the first we're fine, until it all goes sideways
It went right off the rails, took the wind out of my sails
But oh well, oh well
I was already crazy, already unglued
You can't be that stupid, to think it started with you
I was already bitter, I was already sad
No, it wasn't you leavin'
That made me go mad
You didn't break me, baby
I was already crazy
Ain't the last time I'll show up
Drunk enough to throw a punch
Ain't the last guy, that I'll cry about in public
And I can't live without you, but I wish I never had you
I hate you, I love you, I hate you
But I love you (I love you)
I was already crazy, already unglued
You can't be that stupid
To think it started with you
I was already bitter, I was already sad
No, it wasn't you leavin'
That made me go mad
You didn't break me, baby
I was already crazy for you
I was already crazy, outta my mind
But you're the first if I don't have him
Damn it, I'll die
I was already livin' like, I had already crashed
No, it wasn't you leavin'
That made me go mad
You didn't break me, baby
I was already crazy
Ooh, I was already crazy, mm
