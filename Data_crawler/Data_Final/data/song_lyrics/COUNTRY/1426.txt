Song Name: You Ain't (Ft. Meghan Patrick)
You could be L.A.
Toes in the ocean
Skin turnin' golden
Under the sun
Or maybe Montana
Pickin' wild flowers
Out on the range
Where the horses run
I don't where you are
But I know you ain't
Shotgun in my ride
Sleeping on your side
Of this California king size bed
An' you ain't dancin' in my shirt
An' pullin' me in with no words
Turnin' my lips your shade of ruby red
Oh, I wish I could say that you'll come around
An' you're out there thinkin' about me now
But you ain't
Sometimes I wake up
Swear I see you smilin'
Then I open my eyes an'
An' you're still long gone
Without a warning
Not even a goodbye
Was it really that easy for you to move on
I don't know who you think you are
But I know you ain't
Shotgun in my ride
Sleeping on your side
Of this California king size bed
An' you ain't dancin' in my shirt
An' pullin' me in with no words
Turnin' my lips your shade of ruby red
Oh, I wish I could say that you'll come around
An' you're out there thinkin' about me now
But you ain't
Oh yeah, time is a healer
But I ain't no saint
If you ever come back
I'm tellin' you you're too late
And you ain't
Shotgun in my ride
Sleeping on your side
Of this California king size bed
An' you ain't dancin' in my shirt
An' pullin' me in with no words
Turnin' my lips your shade of ruby red
Oh, I wish I could say that you'll come around
An' you're out there thinkin' about me now
But you ain't
You ain't
No, you ain't
You ain't
