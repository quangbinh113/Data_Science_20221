Song Name: Restless Spirits
For reasons that don't matter, I was walking down the alley
When I heard this music coming through the screen
Without really thinking, I walked up to the window
To a scene that felt just like a dream
She was standing in the kitchen, her face turned towards the ceiling
Her eyes were closed, but still they held the light
And from a battered guitar came a sound like angels weeping
For all those restless spirits in the night
I don't know how long I stood there, but it felt like many lifetimes
Before I felt her love float away
Walking back down the alley, feeling so much better
I knew that I could take another day
Cause she was standing in the kitchen,
Her face turned towards the ceiling
Her eyes were closed, but still they held the light
And from a battered guitar came a sound like angels weeping
For all those restless spirits in the night
And from a battered guitar came a sound like angels weeping
For all those restless spirits in the night
