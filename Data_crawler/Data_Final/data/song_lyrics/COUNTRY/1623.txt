Song Name: Diggin' Up Bones
Last night I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn
Yeah I've been sittin' alone diggin' up bones
Then I went through the jewelery and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that are better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
I'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
I'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
