Song Name: Best Shot
I'm just flesh and bone
Heart and soul, and I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kinda thing
Slide right outta my arms
I struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now
'Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down
On a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you
I'm not the man I was before, yeah
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect
Oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
You saw a spark inside of me
That no one else could find
Your "good morning" eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind
'Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down
On a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you
I'm not the man I was before, yeah
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect, oh
'Cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
When I saw you for the first time
I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singin' every time I hear your name
When you smile I see the sun sink down
On a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you
I'm not the man I was before, yeah
When you smile I see the sun sink down
On a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you
I'm better than I was before, yeah
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect, oh
God knows I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give you
I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah
Woah, woah, yeah
Oh, yeah
