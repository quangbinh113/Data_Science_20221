Song Name: What Kinda Gone
I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things.
Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here
Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about
Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here
Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back
Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout
Yes what kinda gone are we talkin bout here
What kinda gone
