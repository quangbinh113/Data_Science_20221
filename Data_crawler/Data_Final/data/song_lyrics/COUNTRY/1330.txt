Song Name: Over Now
Last night might as well have been an all-out war
Girl, I don't wanna fight like that no more
Let's clean the slate, instead of drag this out
I'm sorry, babe, let's just start over now
I don't give a damn who's wrong or right
Nothing hurts me more than to see you cry
Let's put it all in the past, it ain't worth fightin' about
Instead of lookin' back, let's just start over now
It is what it is, and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me sayin' let's get back to us
This is lovin' you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now
I still ain't changed my mind on meant to be
If time alone is what it takes to bring you back to me
Give me one more kiss before the sun goes down
Let's get it over with, let's just start over now
It is what it is, and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me sayin' let's get back to us
This is lovin' you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now
First kiss, gettin' high, how it felt to fall
Lightin' up your eyes, hearin' you smile when I call
If lettin' you go will bring you back around
Instead of later down the road
Let's just start over now, yeah
Let's just start over now
Yeah, it is what it is, and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me sayin' let's get back to us
This is lovin' you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now
Let's just start over now
(Let's start over now) let's just start over now
(Let's start over now) let's just start over now
