Song Name: If I Lived Here
I don't know if it's been said
But home is where you lay your head
When you wake up, it's where you wanna be
Now I have to go at closin' time
To a house that doesn't feel like mine
But I know one place where I'd be more at ease
If I lived here, I'd be home by now
Every hour would be happy
With all my friends around
It'd be last call whenever I fall down
If I lived here, I'd be home by now
Quarter don't buy much these days
But 'round here, it still gets three plays
On that old bubbler jukebox in the corner
Christmas lights will hide the dust
On antler chandeliers and such
I wonder what it looks like in the morning
Just think of what I'd save on cabs
I'd never have to close my tab
They couldn't lock the door and make me leave
If I lived here, I'd be home by now
Every hour would be happy
With all my friends around
It'd be last call whenever I fall down
If I lived here, I'd be home by now
(Yeah, whew, no)
Yeah, I can raise hell
And nobody cares
You don't have to go home
When you're already there
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
From my living room, I could paint this town
With the money I'd save, I could buy us all a round
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
(Yeah, whew)
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
From my living room, I could paint this town
With the money I'd save, I could buy us all a round
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
(That's good, whew)
(Uh-uh, whew)
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
From my living room, I could paint this town
With the money I'd save, I could buy us all a round
Yeah, if I lived here, I'd be home by now
(Yeah, whew)
Come on to my house
You don't ever have to leave
But please pay your tab and tip your bartender
