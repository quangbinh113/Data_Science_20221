Song Name: Two Story House
Older doesn't always make you taller
And those pictures on mama's fridge prove that
And if that room we shared up the stairs was any smaller
Our eyes would've been a little less brown and a little more black
But we both looked out the same windows
Wished on the same stars
Hung our blue jeans in the same breeze, in the same backyard
And how can two kids with the same raising
Wind up on such different pages
We all got our different callings
Yeah, I guess that's why they call it
A two-story house
A two-story house
Her dream was diamond rings and having babies
And mine was guitar strings and a pot of gold
And to this day, she calls me up and calls me crazy
And I just kinda laugh and say, "I know"
She can never leave
And I can never go back
Kinda like a stray dog and a calico cat
Who both looked out the same windows
Wished on the same stars
Hung our blue jeans in the same breeze, in the same backyard
And how can two kids with the same raising
Wind up on such different pages
We all got our different callings
Yeah, I guess that's why they call it
A two-story house
A two-story house
And how can two kids with the same raising
Wind up on such different pages
We all got our different callings
Yeah, I guess that's why they call it
A two-story house
A two-story house
