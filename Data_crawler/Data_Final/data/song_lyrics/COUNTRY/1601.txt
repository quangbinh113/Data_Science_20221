Song Name: Bluebird Wine - 2003 Remaster
Baby brought me in out off the highway
Made me put my money in the bank, bank
Straightened out my crooked way of thinking
Made it purely pleasure when I drank
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on bluebird wine
Now baby taught me a different way of thinkin'
Like how to spend my evenings here at home
Listening to the music on the radio
Drinking all the bluebird we can hold
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on bluebird wine
Well baby says he'd really love a party
We'll get some friends together feelin' fine
Any friend of mine is worth his habit
A belly full of baby's bluebird wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Party just started
Lord I'm drunk on bluebird wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on bluebird wine
