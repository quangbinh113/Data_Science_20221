Song Name: I Don't Wanna Go To Heaven - Choir Version
It's that tin roof rain on a Sunday morning
It's your grandma's cross around your neck
It's that sunrise glowing through the blinds in the window
The kind that always steal my breath
Why would I ever wanna leave?
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
I count every kiss and every blessing
As the only proof I'll ever need
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
It's like that old dirt road was paved in gold
The pearly gates are our front porch
Loving you makes me believe
Even if the good Lord don't let me in, I got a glimpse
Of what it could've been, so
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
I count every kiss and every blessing
As the only proof I'll ever need
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
Lying next to me
And I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
I count every kiss and every blessing
The only proof I'll ever need, yeah
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here next to me
I count every kiss and every blessing
As the only proof I'll ever need
I don't wanna go to Heaven
When Heaven's right here lying next to me
Lying next to me
