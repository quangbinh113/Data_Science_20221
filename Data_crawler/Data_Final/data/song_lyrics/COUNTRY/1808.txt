Song Name: Craving You
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm countin' down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go
I never had somethin' that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's somethin' 'bout you girl I just can't fight
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you
Cravin' you
All the in-between is killin' me
You know I come unglued from missin' you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do
I never had somethin' that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's somethin' 'bout you I just can't fight
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you
Cravin' you
(I'm always cravin' you)
Cravin' you
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm countin' down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go
(Yeah, yeah)
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you, yeah
Cravin' you
Cravin' you
(I'm cravin' you baby)
I'm cravin' you
I'm cravin' you babe
