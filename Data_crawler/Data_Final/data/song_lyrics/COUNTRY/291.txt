Song Name: Pontoon
Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a koozie
Let's go
Who said anything about skiin'?
Floatin' is all I wanna do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbecue
On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmm... motorboatin'
(Woo-woo-woo)
Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black intertube
Pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmm... motorboatin'

(Woo-woo-woo)
(Woo-woo-woo)
Five mile an hour with aluminum sides
Wood panelin' with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride
On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
I'm out here in the open
Mmm... motorboatin'
On the pontoon
(Woo-woo-woo)
On the pontoon
(Woo-woo-woo)
Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon
(Woo-woo-woo)

(Woo-woo-woo)
