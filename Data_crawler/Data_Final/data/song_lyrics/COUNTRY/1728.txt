Song Name: Midnight Train To Memphis
Oh!
Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, then for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis
