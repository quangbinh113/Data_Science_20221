Song Name: Life's a Dance
When I was fourteen I was fallin' fast
For a blue eyed girl in my homeroom class
Tryin' to find the courage to ask her out
Was like tryin' to get oil from a waterspout
What she would have said I can't say
I never did ask and she moved away
But I learned somethin' from my blue eyed girl
Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go
The longer I live the more I believe
You do have to give if you wanna receive
There's a time to listen, a time to talk
And you might have to crawl even after you walk
Had sure things blow up in my face
Seen the long shot, win the race
Been knocked down by the slammin' door
Picked myself up and came back for more
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go
Life's a dance, life's a dance
Life's a dance, take a chance on love
Life's a dance, you learn as you go
