Song Name: Just Drive
We're almost halfway to that five-star reservation downtown
I'm praying that you're thinking what I'm about to say right now
I hate to go and wreak all your plans
But if I'm being honest, I'd rather spend it
Right here, we can be alone
You and me, this white Toyota
Paramore on the radio
Going 90, down 40
'Til there ain't no road these wheels don't know
Your hand on mine over the console
Don't gotta go anywhere tonight
Oh, we can just drive
Oh, we can just drive
Trade-in that rooftop for a sunroof
Underneath the moon
'Cause sitting across some table would be too far from you
If we ever get there, it will be too soon
So miss a turn or two
Whatever you gotta do to stay
Right here, we can be alone
You and me, this white Toyota
Paramore on the radio
Going 90, down 40
'Til there ain't no road these wheels don't know
Your hand on mine over the console
Don't gotta go anywhere tonight
Oh, we can just drive
Oh, we can just drive
Oh, we could just-
Oh, we could just drive
I hate to go and wreak all your plans
But if I'm being honest, I'd rather spend it
Right here we can be alone
You and me, this white Toyota
Paramore on the radio
Going 90, down 40
'Til there ain't no road these wheels don't know
Your hand on mine over the console
Don't gotta go anywhere tonight
Oh, we can just drive (just you and me, just you and me)
Just drive (oh, I wanna know any road)
Just you and me
Just you and me, boy
Oh, I wanna know any road
