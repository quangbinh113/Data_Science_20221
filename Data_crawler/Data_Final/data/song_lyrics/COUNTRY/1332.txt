Song Name: What If I Don't
Why am I still buying make-up that's waterproof?
Everybody goes through break-ups, I know they do
But not with you
Yeah
I thought that thinking 'bout you every day
That getting drunk and calling you so late
I know this wanting you is just a phase
And with a little time I'd be okay
What if I'm not strong as I think?
What if in two years I still can't sleep
What if I meet somebody new
And every kiss feels like I'm cheating on you
What if we made a big mistake?
What if my heart never unbreaks?
People move on, people let go
What if you do?
What if I don't?
What if whiskey makes me miss you forever?
What if I go out and see you doing better than ever?
Yeah
I thought that thinking 'bout you every day
That getting drunk and calling you so late
I know this wanting you is just a phase
Maybe for you it is, but for me it ain't
What if I'm not strong as I think?
What if in two years I still can't sleep
What if I meet somebody new
And every kiss feels like I'm cheating on you
What if we made a big mistake?
What if my heart never unbreaks?
People move on, people let go
What if you do?
What if I don't?
Ever stop loving you
Ever stop needing you
What if I, what if I don't?
Ever stop going through
Hell that I'm going through?
Oh
Oh what if I, what if I don't?
No
What if I'm not strong as I think?
What if in two years I still can't sleep
What if I meet somebody new
And every kiss feels like I'm cheating on you
What if we made a big mistake?
What if my heart never unbreaks?
People move on, people let go
What if you do?
I wanna move on, wanna let go
What if you do?
What if I don't?
Mmhmm, what if I don't?
