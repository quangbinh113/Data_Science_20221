Song Name: I Love the Way You Love Me
I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there
And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane
But I love the way you love me

Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me
I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
While you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times
But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason
I could never live without you
I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me
Oh baby
I love the way you love me
