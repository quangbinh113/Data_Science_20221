Song Name: Eighteen Wheels And A Dozen Roses
Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of drivin'
Up and down the interstate
But Charlie's had a good life
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer
Be countin' the days
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
And he'll spend the rest if his life
With the one that he loves
They'll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
Do a lotta catchin' up
A little at a time
With pieces of the old dream
They're gonna light the old flame
Doin' what they please
Leavin every other reason behind
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
And he'll spend the rest if his life
With the one that he loves
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
And he'll spend the rest if his life
With the one that he loves
