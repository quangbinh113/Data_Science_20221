Song Name: Love You Like That
Hey girl, I'm just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that
When I'm with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we're travelin' on girl
And I'm bettin' that it's gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I'm gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin'
So baby let's take it, take it
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that
I ain't gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I'm a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy ya
So let me love you
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track girl
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that
Baby, I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that
Yaa aaaa
I ain't gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I'm a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
