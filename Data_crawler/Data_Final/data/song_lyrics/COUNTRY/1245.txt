Song Name: Second One To Know
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
