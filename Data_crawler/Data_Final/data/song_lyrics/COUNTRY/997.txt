Song Name: Without A Word
Trying to back off
Trying to lay low
Giving you time to read the stars
Trying to wait for something you don't know
To show you where you are
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are
It's been so long now
I know I should forget you
I'm bound to wonder
All about you
No matter how I try
There you are
There you are
There you are
