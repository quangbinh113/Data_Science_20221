Song Name: Moonstar
You're hiding in the backroom, dancing's on the rise
Feel the cold wind blow, and it's coming from all sides
Barefoot in the back streets, shadows on the floor
Take out Little Annie 'cause she's heading out the door
Everybody knows only you can stop her now
Maybe that's 'cause you know how
Moonstar
You're my moonstar
In the sky
Looking down on me
You're my moonstar
That's what you are
Taking me up Old Street, ya checkin' out the view
Taking me all over, yeah, you know what to do
Taking out the unknown, yeah, take it from me
So take it off the internet, yeah, take it all for free
Fakin' it all night, now Ðµveryone's said their peace
It's time to all fall to your knees
Moonstar
You're my moonstar
In the sky
Looking down on me
You're my moonstar
That's what you are

Moonstar
You're my moonstar
In the sky
Looking down on me
You're my moonstar
That's what you are
Moonstar
You're my moonstar
In the sky
Looking down on me
You're my moonstar
That's what you are
