Song Name: As You Leave (undone)
Staring at you in my T-shirt
Don't know how you look so good in the AM
Grab your phone and call in to work
You know, you could just stay all day in my bed
If you gotta go, you gotta go
But if you gotta go, you gotta know
As soon as you leave
Yeah, the clock stops ticking
And you take the sun with you
And the world quits spinning
Every second feels like
Waiting on the green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissing
And I'm wishing there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hitting me
As soon as you leave
Girl, I know you're probably thinking
I need some time, a night out with the boys
Let me share a little secret, all I need is
More of you, I'd be cool if you never left
As soon as you leave
Yeah, the clock stops ticking
And you take the sun with you
And the world quits spinning
Every second feels like
Waiting on the green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissing
And I'm wishing there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hitting me
As soon as you leave
Oh, as soon as you leave, yeah
As soon as you leave
Yeah, the clock stops ticking
And you take the sun with you
And the world quits spinning
Every second feels like
Waiting on the green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissing
And I'm wishing there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hitting me
As soon as you leave
Oh, as soon as you leave
(As soon as you leave)
