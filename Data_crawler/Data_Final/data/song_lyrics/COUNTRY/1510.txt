Song Name: When You're Coming Down
Tell me sweet mama, do you really love me
Or is it just another young love, bubble gum crush gettin' cold feet
I heard your daddy hates cowboys, he'd rather had a roughneck
Save a little change till the oil goes away but I ain't that way
No I'm gonna ride my pony til the cows come home
I'm gonna sing my song on the radio
I'm gonna dance to the beat of my own
But I know you're way up high
So when you're coming down let me know
They say I dress a little funny, cause I don't really wear boots
I only wear em when I'm workin' and my feet are always hurtin' plus
I know you like my tennis shoes
I wear my hair a little longer, I know you like me clean shaved
But if you love me cause I'm punchy then you're gonna have to love me
When I get a little rowdy on a weekday
I'm gonna ride my pony til the cows come home
I'm gonna sing my song on the radio
I'm gonna dance to the beat of my own
But I know you're way up high
So when you're coming down let me know
Yeah won't you let me know
I'm gonna ride my pony til the cows come home
I'm gonna sing my song on the radio
I'm gonna dance to the beat of my own
But I know you're way up high
So when you're coming down let me know
Uh, won't you let me know
