Song Name: When's It Gonna Happen
Never been good at expectations
I think i expect too much
But if it's any consolation
I still believe in love
You know i got your invitation
Can't wait for Rosemary Beach
Guess i should tell you he's not coming
There's no plus one, it's just me
And i'll show up in a dress with a smile
And i couldn't be happier for you
Sometimes i feel like i'm the last one standin'
I look around and all my friends are fallin' in love
I'm scared to death i'll end up empty handed
Can't be the only one
Thinking when's it gonna happen, happen to me
Know it's supposed to happen naturally
When's it gonna happen to me?
Mmm, yeah yeah yeah
I've been lookin' in the mirror
Oh, i've been workin' on myself
Got a big ol' room in a little house
That i can't wait to share with someone else
Sometimes i feel like i'm the last one standin'
I look around and all my friends are fallin' in love
I'm scared to death i'll end up empty handed
Can't be the only one
Thinking when's it gonna happen, happen to me
Know it's supposed to happen naturally
When's it gonna happen to me?
Will it happen on a tuesday afternoon?
When i'm sittin' at a cafe down the street
Will you say "hello" and i know it's you?
And you say "hello" and you know it's me?
Oh, when's it gonna happen, happen to me?
Know it's supposed to happen naturally
When's it gonna happen?
Oh, to me
Ah, yeah yeah, yeah
