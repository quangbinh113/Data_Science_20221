Song Name: Draw From My Memory
I draw from my memory
I draw from the times that time could have forgot
Tell you I'm angry
Like things ain't even stressful enough
Time may put, another love in your arms
Know this darlin, the only one that i got
I wish for my memory
I pray that it's only days with you
It's hard to keep leaving
Just know i sing all these songs for you
Time will take, one of us too soon you know
Know this babe, I'll always love you so
Catch if you've fallen
Hold out my arms in case you decide
I come to you calling
When sick i promise to be by your side
Time to us, is a fleeting friend
She lies to us, this too shall end
Won't let go, I won't bat an eye
Forever my love, or just through the night
