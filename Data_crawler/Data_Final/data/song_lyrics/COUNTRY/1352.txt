Song Name: Face In The Crowd
Well, this ol' guitar in the spotlight
Girl, if people only knew
Said it's the same guitar I wrote a thousand songs on
Nobody heard but you
Baby, you were singin' it first
'Fore anybody ever noticed
Now everybody knows every single word
Think it's time I wrote this
And when my fifteen minutes ends
And the world loves me a little less
I hope you know that you're the only one
I was trying to impress
If I sold out Bryant-Denny
Make my sweet home so proud
All I ever cared about, all I ev–µr cared about
Was your face in the crowd
I love hearing me singing on that radio
'Cause 'at means we gonna get paid
But a hundred of his songs ain't got nothin' on
Them babies we made
Yeah, this dream come true is a dream come true
It's a crazy ride we're on (it's a crazy ride we're on)
I know as fast as famous came
Fame is gonna be gone
So when my fifteen minutes ends
And the world loves me a little less (and the world loves me)
I hope you know that you're the only one
I was trying to impress (I was trying to impress)
If I sold out Bryant-Denny's
Make my sweet home so proud
All I ever cared about, all I ever cared about
Was your face in the crowd
Your face in the crowd
Smiling at me
Even though you know the mess
Behind these six strings
So when my fifteen minutes ends
And the world loves me a little less
I hope you know that you're the only one
I was trying to impress (I was trying to impress)
If I sold out Bryant-Denny's
Make my sweet home so proud
All I ever cared about, all I ever cared about
Was your face in the crowd
Said all I ever cared about, all I ever cared about
Was your face in the crowd
