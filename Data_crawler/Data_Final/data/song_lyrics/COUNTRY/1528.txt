Song Name: Blue Yodel (T for Texas)
'T' for Texas, 'T' for Tennessee
'T' for Texas, 'T' for Tennessee
'T' for Thelma,
That girl that made a wreck out of me
Yodelaeeeo...
If you don't want me, Mama
You sure don't have to stall, Lawd, Lawd
If you don't want me, Mama
You sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women
Than a passenger train can haul
Yodelaeeeo...
I'm gonna buy me a pistol
Just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna buy me a pistol, Lawd, Lawd
Just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Thelma
Just to see her jump and fall
Yodelaeeeo...
I'm going where the water drinks like cherry wine
I'm going where the water drinks like cherry wine
'Cause the Georgia water tastes like terpentine
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a big long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a big long shiny barrel
I'm gonna that round dog that stole away my gal
Yodelaeeeo...
Rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Rather drink muddy water a sleep in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like a dirty dog
Yodelaeeeo...
