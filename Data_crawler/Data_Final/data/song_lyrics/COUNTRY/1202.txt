Song Name: Buy A Girl A Drink
If you wanna watch money disappear, go buy a boat
If you wanna see it double in a couple years, buy some land
If you're gonna bet it all, all I can say is football ain't the way to go
If you really wanna spend the best 7.50 you can
Buy a girl a drink, talk to her all night
Call her three days later, kiss her in the porch light
Go meet her mom and dad Labor Day weekend
Catch hell from your buddies 'cause you're in the deep end
Buy a ring, get married, honeymoon on an island
Raise babies and look back smiling from a rocking chair
Then I swear you'll be there fast as you can blink
Just buy a girl a drink
If you gotta get yourself one first, buddy that's okay
Make it something strong and get that courage up
Go say something to her that you thought was smooth
That she'll laugh about one day
And drink it all up 'cause it goes by quicker than the liquor down in that cup
Buy a girl a drink, talk to her all night
Call her three days later, kiss her in the porch light
Go meet her mom and dad Labor day weekend
Catch hell from your buddies 'cause you're in the deep end
Buy a ring, get married, honeymoon on an island
Raise babies and look back smiling from a rocking chair
Then I swear you'll be there fast as you can blink
Just buy a girl a drink
(Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)
Yeah, buy a girl a drink and hold on tight
'Cause that's all that you can do
'Cause if she's the one, I'm telling you, man
You can't afford not to
Buy a girl a drink, talk to her all night
Call her three days later, kiss her in the porch light
Go meet her mom and dad Labor day weekend
Catch hell from your buddies 'cause you're in the deep end
Buy a ring, get married, honeymoon on an island
Raise babies and look back smiling from a rocking chair
Then I swear you'll be there fast as you can blink
Just buy a girl a drink
