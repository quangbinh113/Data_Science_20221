Song Name: Cowboy
Stepping on your toes
Thinking that they know a bit of everything
Cussin' at their moms
Never mowed the lawn
Or anything
Sick of pickup lines, I could use a pickup truck
All these city boys never seem to have enough
I want a good man, steady and stable
Won't wear his hat at the dinner table
2 step on a wrap around porch on a Friday night
He's gonna love me sun up sun down
Wild as the west when the lights go out
And those Levi blue eyes leave me no choice
I need a cowboy
They look cute in their suits
Living life in the fast lane
Bet they can't bait a hook
Bet they've never even prayed for rain
I'm sick of mini skirts, I could use the outskirts right now
'Cause what I need I ain't gonna find downtown
Yeah, I want a good man, steady and stable
Who don't wear his hat at the dinner table
2 step on a wrap around porch on a Friday night
He's gonna love me sun up sun down
Wild as the west when the lights go out
And those Levi blue eyes leave me no choice
I need a cowboy
I want a good man, steady and stable
Won't wear his hat at the dinner table
2 step on a wrap around porch on a Friday night
He's gonna love me sun up sun down
Wild as the west when the lights go out
And those Levi blue eyes leave me no choice
Yeah, those Levi blue eyes leave me no choice
I need a cowboy
