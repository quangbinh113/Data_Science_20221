Song Name: The Christmas Song
Ohh ooh hoohhh oohhh ohoh oho
I saw you at the mall
Shopping for attention
I saw you with a truck
Still buying packs full of love
I saw you a light
Think for something I can mention
Did you see me
I have these things free
You don't need to worry
To shop for some presents
I don't need to worry
Ooh ask for your love
Could it be that we are meant to be for each other
Did you ever wonder
If Santa sees us
I know that you wanna share
For Christmas
Oehh
But you don't ever need to buy me sweet things
I don't need it
I have it
You gave me the greatest gift
No presents could ever compete
Cuz you are my Christmas girl
Cuz you gave me the brightest Christmas time
Ooh oohohoowo oohhw
Now you know that I I don't need the extra's
It's you to buy or into pay for your love
I don't need my credit card to satisfy my girl cuz
It's love material stuff that she's dreaming of
You know that I have to shop for Christmas
And I just don't know where to stop
No screw jif, ooh it's huge if
I got it
You gave me the greatest gift
No presents could ever compete
Cuz you are my Christmas girl
Cuz you are the brightest
You gave me the greatest gift
Of some that I only could dream of
Cuz you are my Christmas girl
Yeah
Cuz you gave me the brightest Christmas time
Owoho ohoo oo oowow
Owoho ohoo oo oowow
If you could see witch presents I can give
You wouldn't go shopping anymore
If you know just what I got in store
You wouldn't have to lend no more
Yeah
You gave me the greatest gift
No present could ever compete
You are my Christmas girl
Yeah yeah
You gave me the greatest gift
No presents could ever compete
Cuz you are my Christmas girl
Cuz you are the brightest
Yeah
You gave me the greatest gift
Of some that I only could dream of
Cuz you are my Christmas girl
Yeah
Cuz you gave me the brightest Christmas time
If you wanna feel me with Christmas
If you wanna feel me with Christmas
Yeah Yeah
Give me your hart
Cuz you gave me the greatest Christmas time
