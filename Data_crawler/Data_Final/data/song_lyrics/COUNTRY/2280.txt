Song Name: Train
Baby leave wherever you are
Cut a path through the midnight dark
Hope ya wearing those jeans and that black leather jacket
And those high heels that make a whole lot of racket
Crash through the door, perfume like smoke
Straight up the stairs to the room you know
Don't slow down when you hit the sheets
Bring that touch on in full speed
'Cause you got that reckless that I need
Come on girl, make a wreck of me
I want you love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Come in hot baby kiss me fast
I don't care about the aftermath
I want your love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Said you were close about an hour ago
I'm waiting here in the TV glow
You know you got me going out of my mind
Thinking 'bout us and the last time
'Cause you got that reckless that I need
Come on girl make a wreck of me
I want your love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Come in hot baby kiss me fast
I don't care about the aftermath
I want your love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Roll down the track never look back, level me
Little smile little laugh the way you level me
You level me
'Cause you got that wreck less that I need
Come on girl make a wreck of me
I want your love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Come in hot baby kiss me fast
I don't care about the aftermath
I want your love to hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
Hit me like a train
