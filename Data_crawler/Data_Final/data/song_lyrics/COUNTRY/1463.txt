Song Name: He Ain't a Cowboy
He found that buckle in a pawn shop
Can't two-step across this floor
Them boots ain't ever seen the mud
Can't be what you're looking for
He's got a half-assed smile and fake southern drawl
He's dressed up like the Marlboro man
He's never backed in a box or dropped in a chute
And he's never rode for a brand
'Cause he ain't a cowboy, he ain't a plowboy
He's just a city boy in disguise
And he's never drove a tractor, maybe that's the kind of man you're after
And he can't saddle up no horse, so, he ain't ever gonna ride away
And I'm a saddle sore puncher in a buckle I won
I'm sure to break your heart one day
He's never pulled no plow from dusk 'til dawn or thrown hay 'til the sun came up
He's never hooked no bass on a Texas rig, hell, the man don't drive a truck
And he'll be out across town tomorrow night, skinny jeans 'cause he has no shame
He's never tipped his hat for guts or glory while riding through the pain
'Cause he ain't a cowboy, he ain't a plowboy
He's just a city boy in disguise
And he's never drove a tractor, maybe that's the kind of man you're after
And he can't saddle up no horse, so, he ain't ever gonna ride away
And I'm a saddle sore puncher in a buckle I won
I'm sure to break your heart one day
He's sellin' you a lie, girl, here's a lesson you will learn
Those boots don't make a cowboy, baby, it's a title that you earn
So if you leave with me tonight, know that it's hell I'll put you through
But we'll be rolling down south with them speakers cranked up
Listening to Chris LeDoux
He ain't a cowboy, he ain't a plowboy
He's just a city boy in disguise
And he's never drove a tractor, maybe that's the kind of man you're after
And he can't saddle up no horse, so, he ain't ever gonna ride away
And I'm a saddle sore puncher in a buckle I won
I'm sure to break your heart one day
Yeah, I'm a saddle sore puncher in a buckle I won
I'm sure to break your heart one day
