Song Name: Timber I'm Falling In Love
The right time, the right place, the right body, the right face
Timber, I'm falling in love
It started slow, it's coming fast, I got a feeling it's gonna last
Timber, I'm falling in love
You're so pretty, you look so sweet, your love's sweepin' me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin' of, I can't believe that I'm falling in love
Who knows how love starts, I woke up with you in my heart
Timber, I'm falling in love
You're so pretty, you look so sweet, your love's sweepin' me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin' of, I can't believe that I'm falling in love
Who knows how love starts, I woke up with you in my heart
Timber, I'm falling in love
Timber, I'm falling in love, timber, I'm falling in love
