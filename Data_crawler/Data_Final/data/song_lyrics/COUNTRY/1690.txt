Song Name: Married Alone (feat. Vince Gill)
Together apart
Married alone
It's hell on the heart lying in the dark
Trying not to let you hear my tears
Fall through the phone
This house is where we live
But without you here
Honey, it ain't a home
There may be rings on our fingers
But we're married alone
Kiss me goodbye
For worse or for better
Four days and three nights
Might as well be forever
Don't say you miss me
It hurts more that helps
Mr. and Mrs. all by ourselves
This half single life
Is like an old pair of shoes
They just don't fit quite
Like they used to
Lonely's a friend
We both know too well
But still we're all in
On the hand we've been dealt
Together apart
Married alone
It's hell on the heart lying in the dark
Trying not to let you hear my tears
Fall through the phone
This house is where we live
But without you here
Honey, it ain't a home
There may be rings on our fingers
But we're married alone
We're supposed to pick up
Right where we left
Put us back together
Before the next
Time to get going
One more kiss goodbye
'Til death do us part
Another part of me dies
Together apart
Married alone
It's hell on the heart lying in the dark
Trying not to let you hear my tears
Fall through the phone
This house is where we live
But without you here
Honey, it ain't a home
There may be rings on our fingers
But we're married alone
No, I don't wanna be strangers
Married alone
