Song Name: Love You To Death
I know you're troubled about
Changes that are weighing you down
When life just ain't fair
It's okay to be scared
Nobody's that figured out
And I know a place we can hide
Paint our own world full of life
Ride off in the sunset
Get lost in the moment
Even if it's just tonight
Baby, sink in this bed
Stare with me at the ceiling
Let's lay here catching our breath
And if we slip away
While we're high on the feeling
I promise we won't have regrets
If you just let me love you to death

Just 'cause I ain't one for crowds
Don't mean you don't make me proud
And I'm a hard pill to take
And I'm the first one to say
Ain't got it all figured out
Baby, sink in this bed
Stare with me at the ceiling
Let's lay here catching our breath
And if we slip away
While we're high on the feeling
I promise we won't have regrets
If you just let me love you to death
Baby, sink in this bed
Stare with me at the ceiling
Let's lay here catching our breath
Oh, if we slip away
While we're high on the feeling
I promise we won't have regrets
If you just let me love you
Just let me love you
Baby, just let me love you to death
