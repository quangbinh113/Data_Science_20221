Song Name: The One
Baby, don't take this wrong
But loving you's the worst
'Cause I'm so goddamn happy that it hurts (hmm)
I wish I could calm down
I know I should but we feel so good I'm scared
Get to think 'bout forever without you there
And I swear
If you ain't the one, I'm done, yeah
I'm talking, maybe die alone
The one that I remember being young with when I'm old
Even if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
That made me, that changed me
You're the only truth I ever felt
And I know that even if I marry someone else
Baby, if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
That I'll think of
If our dream comes true and I make it to Japan
It won't mean nothing if it ain't your hand (say yes, say yes)
In my hand (say yes)
If you ain't the one, I'm done, yeah
I'm talking, maybe die alone
The one that I remember being young with when I'm old
Even if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
That made me, that changed me
You're the only truth I ever felt
And I know that even if I marry someone else
Baby, if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
Life last so long and most love it don't last
I could never forget you laughing like that
It would haunt me forever
If you ain't the one, I'm done, yeah
I'm talking, maybe die alone
The one that I remember being young with when I'm old
Even if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
That made me, that changed me
You're the only truth I ever felt
And I know that even if I marry someone else
Baby, if you ain't the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
Still be the one
Yeah, you'll still be the one
