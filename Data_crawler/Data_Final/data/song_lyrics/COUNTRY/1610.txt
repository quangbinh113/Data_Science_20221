Song Name: He Stopped Loving Her Today
He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still prayed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all

Hopin' she'd come back again
Kept some letters by his bed

Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single "I love you"
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
Ya know she came to see him one last time
Oh and we alll wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
