Song Name: Blame It On The Double (feat. Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman & Jason Hook)
I tried to bow my head
Put down the bottle like my grandma said, my daddy did
I love her like a Waylon song
But old number seven was a damn too strong
Back road, the radio loud
Pushin' 85 and burnin' one down
Twist the cap off and pass it around
Feelin' all right now
One thing that I do well is raise some hell
Full moon on a Saturday night
Throwin' down whiskey 'til light
I swear I ain't lookin' for trouble
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
Before the drinks hit the floor
We're bustin' out the front door
Black Label's gonna bring out the rebel
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
(Yeah, blame it on the double)
15 before last call
I'm shootin' back Jack, she's puttin' out a fireball
Her boots on, nearly six feet tall
I wanna love her like a butterfly just like the Dolly song
Right girl on the wrong side of town
Drunk ex-boyfriend runnin' his mouth
Hold my drink, it's about to go down
Feelin' all right now
One thing I know too well is raisin' hell (yeah)
Full moon on a Saturday night
Throwin' down whiskey 'til light
Well, I swear I ain't lookin' for trouble
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
Before the drinks hit the floor
We're bustin' out the front door
Black Label's gonna bring out the rebel
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
(Yeah, blame it on the double)
Full moon on a Saturday night
Throwin' down whiskey 'til light
I swear I ain't lookin' for trouble
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
Before the drinks hit the floor
We're bustin' out the front door
Black Label's gonna bring out the rebel
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear I ain't lookin' for trouble
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Black Label's gonna bring out the rebel
Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double
(Yeah, blame it on the double)
