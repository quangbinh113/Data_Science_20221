Song Name: Lone Wolf
The only pack I ever ran with were the cigarettes in my pocket
My only friend was the sun and the wind to my back on the road I was walkin'
Nowhere to go, no one to know when I got there
Til' I met you, I had nothing to lose and if I did, I didn't care
Now this lone wolf is done runnin' down the moon
In the daylight dark of the night this heart is howlin' for you
Yeah, this lone wolf ain't lonely anymore
'Cause you weren't afraid to reach out and save a lone wolf at your door
Inside I still gotta wild side with a taste for good and gone
Yeah, your love likes all my inside out and leaves my porch light on
You sprung my cage, red lined my gauge and fueled a fire
Yeah, your hand in mine makes my heart soar like a Hallelujah choir (Hallelujah)
Yeah, this lone wolf is done runnin' down the moon
In the daylight dark of the night this heart is howlin' for you
Yeah, this lone wolf ain't lonely anymore
'Cause you weren't afraid to reach out and save a lone wolf at your door
'Cause you weren't afraid to reach out and save the lone wolf at your door
This lone wolf
This lone wolf
This lone wolf
