Song Name: If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel, would you treat me like a devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst, would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
Now, we can talk all night about the weather
Could tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or ask what I really wanna know
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel, would you treat me like a devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst, would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
Now rain can fall so soft against the window
Sun can shine so bright up in the sky
But daddy always told me, "Don't make small talk"
He said, "Come on out, and say what's on your mind"
So if I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel, would you treat me like a devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst, would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel, would you treat me like the devil tonight?
