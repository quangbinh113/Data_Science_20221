Song Name: High Heels
(Oh-yeah, oh-yeah)
(Oh, yeah)
I wake up like a billion dollars in the morning (oh, yeah)
I pick and choose from 20 cars on Mr. Foreigns (zoom)
I'll take my whisky neat to hide my mixed emotions (my mixed emotions)
And they don't got a clue
My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (oh, yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface, but, I'm sinking underneath (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like
You know, life is priceless
There's pressure, but, I guess pressure make diamonds (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like
Giddy up, giddy up, family daddy
Almost got that grammy, but
I guess they don't do fancy like me, but I'm cool with it
I got low miles on my Prius rollin'
Down the row with Jesus (amen), and my food at Applebee's is for free
I got this light and I'm lit like flash
Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, God
I'm blessed, yeah-yeah-yeah
I do my best, I do, 'cause I got so much I could lose
And they don't got a clue (aye)
My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (oh, yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface but I'm sinking underneath (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like
Yeah, you know my life is like
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
You know my life is like a merry-go-'round
The way I go 'round and around (aye)
I hope that you know that I don't have me under control
Take me as I am
My life is like parties over sleep (woo, hey)
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams, oh, yeah
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface but I'm sinking underneath (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like
