Song Name: Sweet Symphony (with Chris Stapleton)
I get weak
Whenever you're around
I let my walls down
Lay my weapons on the floor
Fight
Every day I used to fight
And dream of real love at night
Well, it's reality now
Loving you's a sweet, sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
My heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers
Wrong
We'll get things wrong
But as long as we keep, every promise we make
We'll stay whole
I know
There'll be heavy days
But in every mistake
There's a lesson to learn, so stay here with me
Loving you's a sweet, sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
My heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers
Even in the valley, baby (oh, yeah)
When the rivers too deep
Let me be your comfort, darling
Wherever this road leads
Loving you's a sweet, sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
My heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers
