Song Name: I Wish
I wish every wish I ever made on every wishing star came true
I wish that every morning I'd open my eyes and I'd see you
I wish that I could fix a broken heart with stitches or some glue
But above all babe, I wish, I didn't have to wish the best for you
Ooooo, Ooooo
She's a lucky girl I bet your smile lights up her world
And Lord I wish she wasn't pretty
But she is
There's a part of me that doesn't want you to be happy
But that ain't something I'm happy to admit
I wish I was Cinderella
But the shoe just didn't fit
I wish every wish I ever made on every wishing star came true
I wish that every morning I'd open my eyes and I'd see you
I wish that I could fix a broken heart with stitches or some glue
But above all babe, I wish, I didn't have to wish the best for you
Ooooo, Ooooo
Saw you standing there wishing I didn't care
But I stared as you looked at her like you never looked at me
It's a bitter pill I have to swallow
But I hope someday the aftertaste you left me will be sweet
Even when I feel the four leaf clovers
You're the only one I see
I wish every wish I ever made on every wishing star came true
I wish that every morning I'd open my eyes and I'd see you
I wish that I could fix a broken heart with stitches or some glue
But above all babe, I wish, I didn't have to wish the best for you
Ooooo, Ooooo
Ooooo, Ooooo
I wish every rainbow had a pot of gold just waitin' at the end
I wish you meant it when you told me that we'd never not be friends
I wish that time was something I could turn back when I wanted to
But above all, babe, you know
That I will always wish the best
For you
