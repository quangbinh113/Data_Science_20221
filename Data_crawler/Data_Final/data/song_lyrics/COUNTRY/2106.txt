Song Name: It Must Be Love
First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
It must be love
It must be love,oh,it must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreaming of
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
Something is wrong,alright
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'till morning light
It must be love
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love
It must be love,oh,it must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreaming of
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
It must be love
Oh,it must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreaming of
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
It must be love
Oh,it must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreaming of
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
