Song Name: XXX's And OOO's (An American Girl)
Phone rings, baby cries, TV diet, guru lies
Good morning honey
Go to work, make up, try to keep the balance up
Between love and money
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's tryin' to make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
Slow dance, second chance, mama needs romance
And a live-in maid
Fix the sink, mow the yard really isn't all that hard
If you get paid
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's tryin' to make it in her daddy's world
An American girl
An American girl
Well she's got her God, and she's got good wine
Aretha Franklin and Patsy Cline
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna to make it in her daddy's world
An American girl
An American girl
She's an American girl
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna to make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl, yeah
But she tied her hair up in ribbons and bows
Signed her letters with X's and O's
X's and O's
X's and O's
