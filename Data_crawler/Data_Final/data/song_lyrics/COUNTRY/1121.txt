Song Name: How Is She
I ain't gonna lie, when I saw you show up here tonight
I thought, "To hell with that," closed my tab
Yellow cab, take me back home
'Cause runnin' into you sure ain't what I was tryna do
No, but here we are at the bar catchin' up, how's that job goin'?
Best friends talk and I know y'all go way back
Answer's gonna hurt, but I still gotta ask
How is she likin' that life out in Colorado?
How is she wearin' red 'round all them Denver Broncos?
How is she makin' friends, makin' rent? I gotta know
How is she doin' fine? Smilin' in all her pictures
How is she gettin' drunk and not sendin' one "Damn, I miss ya"
I ain't been bouncin' back, I ain't been gettin' sleep
I ain't been gettin' over us, how is she?
Does she miss her hometown?
Does she wish she woulda turned around?
Does she ask about the folks she used to know
Used to hold on a night like this?
Is she better than she's ever been?
Heart to broken hearted
If you talk to her tomorrow, don't say you saw me like this, but
How is she likin' that life out in Colorado?
How is she wearin' red 'round all them Denver Broncos?
How is she makin' friends, makin' rent? I gotta know
How is she doin' fine? Smilin' in all her pictures
How is she gettin' drunk and not sendin' one "Damn, I miss ya"
I ain't been bouncin' back, I ain't been gettin' sleep
I ain't been gettin' over us
How is she so strong, movin' on with her life?
How is she spendin' her Friday and Saturday nights?
Is it with someone new? Do I wanna know the truth?
Oh no
How is she likin' that life out in Colorado?
How is she wearin' red 'round all them Denver Broncos?
How is she makin' friends, makin' rent? I gotta know
How is she doin' fine? Smilin' in all her pictures
How is she gettin' drunk and not sendin' one "Damn, I miss ya"
I ain't been bouncin' back, I ain't been gettin' sleep
I ain't been gettin' over us, how is she?

How is she? How is she?
