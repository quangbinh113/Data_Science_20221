Song Name: Forgiveness
I can't lie
It's hard to hear
After all we've shared
After all these years
I don't know
What I'm supposed to say
What I'm supposed to feel
Seeing you this way
I wish I held the answers
To all the questions in your mind
Wish I could say it will get better
But I can't look at you and lie
I know I've had my share of troubles
So who am I to give advice
But if you ain't felt forgiveness
Seems like now's the time
There was a time
You could've called and I would've dropped everything to break your fall
But times change, like people do
And any times we had, they've long been through
I wish I held the answers
To all the questions in your mind
Wish I could say it will get better
But I can't look at you and lie
I know I've had my share of troubles
So who am I to give advice
But if you ain't felt forgiveness
Seems like now's the time
I'll (say a prayer for you)
I'll (that's the best I can do)
I'll (smile and say goodbye)
I can't lie
It's hard to hear
After all we've shared
After all these years
