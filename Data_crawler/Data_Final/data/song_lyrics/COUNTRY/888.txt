Song Name: Thank God For Kids
If it weren't for kids have you ever thought
There wouldn't be no Santa Claus
Or look what the stork just brought
Thank God for kids.
And we'd all live in a quiet house
With-out Big Bird or Mickey Mouse
And Kool Aid on the couch
Thank God for kids.
Thank God for kids, there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why
The nearest thing to heaven is a child.
When you get down on your knees tonight
To thank the Lord for His guiding light
And pray they turn out rignt
Thank God for kids.
Daddy, how does this thing fly?
And a hundred other wheres and whys
You really don't know but you try
Thank God for kids.
When you look down in those trusting eyes
That look to you, you realize
There's a love that you can't buy
Thank God for kids...
