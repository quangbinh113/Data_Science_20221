Song Name: 'Til I Can Make It on My Own
I'll need time
To get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you from time to time
Now and then
Lord, you know I'll need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own
I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all from time to time
But they say
Oh, there'll be a brighter day
But 'til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
'Til I can make it on my own
Surely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my crying's done
No more hurtin' memories can find me
But 'til then
Lord, you know I'm gonna need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own
'Til I can make it on my own
