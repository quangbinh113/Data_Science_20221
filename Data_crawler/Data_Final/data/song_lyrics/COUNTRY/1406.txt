Song Name: Dooley's Farm (feat. Billy Strings)
Old Dooley was raised Carolina
Got his schoolin' out in Vietnam
Tucks his hair up in a Pioneer seed cap
When he's bringing his cash crop in
Everybody said he's just a simpleton farmer
Plow a hundred acres out in Sugar Grove
Smilin' at you from an IH tractor
But there's a secret down in every row
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Old Dooley's got a roadside farm stand
Sweet corn, tomatoes, and turnip greens
But if you ask to buy a jug of sorghum
He'll know exactly what you mean
He'll meet you in the back of the woods at midnight
Bring a lantern cause it's hard to find
He's got a strain that'll punch your lights out
Old Dooley's gonna blow your mind
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
You can hide by day but the night will find you
They caught Dooley in the moonlight
Drug him down from the field to the state farm
To bust rocks on the roadside
Now everybody says I'm just a simpleton farmer
But they don't know that I'm an outlaw
Growing green must've ran in the family
Cause old Dooley is my grandpa
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Down on Dooley's farm
