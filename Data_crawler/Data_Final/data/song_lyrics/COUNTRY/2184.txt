Song Name: Harder Stuff
The years worth of liquor, two months time
Was hard on a man my age
I couldn't see straight to the left or the right
And decided to change my ways
So, if I walk off-stage and say goodbye
Without hangin' 'round drinkin' and tellin' lies
There ain't nothing wrong
It ain't nobody's fault
I just found out and realize
Lately I've just been hangin' on
Other people, but I ain't that strong
I had my reasons for movin' on
These days liquor don't write my song
Yeah, it ain't right for a family man
To build a house on shifting sand
But don't think that I've given up
I'm just takin' on the harder stuff
And there ain't no tellin' what the neighbors think
But that never stopped me before
If I pour it all down the kitchen sink
I spilled it all over the floor
And so as so long the days gone behind closed eyes
And hello to no other heart and mind
There ain't nothing wrong
It ain't nobody's fault
I just found out and realize
Lately I've just been hangin' on
Other people, but I ain't that strong
I had my reasons for moving on
These days liquor don't write my song
Yeah, it ain't right for a family man
To build a house on shifting sand
But don't think that I've given up
I'm just takin' on the harder stuff
Don't think that I've given up
I'm just takin' on the harder stuff
