Song Name: what made you think?
I don't wanna know that you thought about me
When you heard a song at a party
I don't wanna hear about how you hear about me from everybody
How is it my fault that you took the long way home?
Don't even know why I picked up the phone
What made you think that it's okay
To call me this late and tell me you're sorry about everything?
You're still in love, I've heard it enough
I'm hangin' up, I'm so done losin' sleep
What made you think I should care, what made you think of me?
I played your little game one too many times
Guess I got sick and tired of losin'
So what's it this time? Did you see my car
See the stars and wonder what I'm doin'?
You must think I'm stupid
What made you think that it's okay
To call me this late and tell me you're sorry about everything?
You're still in love, I've heard it enough
I'm hangin' up, I'm so done losin' sleep
What made you think I should care, what made you think of me? Mmm
You're just gonna leave me
So just leave me alone
I don't even know why I picked up the phone
What made you think that it's okay
To call me this late and tell me you're sorry about everything?
You're still in love, I've heard it enough
I'm hangin' up, I'm so done losin' sleep
What made you think I should care, what made you think of me?
