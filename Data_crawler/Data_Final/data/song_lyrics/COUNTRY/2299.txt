Song Name: Hold On Loosely
You see it all around you
Good lovin' gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had
And my mind goes back to a girl I met
Some years ago who told me
Just hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
It's so damn easy
When you feel her soft touch
To overprotect her
To love her too much
And my mind goes back to a girl I met
Some years ago who told me
Just hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
Don't let her slip away
Sentimental fool
Don't let your heart get in the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You see it all around you
Good lovin' gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had
So hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
So hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Hold on loosely
But don't let go
If you cling too tightly to her
You're gonna lose control, yeah, yeah, yeah
