Song Name: We Didn't Have Much
Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes
Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo
Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole
Don't get no dirt on your church clothes
Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves
Ten percent in the offering plate
Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race
Sure'd be nice to get back to that place
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much

Eighteen, left it all behind
Chasing a girl, chasing a dime
Went so far to try to get mine
I can't see that old porch light
That led me home at night
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
When we didn't have much
I can still hear grandma reading
That red letter Book of John
I can still smell coffee in the kitchen
With old Don Williams on
And there was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
Had it all when we didn't have much
Little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
