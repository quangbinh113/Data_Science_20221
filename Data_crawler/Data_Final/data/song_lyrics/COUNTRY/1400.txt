Song Name: Excuse the Mess
Don't mind them bottles on the shelf, or the pills on the floor
Probably see all the hell through the hole in my door
The only thing in this house that ain't been to war
Is the bed, 'cause the truth is, I don't sleep anymore
Trust me, don't you worry 'bout that burnt pile sittin' out back
It's just full of all the memories from my past
And I don't wanna talk about it, so, please, don't ask
Please, don't ask
Excuse the mess, I'm a wreck (I'm a wreck)
All 'cause she got the best of my heart and my head
Left an ache in my chest
Now I ain't been the same since she left
Since she left
Oh, excuse the mess
Blood on my knuckle 'bout as red as my eyes
That cigarette's about as gone as my mind
I try to run from demons (try to run from demons)
But I can't hide
I can't hide
Excuse the mess, I'm a wreck (I'm a wreck)
All 'cause she got the best of my heart and my head
Left an ache in my chest
Now I ain't been the same since she left
Since she left
Oh, excuse the mess
Excuse the mess, I'm a wreck
All 'cause she got the best of my heart and my head
With an ache in my chest
Now I ain't been the same since she left
Since she left
Excuse the mess, I'm a wreck (I'm a wreck)
All 'cause she got the best of my heart and my head
Left an ache in my chest
Now I ain't been the same since she left
Since she left
Excuse the mess
Don't mind them bottles on the shelf, or the pills on the floor
It don't matter, 'cause she ain't comin' back anymore
