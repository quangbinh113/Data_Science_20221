Song Name: Get That All The Time
You must be from Tennessee
'Cause you're the only ten I see (damn)
Did the sun come out or did you just smile at me?
I must be, still asleep passed out in my room
'Cause you're lookin' like a dream come true (for real?)
What does it take for a girl like me
To leave this bar with a guy like you?
I bet you get that all the time (all the time)
You're probably getting pretty used to it (pretty used to it)
I bet you memorized the lines (all the lines)
I know that this ain't nothing new to ya (nothing new)
So let's skip the, "What you drinking?"
Go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it
Give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be
Better off mine
I bet you get that all the time
You're the kinda girl I wanna take home to my nana
Prettiest thing I've ever seen from L.A. to Savannah
Georgia, you're gorgeous, baby girl you're fine
I look around ain't hard to see why
I bet you get that all the time (all the time)
You're probably getting pretty used to it (getting pretty used to it)
I bet you memorized the lines (all the lines)
I know that this ain't nothing new to ya (ain't nothing new to you, baby)
So let's skip the, "What you drinking?" (ay!)
Go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it
Give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be
Better off mine
I bet you get that all the time
(All the time)
How 'bout we skip the, "What you drinking?"
Go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it
Give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be
Better off mine
I bet you get that all the time (all the time)
You're probably getting pretty used to it (probably getting pretty used to it)
I bet you memorized the lines (I bet you memorized all the lines)
I know that this ain't nothing new to ya (ain't nothing new to you, baby)
So let's skip the, "What you drinking?" (ay!)
Go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it
Give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be
Better off mine (yeah, girl)
I bet you get that all the time (yeah, yeah, girl)
All the time (oh, baby, all the time)
Now, this ain't nothing new to you
I bet you get that all the time
(I bet you get that all the time)
