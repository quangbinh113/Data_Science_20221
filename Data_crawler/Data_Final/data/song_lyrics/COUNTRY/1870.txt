Song Name: Sunday Morning Kinda Saturday Night
Well everybody 'round here is heading downtown
Drinkin' two for one cold beers in a party crowd
And all my friends are callin' me up right now
But I ain't pickin' up (pickin' up)
'Cause baby since you left I hit the deep end
Staying out 'til closing time each weekend
That ain't healin' all the hurtin' that I'm in
I gotta switch it up so I'm gettin' in the truck
'Cause I need to take in a tailgate sunset flair
I gotta talk this out with the man upstairs
'Bout where I'm goin' in this crash course life, yeah
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
Let the FM hymns blow the bench seat speakers
Let them fireflies and star lights be my preacher
Shine a little deeper than the neon light
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
Out here with the cricket's and the palm trees
And figurin' out my future ain't behind me
And fillin' up my empty cup finally
With some hundred proof of hallelujah
'Cause I need to take in a tailgate sunset flair
I gotta talk this out with the man upstairs
'Bout where I'm goin in this crash course life, yeah
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
Let the FM hymns blow the bench seat speakers
Let them fireflies and star lights be my preacher
Shine a little deeper than the neon light
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
(Sunday morning)
Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
(Sunday morning)
Sometimes you ain't gotta find a peace
You just go somewhere and let God find you, God find you
'Cause I need to take in a tailgate sunset flair
Talk this out with the man upstairs
'Bout where I'm goin' in this crash course life, yeah
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
Let the FM hymns blow the bench seat speakers
Let them fireflies and star lights be my preacher
Shine a little deeper than the neon light
I need a Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
(Sunday morning)
Sunday morning
Sunday morning kinda Saturday night
(Sunday morning)
