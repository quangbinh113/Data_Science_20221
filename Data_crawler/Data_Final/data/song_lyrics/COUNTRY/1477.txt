Song Name: Queen for a Night
If you just wanna be queen for a night
If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight
Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled
Who needs someone to hold you tight
You know I'd love to be the one you always run to
But if you only want me once in a blue moon
You can tell me, baby, it's alright
If you just wanna be queen for a night
I know we just met tonight, so I don't wanna jump the gun
But you're letting me spin you around
Like you might be the one
I don't know the book on you, but I'd like to turn every page
Or maybe we could write our own love story, but it's okay
If you just wanna be queen for a night
If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight
Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled
Who needs someone to hold you tight
You know I'd love to be the one you always run to
But if you only want me once in a blue moon
You can tell me, baby, it's alright
If you just wanna be queen for a night
And you can have whatever you want
Baby, long as you're with me
And I'm gonna roll out the red carpet for ya
And treat you like royalty
If you just wanna be queen for a night
If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight
Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled
Who needs someone to hold you tight
You know I'd love to be the one you always run to
But if you only want me once in a blue moon
You can tell me, baby, it's alright
If you just wanna be queen for a night
Yeah, you can tell me, baby, it's alright
If you just wanna be queen for a night
