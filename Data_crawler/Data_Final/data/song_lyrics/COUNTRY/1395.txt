Song Name: Had To Be There
Stop
Don't blink don't breathe don't think don't move just watch
Don't ruin it tryna find a word there's not
It's a mountain top
It's an Oh My God
Can't believe I'm in the middle of a
Once in a million
Dancing on the ceiling
Pinch me I'm dreaming
If I took a picture it'd be all wrong
Like tryna catch some fireworks on my phone
If I threw this feeling in a frame
It wouldn't be the same
Cause what we got right here right now
It's a "had to be there" thing
It's a "had to be there" thing
Tonight
There's no way that tonight can happen twice
Can't replicate the sunset dropping out the sky
Neon coming off the canvas
Wouldn't understand unless you saw it with your own eyes
If I took a picture it'd be all wrong
Like tryna catch some fireworks on my phone
If I threw this feeling in a frame
It wouldn't be the same
Cause what we got right here right now
It's a "had to be there" thing
It's a "had to be there" thing
Once in a million
Dancing on the ceiling
Pinch me I'm dreaming
If I took a picture
It'd be all wrong
If I took a picture it'd be all wrong
Like tryna catch some fireworks on my phone
If I threw this feeling in a frame
It wouldn't be the same
Cause what we got right here right now
It's a "had to be there" thing
It's a "had to be there" thing
