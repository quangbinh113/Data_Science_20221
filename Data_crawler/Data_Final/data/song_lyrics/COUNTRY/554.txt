Song Name: You've Got to Stand for Something
Now Daddy didn't like trouble
But if it came along, everyone who knew him knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero for this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standing up for what he thought was right
He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything
Now we might have been better off or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backing down
But we always had plenty just living his advice
Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight
He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything
Now I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything
You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything
