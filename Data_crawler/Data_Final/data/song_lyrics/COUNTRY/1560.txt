Song Name: Social Skills
Some people suffer from a social stage fright
Like the world is a sniper with a bright spotlight
You can hide behind a curtain, you can hide behind a mask
But stand in the center with a high ball glass
The whiskey makes it easy to get you out of your rut
And it loosens up the canon ball that's in your gut
But the very next morning, ain't it hard to find that you're leaving every single thing you love behind?
So, I'll drink this gin and I'll take these pills
Just because I don't have social skills
And the whiskey burns and the wine it spills
It's because I don't have social skills
When your hands get clammy and your tongue gets fat
And you'd love to say this but instead you say that
When your heart starts to poundin' like to break your spine
Like it wants to grow legs and find an exit sign
Have another double-double 'til the lines get blurred
'Til the jokes come easy and the phrase gets slurred
And everybody's happy while they're in control
And nothing ever suffers but the liver and the soul
So, I'll drink this gin and I'll take these pills
Just because I don't have social skills
And the whiskey burns and the wine it spills
Just because I don't have social skills
Well, I'll drink this gin and I'll take these pills
Just because I don't have social skills
And the pain it causes is the pain it kills
Is because I don't have social skills
