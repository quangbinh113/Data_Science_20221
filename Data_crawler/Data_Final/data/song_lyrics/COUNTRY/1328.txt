Song Name: Every Other Memory - Acoustic
I still smell the smoke from the fourth of July fireworks
And I still feel the kick drum front row at the concert
After Talladega, safe to say you stick around
We were both drunk at the party, when I told you that I loved you
You laughed like I was crazy, but I swear, girl that's when I knew
What we had, looking back on it right now
That last call, first kiss never left my mind
That old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
Think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset, barefoot, fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you
Girl, you're every other turn down every back road in my head
And even though it's over, you're still playing hard to forget
Close my eyes, and there you are
Still underneath the stars
'Cause that last call, first kiss never left my mind
That old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
Think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset, barefoot, fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you
Girl, it's you
E-every other memory is you and me
Wrapped up in the summer
There will never be another
Never be another
Like that last call, first kiss that never left my mind
And that old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
Think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset, barefoot, fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you
Girl, it's you
E-every other memory is you and me
Tangled in the summer
There will never be another
Never be another
Like that last call, first kiss
