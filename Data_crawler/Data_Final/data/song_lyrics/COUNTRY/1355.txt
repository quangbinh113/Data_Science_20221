Song Name: Settle Up
I'm tired, you're heartbroke
And I've burned through my bill fold
What my tabs at don't tell me
Cause' girl you've run me empty
Yea my visions been blurry, you told me don't worry
But girl we've been too wasted too long
I've pushed in my barstool, my limit's hit damn fool
I'm out the door I'm headed on home
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Empty my pockets till' I've paid what's due
I think i might have spent enough on you
Like the dust all through this bar well past close
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Think I'm gonna settle up on you
Yea I want me a clear mind
But my souls on a decline
Nother' night in a nother' town
But what went's coming back around
I sit on this bar top, neons that won't stop
Telling me what's one other round
So girl imma' call it, this cab man I bought it
Don't need you running me in the ground
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Empty my pockets till' I've paid what's due
I think i might have spent enough on you
Like the dust all through this bar well past close
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Think I'm gonna settle up on you
Yea my visions been blurry, you told me don't worry
But girl we've been too wasted too long
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Empty my pockets till' I've paid what's due
I think i might have spent enough on you
Like the dust all through this bar well past close
I think I'm gonna settle up on you
Think I'm gonna settle up on you
