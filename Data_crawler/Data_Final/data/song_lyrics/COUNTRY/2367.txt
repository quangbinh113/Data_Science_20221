Song Name: Soulshine
When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And it feels like you've lost you're way
When the candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Yeah, you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say
He used to say soul shine
Better than sunshine
It's better than a moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Well now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Life can take the strongest man
And make him feel so alone
Now and then I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my aching bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said boy, in the darkness just before dawn
Let your soul shine
Better than sunshine
I know it's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
People now don't you mind
We all get this way sometimes
You got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when the world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control
Talkin' 'bout soul shine
Better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
It's damn sure better than rain
Well now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Yeah, shine on and on and on and on
Yes, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
It; s damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
