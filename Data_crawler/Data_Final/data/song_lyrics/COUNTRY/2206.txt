Song Name: A Girl's Gotta Do (What A Girl's Gotta Do)
The first thing I did when you said goodbye
Was sit myself down and have a real good cry
The next thing I did was put my red Dress on
And go downtown dancing 'till the break of dawn
A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
And now I gotta get to gettin' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
Fancy meeting you at our stomping ground
Sorry if you caught me painting the town
Guess I shoulda stayed home with your memory
Baby don't take it personally
A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
And now I gotta get to gettin' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
Give me a call some time real soon
And remind me to remember to forget about you, oh yeah!
A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
And now I gotta get to gettin' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
A girls gotta do it
Yeah, a girls gotta do it
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
