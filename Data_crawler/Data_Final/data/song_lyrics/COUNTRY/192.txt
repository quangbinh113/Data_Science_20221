Song Name: Every Little Thing
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heart beatin' with mine

The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine
The sting of every little thing
I guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't wanna sleep with him no more
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine
The sting of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine the sting
Every little thing
They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
'Cause right now I'd die
To not remember every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine
The sting of every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
