Song Name: Hell Of A Way To Go - Acoustic
Me and him was beatin' them banks
Talkin' life and death, Fords and Chevrolets
Said, "Son, we got it made"
"Got a live well full, little sunshine a little shade"
I ain't ready to go today
But when my time comes and if I had it my way
I'd be sittin' on a lake like glass
Catchin' Largemouth Bass
Just my boy and me
Or maybe on a fifty-yard line
Watchin' Alabama whoop up on Tennessee
Or maybe on a front porch swing
Somethin' cold to drink, your momma's hand to hold
And a song on a radio, would be a hell of a way to go
I remember thinkin' that day
I couldn't picture him goin' any other way
Some day when I get old
I can only hope, when the good Lord calls me home
I'd be sittin' on a lake like glass
Catchin' Largemouth Bass
Just my boy and me
Or maybe on a fifty-yard line
Watchin' Alabama whoop up on Tennessee
Or maybe on a front porch swing
Somethin' cold to drink, my baby's hand to hold
And a song on a radio, would be a hell of a way to go
That would be a hell of a way to go
No, he wasn't out fishin' on the day he died
But I bet about the time he closed his eyes
He was sittin' on a lake like glass
Catchin' Largemouth Bass
Just awaitin' on me
Or maybe on a fifty-yard line
Watchin' 'Bama beat the hell out of Tennessee
Or maybe on a front porch swing
Somethin' cold to drink, your momma's hand to hold
And a song on a radio, that's a hell of a way to go
Yeah, that's a hell of a way to go
