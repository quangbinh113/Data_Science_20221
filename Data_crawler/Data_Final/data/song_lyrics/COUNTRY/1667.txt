Song Name: Long, Long Year
Ya ever feel like we've been had?
Baby how'd it ever get this bad?
I was on the porch when you walked away
And I wondered, "Where ya going?"
I fell for you back in March I guess
When ya held me closer than your cigarettes
Now I'm shaking like a leaf on the lawn when a cold wind is blowing
It's been a long, long year, ain't it?
Lost you out in the Golden State
Stuck in traffic on the PCH
June gloom in a motel room and the heat hung low
I watched your smile slowly start to fade
When the daylight chased the stars away
Now our best laid plans don't give a damn anymore
It's been a long long year, ain't it?
Now I'm stumbling
Like a summer wind
That's blown
Now I'm stumbling
Like a summer wind
That's gone
I can still hear ya whispering
"Honey, you don't wanna know where I've been."
I feel like a cloud that's drifting out to sea
