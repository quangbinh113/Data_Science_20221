Song Name: Love Like Crazy
They called them crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what loves about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy
He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yea that's crazy
Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and over use I Love You
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
And they paid like crazy
Just ask him how he made it
He'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman
Who never let him forget
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and over years I Love You
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get too old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?
