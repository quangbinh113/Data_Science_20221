Song Name: She's In Love With The Boy - Single Version
Katie's sittin' on the old front porch
Watchin' the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot goin' on tonight
In this one horse town
Over yonder, comin' up the road
In a beat-up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy, he's layin' on the horn
Splashin' through the mud and the muck
Her daddy says, "He ain't worth a lick
When it comes to brains, he got the short end of the stick"
But Katie's young and man, she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday
Katie and Tommy at the drive-in movie
Parked in the very last row
They're too busy holdin' on to one another
To even care about the show
Later on outside the Tastee Freeze
Tommy slips somethin' on her hand
He says, "My high school ring will have to do
'Til I can buy a weddin' band"
Her daddy says, "He ain't worth a lick
When it comes to brains, he got the short end of the stick"
But Katie's young and man, she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday
Her daddy's waitin' up 'til half past twelve
When they come sneakin' up the walk
He says, "Young lady get on up to your room
While me and junior have a talk"
Mama breaks in, says, "Don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
When you yourself was just a hay-seed plowboy
Who didn't have a row to hoe"
"My daddy said you wasn't worth a lick
When it came to brains, you got the short end of the stick
But he was wrong and honey, you are too
Katie looks at Tommy like I still look at you"
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's gonna marry that boy someday

She's in love with the boy
