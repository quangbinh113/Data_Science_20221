Song Name: Long Haul
I don't ever look back
No, you never gotta
Worry 'bout things like that
So don't think twice because
I ain't afraid of the slow burn
And one thing's for sure
It's good to make a good thing last
So girl, don't worry
This boy ain't gonna run
There ain't no hurry
We got plenty of days left under the sun
No, it ain't a one day ride
It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry
Down through the canyon where the wild things hide
And the cottonwoods fall
Feel the river underneath our feet
We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea
Long as I know that it's you and me
Time don't matter at all
Girl, I'm in it for the long haul
I'm in it for the long haul
Take a hold of my hand
I'm gonna love you
Slow like the hourglass sand
God knows, I've spent a lifetime of lonely wanderin'
But I'm all in for good
I wanna be your man
So girl, don't worry
This boy ain't gonna run
There ain't no hurry
We got plenty of days left under the sun
No, it ain't a one day ride
It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry
Down through the canyon where the wild things hide
And the cottonwoods fall
Feel the river underneath our feet
We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea
Long as I know that it's you and me
Time don't matter at all
Girl, I'm in it for the long haul
I'm in it for the long haul
Girl, I'm in it 'til the end
Forever and again
I'm in it for the long haul
I don't ever look back
No, you never gotta
Worry 'bout things like that
