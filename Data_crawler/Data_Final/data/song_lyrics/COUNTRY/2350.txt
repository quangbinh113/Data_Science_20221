Song Name: Feats Don't Fail Me Now
Your daddy says I'm no good
Your mama says keep away
I got to tell you truthful, girl, you can never make me stay
I got somethin' up and down this road
I'll bet you my last dollar, girl, I could give you love the most
Don't the sunrise look so pretty - never such a sight
Like rollin' into New York City with the skyline in the morning light
Roll right through the night (roll)
Roll right through the night (I said, roll)
Semi-smokin' mama, you got to give me some
I heard you got the biggest, ooo, the biggest truck in town
Ride on through to Baltimore - you got to love me now
Catch it to me gently - feets don't fail me now (don't fail me)
Feets don't fail me now (don't fail me)
Don't the sunrise look so pretty - never such a sight
Like rollin' into New York City with the skyline in the morning light
Roll right through the night (I said, roll)
Roll right through the night (roll right through the night)
