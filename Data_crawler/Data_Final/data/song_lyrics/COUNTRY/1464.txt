Song Name: Some Things Never Change
I like the shades you're wearing
And I like your new tattoo
I see you went and dyed your hair
And got a new perfume
I should've known you'd be here
Dancing to a fiddle song
Kicking up dust and stirring up memories
Blurring lines between right and wrong
But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long
When the lights come up and the smoke clears, you'll be gone
Like a lightening strike sheds light on falling rain
Some things never change
I feel there's still a sliver
Of my old love worn soul
Tangled inside your heart
That I lost long ago
'Cause longing don't seem to matter
How many years go by
You and me, we fit together
We don't even have to try
But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long
When the lights come up and the smoke clears, you'll be gone
Like a bonfire fades when it runs out of flame
Some things never change
Will the way you feel remain the same?
They say true love finds a way
No, the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long
When the lights come up and the smoke clears, you'll be gone
And I'll be by myself as the sun shines on my shame
Some things never change
Some things never change
Some things never change
