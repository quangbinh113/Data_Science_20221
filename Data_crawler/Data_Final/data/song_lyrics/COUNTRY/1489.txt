Song Name: In the Dark
Where'd you go baby
How'd you disappear
Did you go looking for freedom
In some town far away from here
Cause I can see you in the distance
Of a faded memory
I should've known you had your fingers crossed
Every time you said that you loved me
Now I can't find a single answer
Cause you left me in the dark
How am I supposed to carry onward
What am I supposed to tell my heart
Well there's whiskey in the bottle
But it won't be there for long
If I keep asking all these questions
Wondering if I did something wrong
Now I'm locked up in our bedroom
Like a prisoner in a cell
I spend too much time thinking about you
And too many nights going through hell
Now I can't find a single answer
Cause you left me in the dark
How am I supposed to carry onward
What am I supposed to tell my heart
Cause I still love you
Oh what a foolish thing to say
Cause I'm sure I have not crossed your mind
In at least a hundred days
Oh but I just want you
To light my world up once again
I can't accept the fact
That you and I have reached the end
And I wish I would've known you
Were going to leave me feeling blue
It makes me wonder why I ever
Wasted all my time loving you
Now I can't find a single answer
Cause you left me in the dark
How am I supposed to carry onward
What am I supposed to tell my heart now
Where'd you go baby
How'd you disappear
Did you go looking for freedom
In some town far away from here
