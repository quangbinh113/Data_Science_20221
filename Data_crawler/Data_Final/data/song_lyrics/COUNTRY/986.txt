Song Name: Dancing Shoes
Put on your old black dress
And grab your dancing shoes
Head out to the old bar Rose
And we'll dance away our blues
Spent all week waiting
Now my mind's on you
Hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
Yeah, yeah
I'm so tired of the nine to five
Weighing down on my soul
Let's get out all of this uptown life
And head out on the country road
Forget about all the things that
We can't make right
Put on a little Emmyloo
And we'll dance into the night
Singing, hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
I said, hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
Come on
All we need is time, honey
No, no, all we need is time
Honey, I don't
Don't run from the love
Sit on the front porch
Kick off your shoes
We don't need nowhere to go
We don't need a tune
In a world
That gets lost in making plans
Just be my woman
Yeah, and I will be your man
Yeah
All we need is time, alright
Yeah, yeah, all we need is time
Hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
I said, hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
Singing, hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
I said, hold my loving arms
My loving arms are for you
Put on your old black dress
And grab your dancing shoes
Head out to the old bar Rose
And we'll dance away our blues
