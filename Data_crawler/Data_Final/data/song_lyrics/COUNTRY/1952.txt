Song Name: Break My Heart Again
It's been 27 days since I saw you on the Westside
I've been tryna find a way to get over that you're not mine
You were standin' on the corner in the shirt I love
Same one you were wearin' when you called it off
27 days since I saw you and I'm not fine
It's true, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I should know better than fallin' for someone like you, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
One look at you and I'm all in
So, break my heart again, break my heart again
You could be gone in the morning
I wouldn't mind if it meant I got one more night
Love drunk on your skin, don't care where we've been
If I could have you in the end
I'd let you break my heart over and over again
Oh, no
It's so hard to be in love when I hate you at the same time
Stayed up after every fight just to make it, make it alright
Oh, my friends, they tell me you'll never be good for me
And every time it kills me when you leave
It's so hard to be in love when you're feelin' it from both sides, oh-oh, ooh-woah
It's true, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I should know better than fallin' for someone like you, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
One look at you and I'm all in
Break my heart again, break my heart again
You could be gone in the morning
I wouldn't mind if it meant I got one more night
Love drunk on your skin, don't care where we've been
If I could have you in the end
I'd let you break my heart over and over again
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh, oh, ah, ah
Break my heart again, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
You could be gone in the morning
I wouldn't mind if it meant I got one more night
Love drunk on your skin, don't care where we've been
If I could have you in the end
I'd let you break my heart over and over again
Ooh, ooh-ooh, heart again
You could be gone in the morning
I wouldn't mind if it meant I got one more night
Love drunk on your skin, don't care where we've been
If I could have you in the end
I'd let you break my heart over and over again
