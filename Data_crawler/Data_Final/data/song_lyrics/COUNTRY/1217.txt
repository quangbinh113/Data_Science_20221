Song Name: The Long Way
Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wanderin' around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you got it all together
So if you don't mind I'd like to know you better
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown
I want your red blushin' stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around
