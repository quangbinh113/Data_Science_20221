Song Name: Your Man
Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feelin' quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

There's no hurry, don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Let's go over what I had in mind
Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
Ain't nobody, ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how long I've wanted to
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feelin' that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
