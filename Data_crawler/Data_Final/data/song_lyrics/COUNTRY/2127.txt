Song Name: Long Live Cowgirls (with Cody Johnson)
She's a gooseneck on a dually
A long neck at the bar
Loves old John Wayne movies
Waltzin' under them stars
She's sun up in the saddle
Cuttin' through the heard
Loves brandin' her cattle
Long live cowgirls
Well, she rode in them wagons
When the Wild West was won
Took the canyons and badlands
And made 'em her home
She's boots on, Ledoux songs
And snaps on her pearls
Long live cowgirls
Like a paint-colored mustang
She's fast and she's wild
Stop a runaway freight train
With her high-country smile
She's tough as December
Salt of the earth
Make you fall like September
Long live cowgirls
Well, she rode in them wagons
When the Wild West was won
Took the canyons and badlands
And made 'em her home
She's boots on, Chris Ledoux songs
And snaps on her pearls
She's been there and she'll be here
'Til the end of the world
Long live cowgirls
