Song Name: Time Is Cold (Coffee House Version)
Time is cold
No, it don't care
When you want more, theres none to spare
It'll tick tock right behind our backs
Run off, leave us in the past
Who knows
Time is cold
Blink once, it'll slip on by
Lets take this moment and hold on tight
If we ever let it go, its gonna fly away
Time is cold, baby
Let me keep you warm
Time is cold
Loves a blanket,
It wont stand still,
Unless we make it
So come on, take my hand lets slow it down
And make every last second count
Cuz I know time is cold
Blink once it'll slip on by
Lets take this moment and hold on tight
If we ever let it go its gonna fly away
Time is cold, baby
So let me keep you warm
By my side, through the night
Of the rest of our lives
Blink once, it'll slip on by
Lets take this moment and hold on tight
If we ever let it go its gonna fly away
So let me keep you warm
Cuz time is cold, baby
Time is cold, baby
Let me keep you warm
