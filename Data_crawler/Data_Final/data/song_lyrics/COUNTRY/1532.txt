Song Name: Blue Yodel Number 9
Standin' on the corner I didn't mean no harm
Along come a police he took me by the arm
It was down in Memphis on the corner of Beale and Main
He says big boy you'll have to tell me your name
I said you'll find my name on the tail of my shirt
I'm a Tennessee hustler I don't have to work
So listen all you rounders you better leave my women alone
Cause I'll take my Special and run all you rounders home
My good gal love me, everybody knows
And she paid a hundred cash dollars to buy me a suit of clothes
She come to the joint, a forty-four in each hand
She said "step aside all you women and men
'Cause I'm looking for my man"
