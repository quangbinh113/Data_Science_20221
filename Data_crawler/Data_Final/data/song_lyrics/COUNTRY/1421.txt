Song Name: Heart Attack
You've been saying what I wanna hear
Straight from the shine of your eyes
To my ears
I've been hanging on
Every word you didn't say
Let's make the most of this moment
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Let a spark turn into a fire
Let it burn into the night
Let love walk us out on a wire
Girl, don't hold back
Let your heart attack mine
Any walls around this heart all fall to the ground
When you walk in the room and I see you all guards are down
Your love is like an arrow
Go on and pull that bow
I'm a willing easy target
Take your aim and let it go
Let a spark turn into a fire
Let it burn into the night
Let love walk us out on a wire
Girl, don't hold back
Let your heart attack mine
Let a spark turn into a fire
Let it burn into the night
Let love walk us out on a wire
Girl, don't hold back
Let your heart attack
Let a spark turn into a fire
Let it burn into the night
Let love walk us out on a wire
Girl, don't hold back
Let your heart attack mine
