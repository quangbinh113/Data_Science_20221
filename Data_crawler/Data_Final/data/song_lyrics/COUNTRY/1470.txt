Song Name: High on the Bottle
White lines here on this highway, roll on forever
This tear in my heart, it won't ever fall
I guess that is why I'm a country music singer
High on the bottle, addicted to the pain
I could've been with a beautiful Christian woman
She loved me so but I had to walk away
'Cause I can't be good out on the road
The women that I meet, they all seem to know
I'm high on the bottle, addicted to the pain
So show me the way to the stage in this bar
Let it fill with people that have broken hearts
And I'll play a sad song 'bout the hurting and the cheating
High on the bottle, addicted to the pain
This honky-tonk life that I lead, it suits me just fine
This shot of Jim Beam goes real good with this joint in my hand
I've never been one to follow the rules, none
Just high on the bottle, addicted to the pain
So show me the way to the stage in this bar
Let it fill with people that have broken hearts
And I'll play a sad song 'bout the hurting and the leaving
High on the bottle, addicted to the pain
I'll play a sad song 'bout the hurting and the cheating
High on the bottle, addicted to the pain
I stay high on the bottle, addicted to the pain
