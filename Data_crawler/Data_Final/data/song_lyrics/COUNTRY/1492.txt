Song Name: Crash Landing
I can smell your perfume on my pillow
The wind blows through the curtains like a ghost
And there's broken glass all around your picture
And your black dress is on my bedpost
You're everything I've ever dreamed of and wanted
You're gone, I'm here, you're there with him, left me haunted
Can't make a wish, my lucky star has been daunted
And I can't sleep for missing you, God Speed
I could sure use some understanding
And a little bit of mercy come morning light
I can feel my heart headed for a crash landing
And I could use your love tonight
I could find someone to hold me tight
Just a temporary fix to help take flight
And I tell my momma that I'm doing alright
'Cause I don't want to see her cry
You know I know that two rights don't make a wrong and
You can only fly so high for so long and
Heartaches make for one heck of a song
So baby, take your sweet time breaking mine
I could sure use some understanding
And a little bit of mercy come morning light
I can feel my heart headed for a crash landing
And I can use your love tonight
You're everything I've ever dreamed of and wanted
You're gone, I'm here, you're there with him, left me haunted
Can't make a wish, my lucky star has been daunted
And I can't sleep for missing you, God Speed
You know I know that two rights don't make a wrong and
You can only fly so high for so long and
Heartaches make for one heck of a song
So baby, take your sweet time breaking mine
I could sure use some understanding
And a little bit of mercy come morning light
I can feel my heart headed for a crash landing
And I could use your love tonight
Well, I could use your love tonight
