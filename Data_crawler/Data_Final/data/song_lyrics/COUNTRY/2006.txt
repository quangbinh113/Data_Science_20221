Song Name: Dirt Road (Remix) (feat. BRELAND)
I should have never called last night
We break up, we make up and then we do it again
I need another beer
Don't want my vision clear
Small town so I see you everywhere
Dirt roads and four wheel drives
Headlights and shiny nights
Right now that sounds real nice
To get your name off of my mind
Whoa
Windows down, speakers bumpin' like
Whoa
Live my life like a dirt road
Take it slow
Let's see how far we can go
When tomorrow comes, we can do it again
Lovin', drinkin', fightin' with all my friends
Oh
Windows down, speakers bumpin' like
Oh
Live my life like a dirt road
Kickin' up dust, slingin' rocks
Shotgun rider, watch for cops
The neighbors hate us, want us to stop
Bass too loud but we can't stop
I done forgot about you and all your games
Do not tell me that I'm swervin', this dirt road don't have a lane
My buddy Nicky out the window, AR15 got good aim
Copenhagen got me buzzin', got me spinnin' in my brain
If I take this turn too fast, it might hit me back
So I grab the wheel, relax, and I drop it into second
County boy is what I'm reppin'
Beretta and Smith & Wessons
Never hidin', I've been ridin'
This old dirt road got me slidin'
I should have never called last night
We break up, we make up and we do it again
I need another beer
Don't want my vision clear
Small town so I see you everywhere
Oh
Windows down, speakers bumpin' like
Oh
Live my life like a dirt road
Oh
Windows down, speakers bumpin' like
Oh
Lord, thank you for this dirt road
