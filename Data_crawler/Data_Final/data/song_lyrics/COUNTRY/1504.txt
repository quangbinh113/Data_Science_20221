Song Name: May Peace Find You Tonight
May peace find you tonight
Like a breeze through your window
And sit by your light
Let it warm by your fire
And laugh with delight
Like a heavenly choir
May peace find you tonight
You've got your god
Sister I've got mine
And I know that he's out there somewhere
He bails me out sometimes
And I've always believed
But sometimes I question the truth
But all the proof that I need
Is the love that I've found in you
May peace find you tonight
Like a breeze through your window
And sit by your light
And let it warm by your fire
And laugh with delight
Like a heavenly choir
May peace find you tonight
May your soul reunite with the one that you lost long ago
May a troublesome heart be a feeling you'll never know
May your spirit be free as the wind on the wings of the dove
May your heart know the way loud and clear like a voice from above
May peace find you tonight
Like a breeze through your window
And sit by your light
And let it warm by your fire
And laugh with delight
Like a heavenly choir
May peace find you tonight
Like a heavenly choir
May peace find you tonight
