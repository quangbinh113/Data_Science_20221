Song Name: Nobody's More Country
Woo-hoo
Well, pickup trucks and four-wheel drives
Have been my thing since '99
When Tim McGraw was all we ever sang
The long tan legs and Daisy Dukes
Them cut off shirts and dirt on boots
No matter where I'm at, it's still my thing
I've been back and forth from here to Georgia
Carolina to California
Across the hills of middle Tennessee
I've been mountain high in Colorado
Seen some things, but one thing I know
No one loves the country more than me
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
(No one loves the country more than me) woo-hoo
I'll drive a dirt road over paved
I'll slow it down, I like the pace
That simple life just simply hard to beat, yep
And I love them open acres, fields of gold
That paradise that I call home
My party here, no better place to be
That's right
I've been back and forth from here to Georgia
Carolina to California
Across the hills of middle Tennessee
I've been mountain high in Colorado
Seen some things, but one thing I know
No one loves the country more than me
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
(No one loves the country more than me) woo-hoo
I said no one
I mean no one
Nah, no one loves the country more than me
I said no one
I mean no one
Nah, no one loves the country more than me
I've been back and forth from here to Georgia
Carolina to California
Across the hills of middle Tennessee
I've been mountain high in Colorado
Seen some things, but one thing I know
No one loves the country more than me
I've been back and forth from here to Georgia
Carolina to California
No one loves the country more than me
I said, no one loves the country more than me
