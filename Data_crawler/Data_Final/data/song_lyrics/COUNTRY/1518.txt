Song Name: Boots
Just like that neon sign, I'm buzzing
Just like that full moon, I'm so high
No, it's not what you think, it's not from the drink
It's not from something I'm smoking
Makes me feel like I can fly
When you're in these arms of mine
I'm up on cloud nine
On the dance floor floating around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
I never want this night to end
You got me three sheets to the wind
Like a record we're spinning around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
When I fall and hit rock bottom
When my star comes crashing to the ground
My soft place to land, my steady right hand
You make it all good, you make me feel like a man
You lift me up, you never let me down
Lord knows that you never let me down
When you're in these arms of mine
I'm up on cloud nine
On the dance floor floating around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
I never want this night to end
You got me three sheets to the wind
Like a record we're spinning around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
Yeah, all my dreams come true
Come morning light waking up next to you, right next to you
Soft candle light, California red
I can't keep my boots on the ground tonight when they're underneath your bed
Baby
When you're in these arms of mine
I'm up on cloud nine
On the dance floor floating around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
I never want this night to end
You got me three sheets to the wind
Like a record we're spinning around
And I can't keep my boots on the ground
Yeah, you're looking so fine
You got me up on cloud nine
Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground
Come on kiss me and then, kiss me again and again
Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground
