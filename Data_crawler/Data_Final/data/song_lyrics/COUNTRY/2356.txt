Song Name: Coming Home
From the Mason-Dixon Line
Through the hills of Caroline
Oh, I'm comin' home
Lookin' back on these ninety days
Hotel blues and the gigs we've played
Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin home to you baby
I'm comin home, yeah, yeah
It's been a long, long time and
I've got Georgia on my mind
Oh, I'm comin' home
Got a lady waitin' for me
But I'm as tired as I can be
Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin home to you baby
I'm comin home, yeah, yeah
Oh, Interstate 85
I'm just startin' to come alive
Oh, I'm comin' home
I can see those distant lights
I got Peachtree Plaza in my sights
Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home to you, baby
I'm comin' home to you, baby
I'm comin' home
Oh, I'm comin' home to you, baby
Just like I said I would
I'm comin' home to you, baby
(I'm comin' home)
I'm comin' home to you, baby
I'm comin' home to you, baby
(I'm comin' home)
I'm comin' home to you, baby
