Song Name: Cairo, IL
All the fields are flooded up to Highway 51
Illinois is coming 'cross the bridge where the Old Ohio was
Don't look away, it will be gone
Kentucky and Missouri, a trinity of states
Nothing's in a hurry 'cept the water in between the rising banks
Oh nothing moves but nothing stays
Where the longing for the leaving and the welcome home receiving join
Still I'll keep driving past the ghost of Cairo, Illinois
She used to be a beauty back in 1891
After Fort Defiance, now she's weathered by the river and the sun
She's still around but she is gone
Where the longing for the leaving and the welcome home receiving join
Still I'll keep driving past the ghost of Cairo, Illinois
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Where the longing for the leaving and the welcome home receiving join
Still I'll keep driving past the ghost of Cairo, Illinois
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Illinois
