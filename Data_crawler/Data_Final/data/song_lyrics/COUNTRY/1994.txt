Song Name: Son Of A Sinner
I never get lonely
I get these ghosts to keep me company
I took the rearview off of this old Ford
So I only see in front of me
Now the past is out of sight and out of mind
Swore I changed, now I'm back chasing these white lines
I'm just a long-haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I'm a pedal to the highway
If you ever wonder why we write these songs
'Cause I'm only one drink away from the devil
I'm only one call away from home
Yeah, I'm somewhere in the middle
I guess I'm just a little right and wrong
These backroads got me
These pills pretend to be my friend
I'm done for the last time
I'm lying to myself again
I always say that
Now I'm on my way back here somehow
I should know by now
I'm just a long-haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I'm a pedal to the highway
If you ever wonder why we write these songs
'Cause I'm only one drink away from the devil
I'm only one call away from home
Yeah, I'm somewhere in the middle
I guess I'm just a little right and wrong
Mistakes I made, I paid for them in cash
Walked a million miles on broken glass
I'm feeling like I'm fading
My heart's been slowly breaking
Might pop a pill and smoke and maybe drink
Talk to God and tell Him what I think
At first He's gonna hate me
But eventually He'll save me
I'm just a long-haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I'm a pedal to the highway
If you ever wonder why we write these songs
'Cause I'm only one drink away from the devil
I'm only one call away from home
Yeah, I'm somewhere in the middle
I guess I'm just a little right and wrong
