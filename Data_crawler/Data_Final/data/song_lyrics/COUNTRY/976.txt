Song Name: Sunday Drive
They didn't ever say where we were going
We just climbed into the backseat
Eyes wide open to the picture show outside
I guess we really didn't understand it all
Remember looking up at them in the front row
Hands touched together, almost out of sight
It's been a long, hard week, but now the slow release
Of a Sunday afternoon
And we were only young
But they were trying hard to reach us
How was I to know
That there was something so worth keepin'?
'Cause we were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time

Out on a Sunday drive
The sun warms your soul just like an old friend
Singing songs along that ribbon of a road

And everyone you love is sitting there so close
You're never thinking that you'd ever get old
No, you'll never get old
Just watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time
Out on a Sunday drive, oh
I never said where we were going
I just helped them to the backseat

Dad just laughed and said, "Son, don't drive too far
Your momma gets pretty tired these days"

After a few miles I guess they recognized some places
And I listened as they reminisced
About a world that they had always known
And how it's changin'
Probably never gonna be the same again
I caught 'em in the mirror
They were holding hands and smiling
Looking younger than they'd been in years
Oh, through all the years
And they were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time
Out on a Sunday drive
Out on a Sunday drive
Out on a Sunday drive
Out on a Sunday drive
