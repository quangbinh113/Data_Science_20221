Song Name: Marry That Girl
The first time that I met her
She was pouring shots of rum
Told me that her cousin just turned 21
She took my hand and said we're dancing
When they played her favorite song
We didn't stop 'til everybody else was gone
I'm gonna change her name, but she don't know it yet
She's what I've been praying someday God would send
I ain't never been the same since we first met
I'm gonna marry that girl
I'm gonna marry that girl
My best friends tired of hearing
Me talk about her smile
He says "You've only known her for a little while"
My mama keeps on saying
I better take it slow
I just say I will, but I already know
I'm gonna change her name, but she don't know it yet
She's what I've been praying someday God would send
I ain't never been the same since we first met
I'm gonna marry that girl
I'm gonna marry that girl
I'll pick the perfect ring
I'll pick the perfect time
Ask her if she'll have me for the rest of her life
I'm gonna change her name, but she don't know it yet
She's what I've been praying someday God would send
I ain't never been the same since we first met
I'm gonna marry that girl
I'm gonna marry that girl
Gonna change her name
I'm gonna buy that ring
I'm gonna marry that girl
I'm gonna marry that girl
