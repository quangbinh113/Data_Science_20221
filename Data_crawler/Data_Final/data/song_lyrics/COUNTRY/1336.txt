Song Name: Knock
I hate to call you Patsy Cline but girl you actin' crazy
Gettin' kinda hard to watch
He's been droppin' warnin' signs like petals off a daisy
Lookin' like a "loves me not" (oh)
Oh, you've been locked outside of an empty room
But your mama didn't raise no fool
You don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby
The world won't stop if it's just not in the cards
That you've been playin' with baby, baby
Why waste all your nights on love
That won't come back your way? Hey
You don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby
Yeah, the 1950s called and begging's out of fashion
Them boots should take a walk (oh)
Honestly, you got mystery all twisted up with passion
You see, a door is just a wall
Yeah, you don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby
The world won't stop if it's just not in the card
That you've been playin' with baby, baby
Why waste all your nights on love
That won't come back your way? Hey
You don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby (hey, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, you've been locked outside of an empty room
But your mama didn't raise no fool
(You don't have to knock)
You don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby
The world won't stop if it's just not in the cards
That you've been playin' with baby, baby
Why waste all your nights on love
That won't come back your way? Hey
You don't have to knock, knock, knock
On a heart that opens up for you baby, baby
(That opens up for you, baby)
On love that won't come back your way
