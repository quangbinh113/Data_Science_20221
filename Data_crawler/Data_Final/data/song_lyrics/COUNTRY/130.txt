Song Name: You Look So Good In Love
Oh, how you sparkle
And oh, how you shine
The flush on your cheeks
Is more than the wine
And he must do something
That I didn't do
Whatever he's doing
It looks good on you
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish you still wanted me
He must have stolen
Some stars from the sky
And gave them to you
To wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder
Why I couldn't see
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish you still wanted me
Darling I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you away please let me say
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish you still wanted me
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
