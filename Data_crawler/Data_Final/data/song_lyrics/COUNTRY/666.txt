Song Name: The Bones
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good, mmm
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good
Bones are good
The rest, the rest don't matter (baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel
The glass could shatter (oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good
The rest, the rest don't matter (ooh)
Paint could peel
The glass, the glass could shatter (yeah)
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (whoo, glass could shatter)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (whoo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good, ooh
