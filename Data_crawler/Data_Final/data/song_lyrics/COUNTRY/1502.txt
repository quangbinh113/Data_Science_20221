Song Name: Slow
Slow like the hands on a punch out clock
Like a red dirt drive with the head lights off
Sixteen sneaking in trying not to get caught
Crawling in the through the window
That kind of slow like a summer storm rolling in
Like Friday night lights kicking off again
Like a front porch swing, just swingin' in the wind
It's how I talk
How I wanna live
How I wanna steal all of your kisses
And baby I'm tired of driving in the fast lane
This rat race is driving me insane
So baby tonight, you and I, take our time, get it right
Nice and slow
Slow like the midnight Marlboro Red
We shared on the gate the night we met
How that sweet Four Roses whiskey messed, with every word we said
It's how I talk
How I wanna live
How I wanna steal all of your kisses
And baby I'm tired of driving in the fast lane
This rat race is driving me insane
So baby tonight, you and I, take our time, get it right
Nice and slow
Yeah, nice and slow
Slow right through that bedroom door
Slow like your red dress hits the floor
Slow like I'm going to lay you down
Yeah, I'm going to lay you down
It's how I talk
How I wanna live
How I wanna steal all of your kisses
And baby I'm tired of driving in the fast lane
This rat race is driving me insane
So baby tonight, you and I, take our time, get it right
Nice and slow
Yeah, nice and slow
