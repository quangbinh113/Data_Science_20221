Song Name: Chattahoochee
Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little 'bout love
Well, we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little 'bout love
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little 'bout love
A lot about living and a little 'bout love
Yeah-hoo!
That's right
