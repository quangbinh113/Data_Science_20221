Song Name: Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American)
American Girls
And American Guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recognize
When we see Ol' Glory flyin'
There's a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night
When we lay down our head
My daddy served in the army
Where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard
'Til the day that he died
He wanted my mother
My brother
My sister and me
To grow up and live happy
In the Land of the Free
Now this nation that I love
Has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in
From somewhere in the back
As soon as we could see clearly
Through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world
Like the 4th of July
Hey Uncle Sam, put your name
At the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the Eagle will fly
And it's gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you, courtesy
Of the Red, White, and Blue
Oh
And justice will be served
And the battle will rage
This big dog will fight
When you rattle his cage
And you'll be sorry that messed with
The U-S-of-A
'Cause we'll put a boot your ass
It's the American way
Hey Uncle Sam, put your name
At the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the Eagle will fly
And it's gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you, courtesy
Of the Red, White, and Blue
Oh-oh
Of the Red, White, and Blue
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Of my Red, White, and Blue
