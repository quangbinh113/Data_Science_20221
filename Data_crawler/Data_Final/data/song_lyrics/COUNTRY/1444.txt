Song Name: How Lucky Am I
Baby, pass the honey wine
That cowboy hat fits you awful nice
With every drink I'm scootin' closer to your side
Since when am I the one to make all the moves
With you I feel like I can break all the rules
Well, how lucky am I to be sitting with you
I'd drive every night into the western sky
With the sun bright in my eyes for you to
Take my heart, waste my gas, and take my time
How lucky am I
How lucky am I
Can we just lay here and listen to the rain?
Saying "I love you" is all I wanna say
Well, how lucky am I for you to feel the same
I'll tell you the reasons why the time was right
When you came around
No, I couldn't fight it
Hell, I didn't even wanna try
Your heart is everything mine lacks
I like when you laugh with everything you have
Well, how lucky am I to have a better half
Yeah, I'd drive every night into the western sky
With the sun bright in my eyes for you to
Take my heart, waste my gas, and take my time
How lucky am I
How lucky am I
Sometimes you'll be miles away
But I'll think to myself "hey, that's okay"
Cause you'll be back around soon
Just one more day
Cause when you know, you know
Yeah, you can't deny
I hope forever that you'll be mine
Cause you're the one I want
I'll sing it one more time
Yeah, I'd drive every night into the western sky
With the sun bright in my eyes for you to
Take my heart, waste my gas, and take my time
How lucky am I
How lucky am I
How lucky am I
How lucky am I
