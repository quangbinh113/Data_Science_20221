Song Name: At Christmas
It's my favorite time of year
Doorbells ringing, everybody's here
Barely any room in the dining room tonight
Pecan pie better warm it up
Bubbles flowing, Better fill your cup
Love and laughter up to the rafters, alright
No place that I'd rather be
Than with my friends and family 'cause
All the lights are so much brighter
Being with the ones you love by the fire
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
Snow is falling
My heart is singing
Here's a toast to the joy it's bringing
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
You can feel it everywhere you go
The whole town's wrapped up in a bow
It's the best kinda livin' when everybody's giving a smile
No place that I'd rather be
Than with my friends and family cause
All the lights are so much brighter
Being with the ones you love by the fire
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
Snow is falling
My heart is singing
Here's a toast to the joy it's bringing
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
