Song Name: Blue Ain't Your Color
I can see you over there
Starring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink
All alone tonight
And chances are
You're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while
Baby
Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color
I'm not tryna
Be another just
Pick you up
Kinda guy
Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home
But I just don't understand
How another man
Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold
Well, I've had enough to drink
And it's makin' me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright
Baby
'Cause blue looks good on the sky

Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color no no no
It ain't your color baby
Baby, blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes

I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color
Blue ain't your color
Mmmm, oh no no baby
Come here baby
Let me light up your world
