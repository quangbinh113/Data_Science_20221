Song Name: Delorean
Oh, I ain't heard this song in a minute
I forget who sings it but I remember turning it up
Showing you how my bass could shake the rearview
Remember you chewed ice breakers next to me at church
Smelling like bath and body works
In that dress with that texture, I love to touch so much
Baby, all that stuff does me like a DeLorean
Put me in the backseat of your Accord again
Losing your shirt on the floorboard again, like good Lord again (good Lord)
Green numbers on the clock and the dash tick-tock says 4 a.m.
Yeah, you're daddy's gonna hate me even more again, girl, it's crazy
Ain't no telling what's gon' take me back to our love's origin
Just like that DeLorean

Anything bone thugs in the speakers
Anything airbrushed on the t-shirt
Little rum on the back of a French kiss
Little hit of some herbal essences
I don't wanna go back to the future
I just wanna cruise, girl (cruise with you, girl)
In a DeLorean, put me in the backseat of your Accord again
Losing your shirt on the floorboard again, like good Lord again (good Lord)
Green numbers on the clock and the dash tick-tock says 4 a.m.
Yeah, you're daddy's gonna hate me even more again, girl, it's crazy
Ain't no telling what's gon' take me back to our love's origin
Just like that DeLorean
Can't tell me there ain't no such thing (can't tell me)
As a time machine (can't tell me)
Can't tell me there ain't no such thing (can't tell me there ain't no such thing
As a time machine)
Can't tell me there ain't no such thing (can't tell me)
As a time machine (can't tell me)
Can't tell me there ain't no such thing
I just wanna ride in that DeLorean
Put me in the backseat of your Accord again
Losing your shirt on the floorboard again, like good Lord again (good Lord)
Green numbers on the clock and the dash tick-tock says 4 a.m.
Yeah, you're daddy's gonna hate me even more again, girl, it's crazy
Ain't no telling what's gon' take me back to our love's origin
Just like that DeLorean
Ain't no telling what's gon' take me back
Ain't no telling what's gon' take me back to our love's origin
Baby, all that stuff does me like a DeLorean
