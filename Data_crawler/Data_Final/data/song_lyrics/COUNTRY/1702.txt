Song Name: 100 Proof
26, he flipped a switch
Pulled himself out of a ditch
27, he had a plan
Stand up tall and be a man
He said if it's sad, I'll cry
If it's funny, I'll laugh
If I lose my way, I'll just stop and ask
And if someone asks me how I feel
I'll just tell them the truth
And if kindness were a spirit, I'll be
100 proof
Faithful, couldn't ask for more
True love knocked upon his door
35, a baby girl
Came along and changed his world
He said if it's sad, cry
If it's funny, you'll laugh
If you lose your way, just stop and ask
And if someone asks you how you feel
Just tell them the truth
And if kindness were a spirit, be
100 proof
52, felt like the end
A broken heart that wouldn't mend
53, he'd found the key
In that old recipe
If you're sad, cry
If it's funny, you'll laugh
If you lose your way, just stop and ask
And if someone asks you how you feel
Just tell them the truth
And if kindness were a spirit, be
100 proof
A hundred and one but still having fun
Enjoying all the rerun
By a hundred and two, he was through
And his family gathered as families do
They said if you were sad, he'd cry
If you were funny, he'd laugh
And if you lost your way, he'd help you find the path
And if he asked you how you felt
You'd always tell him the truth
Because if kindness were a spirit, he'd be
100 proof
They said if you were sad, he'd cry
If you were funny, he'd laugh
And if you lost your way, he'd help you find the path
And if he asked you how you felt
You'd always tell him the truth
Because if kindness were a spirit, he'd be
100 proof
If kindness were a spirit, he'd be
100 proof
