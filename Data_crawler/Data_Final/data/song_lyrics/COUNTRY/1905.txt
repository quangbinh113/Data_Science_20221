Song Name: Rather Be Broke
If I had a Rolex weighing down my wrist
If I could write checks with a bunch of zeros in it
If I had a G-5 flying high, 10-figure dollar signs
Like a billionaire, but you weren't there
I'd rather be broke
Penny pinching just to stay afloat
Instead of wishing for the stuff I don't need
'Cause I got you and baby girl, you got me
If I had to choose a big house with an ocean view
And being rich or being with you, alone, holding me close
On a hand-me-down couch at home
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke)
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke, yeah)
I'd trade a downtown bar for our back porch
Yeah, they got five stars, but we got a couple million more
I can have the world, but to me it wouldn't matter
Without you girl, yeah, you know
I'd rather be broke
Penny pinching just to stay afloat
Instead of wishing for the stuff I don't need
'Cause I got you and baby girl, you got me
If I had to choose a big house with an ocean view
And being rich or being with you, alone, holding me close
On a hand-me-down couch at home
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke)
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke, yeah)
I said I'd rather be broke
Penny pinching just to stay afloat
Instead of wishing for the stuff I don't need
'Cause I got you and baby girl, you got me
If I had to choose a big house with an ocean view
And being rich or being with you, alone, holding me close
On a hand-me-down couch at home
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke)
I'd rather be broke (broke, broke)
Yeah, I'd rather be broke (broke, broke)
I'd rather be, broke
