Song Name: I'd Be You
Funny running into you in this old bar tonight
Everything in me wants to run up and start a fight
'Cause I got kicked to the curb and you got her
The rest is history
But, hey man, I ain't mad at you
But I'm damn sure pissed at me
'Cause if I'd have just been her shoulder, instead of turning my back
If I'd have swallowed my pride, instead of shooting that Jack
If I'd had just paid attention, instead of paying no mind
If I'd have gave her my heart, instead of hell all the time
I'd be you
Driving her car back to her place, guess you could say I'd be you
Wreckin' her bed, stuck on her mind, she'd bе still mine
I'd be you
Yeah, hindsight surе don't come with no time machine
And when the day is done I'm the smoking gun
I bet you'd agree
Well, if it wasn't for me there wouldn't be no you
Ain't nothing ever been more clear
Yeah, shake my hand, you're welcome, man
You oughta buy me a beer
'Cause if I'd have just been her shoulder, instead of turning my back
If I'd have swallowed my pride, instead of shooting that Jack
If I'd had just paid attention, instead of paying no mind
If I'd have gave her my heart, instead of hell all the time
I'd be you
Driving her car back to her place, guess you could say I'd be you
Wreckin' her bed, stuck on her mind, she'd be still mine
I'd be you
(Yeah, I'd be you)
I had my chance but I went and blew it
Now she gone, moved on, like there's nothing to it
So don't mess with her heart or she'll put you on the shelf
You'll end up like me, thinking to yourself
If I'd have just been her shoulder, instead of turning my back
If I'd have swallowed my pride, instead of shooting that Jack
If I'd had just paid attention, instead of paying no mind
If I'd have gave her my heart, instead of hell all the time
I'd be you
Driving her car back to her place, guess you could say I'd be you
Wreckin' her bed, stuck on her mind, she'd be still mine
I'd be you
(Yeah, I'd be you)
(Yeah)
I'd be you!
