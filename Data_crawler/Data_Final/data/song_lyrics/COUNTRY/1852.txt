Song Name: Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)
DumDeDeDum, DeDeDumDeDeDum, DeDaaDaaaaa
DumDeDeDum, DeDeDumDeDeDum, DeDaaDaaDaaDaaDaaaa
Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same
'Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling-Blinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town
And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
I'm a thourough-bred that's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high Fine as wine
Having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
What? What?
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
