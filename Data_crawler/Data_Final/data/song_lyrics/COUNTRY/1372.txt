Song Name: Waiting
Another day without you
Another midnight call
Distance ain't no friend of mine
Another lonesome highway
Another one of our songs
Nothin' gets you off my mind
But I'm waiting, yeah, I'm waiting
For you to pick up the phone
And tell me that you're coming home
Yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
So, I'm waiting
Through every storm we weather
And through every page that's torn
I guess missin' you takes its time
And every minute and mile between us
Keeps me leaning on a prayer to Jesus
Begging for the day you come back home
So, I'm waiting, yeah, I'm waiting
For you to pick up the phone
And tell me that you're coming home
Yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
So, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, yeah, I'm waiting
For you to come runnin' home
So, I can hold you in my arms
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
And I'm gonna love you until we're dead and gone
So, I'm waiting
