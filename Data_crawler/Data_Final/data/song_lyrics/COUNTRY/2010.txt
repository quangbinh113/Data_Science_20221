Song Name: Young and Stupid
Ooh, take me back to where all I needed was a Pontiac
And some Boone's Farm and three dollars in gas
And a pack of Black & Milds
Two tens in a plywood box
Styrofoam cooler in a parkin' lot
Guess you don't know what you got
Til ya been gone a while
Somethin' 'bout a pine tree on a rearview
Smells like cuttin' class in highschool
Funny how a couple years can change you
Now I only miss work when I have to
Sometimes I close my eyes and
I'm in neutral, no headlights yeah
Just tryin' to creep out the drive
Without wakin' my mama up
Ooh, take me back to where all I needed was a Pontiac
And some Boone's Farm and three dollars in gas
And a pack of Black & Milds
Two tens in a plywood box
Styrofoam cooler in a parkin' lot
I guess you don't know what you got
Til ya been gone a while
And I been gone a while
Green line on my neck from my necklace
Sunburn baby oil couldn't care less
Now I know what it cost when it costs less
Damn, botox be expensive
Ooh, take me back to where all I needed was a Pontiac
And some Boone's Farm and three dollars in gas
And a pack of Black & Milds
Two tens in a plywood box
Styrofoam cooler in a parkin' lot
I guess you don't know what you got
Til ya been gone a while
And I been gone a while
Put on that gangsta music
Tonight I'm young and stupid
Man I wish I was cruisin' down 301
Ooh, take me back to where all I needed was a Pontiac
And some Boone's Farm and three dollars in gas
And a pack of Black & Milds
Two tens in a plywood box
Styrofoam cooler in a parkin' lot
I guess you don't know what you got
Til ya been gone a while
And I been gone a while
(Tonight I'm young and stupid)
I been gone a while
(Tonight I'm young and stupid)
And I been gone a while
(Tonight I'm young and stupid)
I been gone a while
(Tonight I'm young and stupid)
