Song Name: One For My Baby
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place
Accept you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I've got a little story
You oughtta know
We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I've got the routine
So drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad
I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell you a lot
But you've gotta to be true to your coat
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away
Well that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're
Gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I found
Must be drowned
Or it soon may explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
That long, long road
