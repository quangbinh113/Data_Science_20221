Song Name: It Might as Well Be Spring
Da-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
Da-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring
Da-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Ohh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring
And I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words I've never heard before
From a man I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
Ohh, I haven't seen a rosebud or a crocus
Or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring
Da-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ta
I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking on a strange new street
Hearing words I've never heard before
From a man I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
And I haven't seen a rosebud or a crocus
Or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring
Pa-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
La-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
La-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
La-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
La-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, eeh
Wee-ru-ru, pee-tee, yu, yu, yu, oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Dee-ru-dee
Abarun-day, taburun-day, taburun-day, taburun-day, taburun-day
Ta-ra-ra, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
Ooooh, aa-oow-ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oooh
Awe, tu-ru-tee-twee, hee-ooh, hee-ooh, hee-ooh
Ooooh, aa-oo-oooh
