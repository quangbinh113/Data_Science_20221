Song Name: THATS WHAT I WANT
One, two, three, four
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, looking at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, coming over to me, yeah
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away, but
I want someone who love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothing but love on my mind (my mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down to marry"
Like, tell me, "That's life" when I'm stressing at night
Be like, "You'll be okay", and, "Everything's all right," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away, but
I want someone who love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
I want (I) someone to love me
I need (I) someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
