Song Name: Uptown Funk
This hit
That ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer
That white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces
Stylin', wiling
Livin' it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty
I'm too hot
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot
Say my name you know who I am
Too hot
I'm band 'bout that money
Break it down
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch
Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio, get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
Too hot damn
Call the police and the fireman
Too hot
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
Too hot
Say my name you know who I am
Too hot
I'm band 'bout that money
Break it down
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch
