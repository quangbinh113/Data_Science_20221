Song Name: The Doo-Bop Song
Let's kick a verse for my man called Miles
'Cause seems to me he's gonna be 'round for a long while
'Cause he's a multi-talented and gifted musician
Who can play any position
It's no mystery that you're no risk to me
'Cause I'm the lover and tell your girl to throw a kiss to me
And hop in bed and have a fight with the pillow
Turn off the lights and let the J give it to ya
And let the trumpet blow as I kick this
'Cause rap is fundamental and Miles sounds so wicked
A little taste of bebop sound with the backdrop of doo-hop
And this is why we can call it the doo-bop
Now go ahead and play like a wannabe
You know it's gonna be
I hate to cut the throats of MC's up in front of me
When I'm out blow make the A want to sing
My rhymes be shining on brothers
Like they flippin' on they high beams
And when I just come through
You think you bad 'cause somebody has seen you
Climbing the tree like Jack Be Nimble
Yo, Miles blow the trumpet off the symbol
Miles Davis style is different, you could describe it as specific
He rip, rage and roar, no time for watchin' Andy Griffith
You can (whistle) all you want, go ahead
While he take to doo-hop and mix it with bebop
Just like a maker in the shoe shop
Easy Mo Bee will cream you like the nougat
And usually we doo-wop but since Miles wanna cool out
You can do that Miles, blow your trumpet
Show the people, just when it's to doo-bop
