Song Name: After the Sun
So tell me what you want babe
'Cause I can't keep on guessing your love
Tell me what you want babe
So I can make sure you're getting enough
What can I say, your love is my medicine
Make me feel so good, make me be a better man
So take my hand and we'll go after the sun
The sand between our toes feels good
The breeze so nice let's just lie down on the shore
Let me carry you on my back, jump in the water I hope you like that
Making love, after the sun
Oh, look at what you've done to me
You got me on my knees begging for more of you
More of us, more of trust
More of everything you're willing to give
So take my hand and we'll go after the sun
The sand between our toes feels good
The breeze so nice let's just lie down on the shore
Let me carry you on my back, jump in the water I hope you like that
Making love, after the sun
So take my hand and we'll go after the sun
The sand between our toes feels good
The breeze so nice let's just lie down on the shore
Let me carry you on my back, jump in the water I hope you like that
Making love, after the sun
So take my hand and we'll go after the sun
The sand between our toes feels good
The breeze... oh
