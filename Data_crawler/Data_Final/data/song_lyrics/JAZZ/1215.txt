Song Name: Good Luck / Boa Sorte - English version
That's all it is
There is no other way
It's over
Good luck
There's not much to say
It's only words
And my feelings
Won't change
All that you want to give
It's too much, it's so heavy
There's no peace
All that you want from me
Unreal expectations, unfaithful
That's it
There's no way
It's over
Good luck
I have nothing left to say
It's only words
And what l feel
Won't change
All that you want to give (Everything you want to give)
It's too much
It's so heavy (It's too much)
There is no peace (Too heavy)
All that you want from me (There is no peace)
Unreal (All you want from me)
Expectations (Isn't real)
Unfaithful (Expectations)
Keep yourself together
Trying to get over
This person who speaks to you
We're not on the same page
Try to see it my way
There are so many special people
Now even if you hold yourself
I want you to get cure from this person
Who advices you, there is a disconnection
See through this point of view
There are so many special people in the world
So many special people in the world
In the world
All you want, all you want
All that you want to give (Everything you want to give)
It's too much
It's so heavy (It's too much)
There is no peace (Too heavy)
All that you want from me (There is no peace)
Unreal (All you want from me)
Expectations (Isn't real)
Unfaithful (Expectations)
Now were falling (falling), falling (falling) into the night (into the night)
Falling (falling), falling (falling) into the night
Now were falling (falling), falling (falling) into the night (into the night)
