Song Name: The Other Woman
Little girl, just keep on waiting
For that man to give you a life
You keep on hoping, so this prince can save you
Keep on dreaming his scandalous lie
For your love is he the hero, mmm
Does he know that you begging him please?
Where angels dare, the devils fill that need
In your despair does he get up to leave?
At the start of his goodbye
Do you ever realize
That you never get the chance?
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
"You're the other woman"
The other woman
Wear that dress, the one you rely on, mmm
Slit up high, that shows off your wares
And when he's arriving, give him that invitation
Keep on wishing almost all of him cares
For your love he is your hero, yes
Even though you are begging him please, please
Woman unscared, your risks are never ending
And don't you pretend you don't live what you breathe
At the start of his goodbye
Do you ever realize
That you never get the chance?
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
"You're the other woman"
The other woman
You'll always be the other woman
You'll always be the other woman

Baby, trust me, I've been there before
You don't know him, I know him more
At the start of his goodbye
Do you ever realize
That you never get the chance?
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
"You're the other woman"
The other woman
