Song Name: Bad Romance - Live
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
I want your love
I want your disease
I want you open-mouthed
And on your knees
I want your love
Love, love, love
I want your love

I want your drama
The touch of your hand
I want you leather-choked
Handcuffed to my hand
I want your love
Love, love, love
I want your love
I want your loving
And I want your revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
I want your loving
All your lover's revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
I want your horror
I want your desire
Make you beg
As long as you're mine
I want your love
Love, love, love
I want your love
I want your psycho
Your vertigo kiss
I want you in my bed
I'll make you sick
I want your love
Love, love, love

I want your loving
And I want your revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
I want your loving
All your lover's revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
Just dance
I want your love
And I want your revenge
I want your love
I don't wanna be friends
J'veux ton amour
Et je veux ta revanche
J'veux ton amour
I don't wanna be friends
I don't wanna be friends
I don't wanna be friends
I don't wanna be friends
No, no
I want your loving
And I want your revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
I want your loving
All your lover's revenge
You and me could
Write a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Caught in a bad romance
