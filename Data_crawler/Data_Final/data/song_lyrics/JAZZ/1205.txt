Song Name: Sick Of You
I've been away too long from you and I'm sorry
But I can't control just what you do
And I hope to god that you leave me soon
That you walk away from this
Burning bridge that you crossed too late
And you just forget that we ever met
But before you forget
There's just something I have to say
I'm sick of your voice
Sick of your face
Sick of your choices
Sick of your name
Sick of your pleasure
Sick of your pain
Sick of your pressure
Sick of your game
I wish I never ever met you
Five years of mistakes I'll never undo
I'm not your medicine or your tool
Don't expect me to ever fix you

Every little thing always seems to be about you
Exercise your criticism, then get mad when I'm through
You think your traumas don't affect a single person 'round you
I'm not your therapist or boyfriend, try and get the two confused
I'm best friends with your new boyfriend and I'll tell him every truth
I don't care if he don't like it, I don't care if he tells you
Text me that you fuckin' hate me, well it's 'bout time that you do
Get the fuck up out my life because I'm still in love with
I'm sick of your voice
Sick of your face
Sick of your choices
Sick of your name
Sick of your pleasure
Sick of your pain
Sick of your pressure
Sick of your game
Sick of your sight
Sick of your shape
Sick of your spite
I'm sick of your shade
I'm sick of your lies
Sick of your lazy
Sick of your cries
I'm sick of your crazy
I wish I never ever met you
Five years of mistakes I'll never undo
I'm not your medicine or your tool
Don't expect me to ever fix you
