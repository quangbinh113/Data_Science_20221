Song Name: Fallen
I can't believe it
You're a dream coming true
I can't believe how
I have fallen for you
And I was not looking
Was content to remain
And it's ironic
To be back in the game
You are the one
Who's led me to the sun
How could I know
That I was lost without you
And I want to tell you
You control my rain
And you should know that
You are life in my vein
You are the one
Who's led me to the sun
How could I know that
I was lost without you
Ooh, I can't believe it
You're a dream coming true
Ooh, I can't believe how
I have fallen for you
And I was not looking
Was content to remain
And it's erotic
To be back in the game
Oh-oh-oh, you're a dream coming true
Oh, my, my, my, I have fallen for you
Oh-oh-oh, you're a dream coming true
Oh, my, my, my, I have fallen for you
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh yeah, you're a dream coming true
Oh, my, my, my, I have fallen for you
