Song Name: Change (feat. Chris Yonge)
One second
I, I'm so afraid
Of going through change
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same?
I'm so afraid
Of going through change
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same?
I've been up late, there's some things we go through
Won't lie, afraid of anything that feel new
So I smoke, I drink like I got nothing to lose
I'm falling back into this hell
Tell me, what's the wait?
Call your friends and come through
I struggle every day 'cause tonight I let lose
Shots of lemonade spiked my vodka with juice
Yeah, everything's feeling so different these days
If you work this out
Keep tripping all over myself
Serve some help
Filling my mind with this doubt
But I'm trying
Running as far as I can
'Cause I know that I
I, I'm so afraid
Of going through change (Going)
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same?
I'm so afraid (So afraid, I'm so afraid)
Of going through change (Going)
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same?
I've been going through changes, sometimes it's a lot
Memories I tried saving, somehow I forgot
I don't know what I'm chasing, start to think I'm lost
Yeah, my chest's been feeling heavy
Couple shots of liquor, think I'm ready
Talk my shit, don't tempt me
I think that it's overdue
Fuck it, yeah
Life can hurt, life is pain
Then get on your feet again
Go to work, love your fam
Real life over Instagram
I get down then I learn
Okay, let these bridges burn
I'm through
I'm through, 'cause
I, I'm so afraid (Yeah, I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid)
Of going through change (Going)
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same? (Yeah)
I'm so afraid
Of going through change
Does anybody feel the same?
Does anybody feel the same?
