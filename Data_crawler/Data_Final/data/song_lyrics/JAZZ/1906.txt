Song Name: The Best Is Yet to Come (with Diana Krall)
Out of the tree of life, I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good, bet the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait 'til the warm-up's underway
Wait 'til our lips have met
Wait 'til you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine, we're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait 'til your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground
Wait 'til you're locked in my embrace
Wait 'til I draw you near
Wait 'til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come Tony, won't it be fine
Anna, the best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Wait 'til your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground
Wait 'til you're locked in my embrace
Wait 'til I draw you near
Wait 'til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
