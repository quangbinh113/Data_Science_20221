Song Name: I'm Missing U
Ohh babe...
Ohh babe...
The nights are long
My days are cold
Without the warmth you provide me when I hold
You in my arms, feels so long ago
When you were there...
I think a teardrop just fell down.
I really wanna come to see you
I really really wish I could
Maybe in a couple weeks
It's only a couple weeks...
But even know I get to
It's 14 days I gotta get trough (it's too many days babe)
And I'm really really missing you.
And I miss, miss, Miss.
I'm missing you.
And I don't know.
How I'm gonna make it trough.
But I gotta, gotta
Stay strong for us two.
I'm a man
It's a job that I gotta do.
So I go outside and I fake a smile.
But if they only knew
Just how many miles.
Were between love so true
I really couldn't cope the way that we do (that we do.)
And I'm really really missing you
You, you.
Baby when you're near
All of my visions clear.
But like a magic show
I blink and than you disapear.
And I frequently
Envision of it would be.
To have you alone with me.
Give me a moment so I can breathe .
Ok.
I really wanna come to see you
Baby I wish I could ...(Wish I could.)
Maybe in a couple weeks (It's only two weeks)
It's only a couple weeks (But the problem is.)
Even though I get to.
It's 14 long days that I don't have you. (It's too many days babe)
And I'm really really missing you.
And I miss, miss. Miss
I'm really really missing you.
And I don't know, (I don't know)
How I'm gonna make it through.
But I gotta, gotta ... (Gotta)
Stay strong for us two.
I'm a man
It's a job that I gotta do.
So I go outside and I fake a smile
But if they only knew
Just how many miles. (How many miles)
Were between love so true
I really couldn't cope the way that we do. (The way that we do)
And I'm really really missing you (Missing you)
'Cause maybe one day babe
Not too far away
We can turn, all our dreams into memories.
(Not gonna be like this forever right?)
Baby we'll have that home
Stars stares, all that we share.
Too many nights, over the phone.
I really wanna come to see you (uhuh)
Baby you know I do.
Maybe in a couple weeks (I'll try)
It's only a couple weeks (Can't promiss.)
But even know I get to
Still don't wanna be away from you.
It's too many days babe
And I'm really really missing you.
And I miss, miss, Miss.
I miss you.
And I don't know (I don't know)
How I'm gonna make it trough.
But I gotta, gotta
Hold strong for us two (strong for us two)
I'm a man
It's a job that I gotta do.
So I go outside (I'll go outside)
And I fake a smile (I'll fake a smile)
But if they only knew
Just how many miles.
Were between love so true
I really couldn't cope the way that we do.
And I'm really really missing you...
(End)
