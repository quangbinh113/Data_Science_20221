Song Name: A Man I Know
I know
I've tried to hide it
But I don't wanna hide it
Yes, I've been through hell,
And I'm still ashamed of what I am
Yes, I tried to say it
I know, I have to say it
But I'm from a place out of time
Where a man has got to be a man
I wash away my makeup
Slow, I try to wake up
I've been losing myself
Hoping I was someone else
Yes, I'd like to tell you
And try to say I love you
But I'm from a place out of time
Where a man has got to be a man
Where a man has got to be a man
Where a man has got to be a man
But it's over now
It's over now yeah
I've got all the love to give
I need someone I can't receive
