Don't feel bad
Because the sun went down
The night has wealth untold
You just keep watching
And you soon will see
The moon is made of gold
And now the stars appear
And as they do
All heaven they unfold
Don't feel bad
Because the sun went down
The moon is made of gold
* (Oh you) See how the shadows
Enhanced by the light above
Dance in the night
As the breeze sigh
Soon you will be asleep
Into your dreams will creep
Visions of fairies
Flyin' through the sky
And one by one
Your dreams will all come true
Magic you behold
Don't feel bad
Because the sun went down
The moon is made of gold
(* repeat)
The night is magic
And the moon is made of gold
