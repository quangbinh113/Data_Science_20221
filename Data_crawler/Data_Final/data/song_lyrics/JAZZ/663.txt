Song Name: Let's Stay Together
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my life with you
Let me say that since, mm
Since we've been together, oh
Loving you forever
That's what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh, baby, let's
Let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's
Let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Good or bad, happy or sad
Good or bad, happy or sad
