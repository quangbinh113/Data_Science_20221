Song Name: Help Me
You got to help me
I can't do it all by myself
You got to help me, baby
I can't do it all by myself
You know if you don't help me darling
I'll have to find myself somebody else
I may have to wash
May have to sew
I may have to cook
I might mop the floor but you help me babe
You know if you don't help me darling
I'll find myself somebody else
When I walk, you walk with me
When I talk, you talk to me
Oh baby, I can't do it all by myself
You know if you don't help me darling I'll have to
Find myself somebody else
Help me, help me darlin'
Bring my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Oh, bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Darlin' I know we stripped bare
But I don't feel like lying down
Oh yeah
