Song Name: Catch Me If You Can (Fly Away)
Packing away
To place I've never been
Goodbye to my friends
There's no coming back
About to begin
New life and new me
Excitement and fear
Don't know what I feel
Confused and unclear
My future ahead
Now where do I go
My head's in the clouds
Journey is ahead
From Tokyo to LA
To Paris to wherever you lead me
No planning but instead
Just name the place and go
Today we mark the first page of our life
Let's fly fly away
Leave worries and mistakes behind you
Fly fly away
Just take my hand, you'll never be alone
We've never met
I don't speak your word
We're nothing alike
But now we are friends
Two worlds collided
You're my only northern star
Journey is ahead
From Tokyo to LA
To Paris to wherever you lead me
No planning but instead
Just name the place and go
Today we mark the first page of our life
Let's fly fly away
Leave worries and mistakes behind you
Fly fly away
Just take my hand, you'll never be alone
Let's fly fly away
Let's fly fly away
Let's fly fly away
Leave worries and mistakes behind you
Fly fly away
Just take my hand, you'll never be alone (let's fly fly away)
Things that I adore
It's hard to leave behind
Don't ever stop
Keep moving on your way (let's fly fly away)
Long and rainy days
Above the clouds we go
Ceaseless sun is shining bright above (let's fly fly away)
Journey is ahead
From Tokyo to LA
To Paris to wherever you lead me (let's fly fly away)
No planning but instead
Just name the place and go
Today we mark the first page of our life
Let's fly fly away
That's what we got to do
Let's fly fly away
No oh
