Song Name: Anywhere Anything
La, la, la, la, la, la
I see her smile through the curtains, waiting
I'm sitting here in my car
It's been so long since I've felt this strongly about anything
About anyone
I see her locking the door
So daintily, she turns and waves from afar
She makes her way down the driveway
Smiling, I lean over, open her door
I sit and wait 'til her seatbelt's on
I hit the gas and we're gone
I tell her, "I've no idea where we're going."
She laughs. That's all
I'll go anywhere
I'll do anything
'Long as it's with you, long as I'm with you
Know it could be the smallest thing
If you give me a ring
I'll always answer your call
Make it a point, I'll always be prepared
Where ever you are, love, I'll be there
'Cause I'll go anywhere and I'll do anything with you
She knows park and it's not too far
Parking is free in the lot
Well she said she'd play here when she was younger
I'm glad she shares all her thoughts
But I'm not as social as most, but she helps me
Asking me all 'bout my past
So I, I tell her, "I've never spoken so freely."
"You made me better at that."
We watch the sun as it sets, it's freezing
I offer my coat, she doesn't want it, though
Hop in the car and she cranks my heater
She laughs. That's all
It's getting late as I walk her to her door
She bites her lip, touches my face, smiles as she closes the door
We've never kissed, believe me, there's no rush
I'd have waited forever for that one touch
And I'd go anywhere and I'd do anything with you
