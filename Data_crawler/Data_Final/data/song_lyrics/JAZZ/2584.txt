Song Name: Billie's Blues - Take 1
Lord, I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue
My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go
Some men like me coarse and happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money
Some tell me, "Baby, you're built for speed"
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs
