Song Name: 'Round Midnight
When the day has turned to evening, to evening
And the stars come out to show their magic
That's the time you'll feel so lonesome
It's so strange and it's blue at midnight
Where are those whose dreams are shattered? Are shattered?
Some who search in vain for long lost romance
Some who walk the city canyons
Hoping they'll get one more chance
When your life seems it's not worth living
And your world seems it's unforgiving
I have found traveling around
It's often been told, "don't lose your soul"
There may be a new tomorrow, baby
I hope you find a love to hold you spellbound
Then you will be oh so happy
When old midnight comes around
I cannot tell you what is luck
To have someone that you could really love
A good man that you can call your own
To call your heart and soul
And so round midnight is my time to plead
