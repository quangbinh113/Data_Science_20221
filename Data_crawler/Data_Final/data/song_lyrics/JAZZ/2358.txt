Song Name: Dancing on the Ceiling
She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up there above
I whisper, go away, my lover
Its not fair
But Im so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love
I whisper, go away, my lover
Its not fair
But Im so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love
