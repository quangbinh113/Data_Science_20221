Song Name: 12th Avenue
On a blue and brilliant morning
I agreed to come your way
You have asked to meet me a week or two before
But I was shy and had to hide away
But on a certain morning things were different
You gave me directions, so I could find my way
"It's down the street then take a left, then right, then left again
Find 1 11 and you'll be on your way"
I saw you there, by the stairs
Searching for somewhere to look
And I caught your eye, you caught mine
It seems one glance was all it took
And I could count the many things that I love about you
But it would take all day
And I could spend so many hours of the night
Just thinking of that faithful look
Knowing it's my heart you took
And so it seems, I'm living a dream
But when I wake up, you're still here
So to this day, with you I'll stay
It seems one glance made everything clear
I could count the many things that I love about you
But it would take all day
And I could spend so many hours of the night
Just thinking of that faithful look
Knowing it's my heart you took
And so it seems, I am living a dream
But when I wake up, you're still here
So to this day, with you I'll stay
It seems one glance made everything clear
Clear
