I'm like "Bitch, who is your man's?", ayy
Can't keep my dick in my pants, ayy
My bitch don't love me no more, ayy
She kick me out I'm like "Vro", ayy
That bitch don't wanna be friends, ayy
I gave her dick, she amen, ayy
She put her tongue on my dick, ayy
Look at my wrist, about ten, ayy
Just got a pound of that boof, ayy
Brought that shit straight to the booth, ayy

She said, "Wan' fuck?", bitch, I do, ayy
You put a gun on my mans, ayy
I put a hole in your parents, ayy
I just got lean on my Ksubis, ayy

I took a white bitch to Starbucks
That lil' bitch got her throat fucked
I like to rock out, I'm misfit
My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yeah, ayy
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yeah
