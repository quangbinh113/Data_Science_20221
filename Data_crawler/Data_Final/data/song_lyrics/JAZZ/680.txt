Song Name: Save a Little Love for Me
Mornings took away my baby
Leaving me with shame
While you're out lingering the streets
I'm forced to wait here
My heart is in chains
Can you save a little love for me?
Days became an expectation
Driving me insane
What you're doing while you're out there
Has anyone else managed to restrain
Better save a little love for me
It's night around but you can see me
I see you all the time
When the sun comes up you're running
As if you committed a crime
And I cry save a little love for me
When you put your arms around me
I forget the pain
Tell me are you thinking of me
Does my arms making you feel the same
Just save a little love for me
You go and you come
Come and you go
What can I do to make you know
That sweet is my lovely
Here and you there
Then you here
What can I say to make you not feel
Love is all I'm asking you to be
Mornings took away my baby
Leaving me with shame
While you're out lingering the streets
I'm forced to wait here
My heart is in pain
Please save a little love for me
Only at nights
When no one is awake to see
You take off the mask that's in yourself
Be closer to my sweet melody
You turn and ask "save a little love for me"
You go and you come
Come and you go
What can I do to make you know
That sweet is my lovely
Here and you there
Then you here
What can I say to make you not feel
Love is all I'm asking you to be
