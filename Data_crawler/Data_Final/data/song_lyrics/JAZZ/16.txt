Song Name: Regent's Park
I must have sent four hundred poems
On the way you used to smile at me
I used to write 'em for you daily
But my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song
About the bitch that broke my heart
I should've listened to my mama
She saw through you from the start
But now we're here in Regent's park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day
It was a place not too dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I should have found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me
How expensive you would be
I lost more than money, dear
You knocked the swagger out of me
But now we're here in Regent's park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
(Make you change your mind)
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day
