Song Name: Save Me
Save me, somebody save me
Save me, somebody save me
I promised myself after the last romance
That I wouldn't give ya a second chance
They say to you seek, you're sure to find
And I know how sure that is
'Cause the closer I get to ya, baby
You're driving me clean out of my mind
I say save me
Somebody save me
Anybody save me
If somebody save me
Those who love always give the most
We're cryin' together from coast to coast
'Cause love makes me cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours unjustified
Beggin' ya to save me
Good lord
Somebody save me
Those who love always give the most
We're cryin' together from coast to coast
'Cause love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours unjustified
Your never said ya needed me
You abused my love, to set me free
You didn't need me, you didn't even want me
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me
Calling the Cape Crusader, Green Hornet, Batman, Kadoo too, anybody
I'm in so much trouble, I don't know what to do yeah
If you're thinkin' a thing about me
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
Please now
Please now
Please now
Please now
Oh just save me
Wow
Hey, save me
