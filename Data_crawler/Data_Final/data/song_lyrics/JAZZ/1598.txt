Song Name: Send In The Clowns
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Just when I'd stopped
Opening doors
Finally knowing the one
That I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
Where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here
Isn't it rich?
And isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year
Mhm
Maybe next year
