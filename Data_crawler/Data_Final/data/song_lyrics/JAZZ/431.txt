Song Name: Build a Bitch
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (yeah)
Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lot of parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (one, two, three, ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
The boys are always playing dolls
Looking for their Barbie
They don't look like Ken at all
Hardly have a heartbeat
Need someone who falls apart
So he can play Prince Charming
If that's the kind of girl he wants
Then he forgot
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (one, two, three)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
