Song Name: Crazy in Love
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame, yeah
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy in love
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't here, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I know
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you save me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy in love
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy in love
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no no
