Song Name: I Love Paris
I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
See, I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
See, I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why, oh, why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near
See, I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
See, I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
Yes, I love Paris, why, oh, why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near
Because my love is near
Because my love is near
Because my love is near
