Song Name: Surrender - Martin Jensen Remix
We let the waters rise
We drifted to survive
I needed you to stay
But I let you drift away
My love, where are you?
My love, where are you?
Whenever you're ready, can we surrender?
Whenever you're ready, can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
I surrender
I surrender
No one will win this time
I just want you back
I'm running to your side
Flying my white flag, my white flag
Whenever you're ready, can we surrender?
Whenever you're ready, can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
Can we surrender?
I surrender
I surrender
Can we surrender?
I surrender
