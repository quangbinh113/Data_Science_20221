Song Name: Little Black Train
That little black train is coming
Get all of your business right
You better set your house in order
Or the train may be here tonight
God spoke to Hezekiah
In a message from on high
You better set your house in order
For thou must surely die
That little black train is coming
Get all of your business right
You better set your house in order
Or the train may be here tonight
He turned his face to the wall
To see the king and tell
He got his business fixed alright
And God spared him 15 years
That little black train is coming
Get all of your business right
You better set your house in order
Or the train may be here tonight
Listen men and listen women
They care nothing for the gospel life
'Til that bell rang and the whistle blew
Oh that little black train in sight
That little black train is coming
Get all of your business right
You better set your house in order
Or the train may be here tonight
You better set your house in order
Or the train may be here tonight
