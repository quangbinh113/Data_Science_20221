Song Name: There Will Never Be Another You
This is our last dance together,
Tonight soon will be long ago.
And in our moment of parting,
This is all I want you to know...
There will be many other nights like this,
And I'll be standing here with someone new.
Another fall... another spring...
But there will never be another you.
There will be other lips that I may kiss,
But they won't thrill me,
Like yours used to do.
Yes, I may dream a million dreams,
But how can they come true,
If there will never, ever be another you?
Interlude Yes, I may dream a million dreams,
But how can they come true,
If there will never, ever be...
Another you?
