Song Name: Loretta
Loretta, I see you walking now and then
Loretta, I see you coming near
Why's it oh so hard to turn back and finally whisper?
How are we supposed to carry on?
Well, I've got to for now
Forget her, and everything she said, she lied
I met her, morning noon and night
Well, I'd say I fooled ya
So, Loretta, you never won the fight
Why's it oh so hard to turn back and finally whisper?
How are we supposed to carry on?
Well, I've got to for now
(Loretta, I've got to)
(Loretta, I've got to)
(Loretta, I've got to)
(Loretta)
