Song Name: You're My Window To The Sky
I was runnin' for the hills
I knew no more about today
Thinking backwards, thinking forth
Either way not much to say
Isolation's quite a way to deal with this mess
Fallin' at my feet, I knew my time was gone and I was alone
Sick thinkin' of me
What can I do for you and what do you want?
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky and I'm thankful for you today
You're my window to the sky and when you laugh I feel okay
It's fallin' down, I thought I had it all wrapped up inside my head
But I was rearrangin' thoughts for other's eyes instead
Fallin' at my feet, I knew my time was gone and I was alone
I'm sick thinkin' of me
What can I do for you and what do you want?
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky-y-y-y-y-y
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky and I'm thankful for you today
You're my window to the sky
You're my window to the sky-y-y-y-y-y
Fallin' at my feet, I knew my time was gone and I was alone
