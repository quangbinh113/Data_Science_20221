Song Name: Close to my fire
Aaw... aaaw...
Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and my flames gettin' higher
You light me up, sweet 'ole desire
So won't you come, close to my fire
Yeah yeah - Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah - yeah yeah
(VERSE:)
Baby it's cold
When you're gone
Don't make me wait
Wait too long
Whenever you're near
I'm high on this fever
You're making me weak
Oh I'm a believer
So
Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and my flames gettin' higher
You light me up, sweet 'ole desire
So won't you come, close to my fire
Yeah yeah - Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah - yeah yeah
(VERSE:)
Boy you are my
Tempting delusion
You're meltin' it down
My resolution
I can't escape
Can't say I'm trying
You say my name
... oh I can't hide it
So come on sugar
Don't slow it down
I won't stop craving
'Til you come around
You can't deny it
You're right here at home
The embers are waitin'
You know I want you to
Ain't no need to tell me boy
Ain't no need to tell me boy
Because I know
