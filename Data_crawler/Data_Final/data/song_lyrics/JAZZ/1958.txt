Song Name: Hello, Dolly!
Hello, Dolly
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You still glowin', you still crowin', you're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly, never go away again
I feel the room swayin'
While the band' playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
Golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly, never go away
Fivers, you'll never go away
Dolly, never go away again
