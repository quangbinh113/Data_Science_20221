Song Name: Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
I thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling, I guess that my mind's more at ease
Oh, nevertheless, why stir up memories?
I've been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling, I guess, my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?
Been invited on dates
I might've gone, but what for?
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
Oh baby, don't get around much anymore
