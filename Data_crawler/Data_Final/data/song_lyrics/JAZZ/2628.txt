Song Name: I Think It's Going to Rain Today
Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen faces to keep love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
Tin can at my feet
I think I'll kick it down the street
Why not?
That's the way to treat a friend
Bright before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
I hope it's gonna rain today, yeah
I hope it's gonna rain today, yeah
I think it's going to rain today, yeah
