Song Name: Old Devil Moon
I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I just wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love
I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I just wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love
