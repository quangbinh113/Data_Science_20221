Song Name: Material Girl
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think theyre o.k.
If they dont give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they cant see the light
Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always mister right, cause we are
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
A material girl
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
Thats all right with me
If they cant raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie but
I dont let them play
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day, cause they are
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
A material girl
Boys may come and boys may go
And thats all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now theyre after me, cause everybodys
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
A material girl
