Song Name: Lumi√©re
Sing to yourself
Melodies then wonder around
Throw in some words
Do you like how they sound
You've got a song
Songs can be 'bout anything, and
Some songs don't mean anything, just
Pour your heart out
Wear it on your sleeves
Cause you've got a song
Take a deep breath
There's no need to worry yourself
You'll take your steps
On foot at a time
Like everyone else
Some folks like to
Chase the sun, the
Thrill if they could
Time out run and
Some would rather slowly soak it up
So, walk as you must.
