Song Name: Wonderful Tonight (with Ivan Lins)
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her makeup
And brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
A noite é de festa
E ela veste o luar
Me arrasta e me testa
Se sente uma superstar
E então pergunta
Se eu estou em paz
E eu digo sim
I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you
De volta para casa
Cansados de festejar (de festejar)
Me deita, me abraça
Me beija, não quer falar
And then I tell her
As I turn off the lights
Darling, estavas linda até demais
I say, "My darling, you look wonderful tonight"
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight"
