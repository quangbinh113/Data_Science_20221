Song Name: Lover, Come Back To Me
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
I remember every little thing you used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I feel lonely
The sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
I remember every little thing you used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I feel lonely
The sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Oh lover, oh lover
Come back to me
