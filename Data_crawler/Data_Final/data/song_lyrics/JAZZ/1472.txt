Song Name: Jell-O
Somewhere on the scene
It got a little longer, so it seems
I burned out, so to speak
Now come a little closer
I feel a little lie in the lie track
I felt a bit of bad, but I came back
There's still a little light in the light crack
Still a bit of good (so good)
And I know just what to say (to y-o-you)
And I know just what to do (do you 2?)
And I'm so sick of playing (are you too?)
But it's hard to quit when you
Losing this game, I can't afford to be losing this game
(And I know you're the safest bet)
Losing my mind, can't find the words, no, I can't seem to find
(What I'm really trying to get)
Reason, rhyme, let's take our time and choose
(Whether we green or yellow)
(Whether we deep or shallow)
Please me now 'cause we're about to lose
(Whether we Bye or Hello)
(Whether we stiff or jell-o)
Sometimes when you're mean
You pour a little bit of gasoline
I burned out, so to speak
Now come a little closer
Here is my disclosure
Do you mind to quit you're pretending
Truth or false, this shit's never-ending
Hear me now and stop condescending
You see I'm beggin', you hear me banging
If you seek for love don't try to hide it
Find it deep inside and try to ride it
If there's a way I wanna know we tried it
Quit your games and now don't you deny that
Losing this game, I can't afford to be losing this game
(And I know you're the safest bet)
Losing my mind, can't find the words, no, I can't seem to find
(What I'm really trying to get)
Reason, rhyme, let's take our time and choose
(Whether we green or yellow)
(Whether we deep or shallow)
Please me now cause we're about to lose
(Whether we Bye or Hello)
(Whether we stiff or jell-o)
I gotta move and make amends
But can't go through the same regrets
It could feel so good, oh my
(Light up our love again, high gain, again, again)
(And I know you're the safest bet)
(What I'm really trying to get)
Reason, rhyme, let's take our time and choose
(Whether we green or yellow)
(Whether we deep or shallow)
Please me now cause we're about to lose
(Whether we Bye" or Hello)
(Whether we stiff or jell-o)
