Song Name: September Song - Guitar Acoustic
Our love was stronger than lightning
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron, you and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning, you and I
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating
You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers, you and I
Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating
You were my September song, summer lasted too long (ooh ooh)
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone? (Ooh ooh)
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
I hear that September song and I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody
And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my
(September song)
You are my
(September song)
Wooh
You were my September song (September), summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly (remember) when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song
I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
