Song Name: It's A Lovely Day Today
It's a lovely day today
So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
And I hope whatever you've got to do
It's somethin' that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay
It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doin' it with you
But if you've got somethin' that must be done
An' it can only be done by one
There is nothin' more to say
Except it's a lovely day for sayin', it's a lovely day
It's a lovely day today
So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
And I hope whatever you've got to do
It's somethin' that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay
It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doin' it with you
But if you've got somethin' that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothin' more to say
Except it's a lovely day for sayin', it's a lovely day
But if you've got somethin' that must be done
An' it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for sayin'
What a lovely day for sayin'
It's a lovely day for sayin'
It's a lovely day
