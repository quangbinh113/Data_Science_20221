Song Name: August Diaries
I tried to keep a diary
To let it out away from me
Maybe
I should've burned your memory
Instead I let it ruin me
You see
Watching the moon I feel its pain
Idyllic but cold inside
Eating my soul you're shattering, I love you boy
You were my sin so hard to hide
But I'll promise than from now on
You're gone
It's been a while since you and me
Have shared a real memory
You see
I feel the need, quietly
To have you here close to me
Maybe
Watching the moon I feel its pain
Idyllic but cold inside
Eating my soul you're shattering, I love you boy
You were my sin so hard to hide
But I'll promise that from now on
You're gone
All I remember
Cold like December
She cries on the sofa
Still wating for him to call her
But she shouldn't notice
It was only August
The cold that she felt wasn't from the weather
Was from his poison
