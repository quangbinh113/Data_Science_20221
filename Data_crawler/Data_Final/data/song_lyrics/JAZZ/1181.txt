Song Name: To Let Myself Go
To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
A step back for me
A step back for me
To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
Back for me
To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
