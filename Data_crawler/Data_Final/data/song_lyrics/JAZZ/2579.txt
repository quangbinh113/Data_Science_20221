Song Name: Any Old Time
Any old time you want me I am yours
For just the asking darling
Any old time you need me I'll be there
With love that's lasting darling
All through the years we'll stand together
Sharing the tears and stormy weather
And the sunshine
Will be yours and mine
Any old time your blue you'll have our love
To chase away the blues
And any old thing you do
I'll see you through
So just remember that I am waiting dear
If ever you want me I'll be here
Any old time and any place
Where you may be
