Song Name: Love Me, Love Me
Love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, yeah
Say it, say it, say it, say it, make me feel it, oh yeah
Love me hard, don't stop 'til I believe it, yeah
So love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, oh yeah
You don't have to go back home, stay for a little bit
I might need more, this time's bigger than the one before
What you do without it? (What you do without it?)
One more time, we call in sick and then I make you mine
This time it's different, I can't lie
I need you around me (I need you around me)
Baby, do you feel me getting closer to your chin?
C'mon and up and kiss me 'cause I know that you know better
It's not because I know me, I'm doing well since you're here
Let's make it last forever, baby
No, I won't say no
'Cause I don't know how to hold me
Now you're never on me
We can take it slow, slow
Love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, yeah
Say it, say it, say it, say it, make me feel it, oh yeah
Love me hard, don't stop 'til I believe it, yeah
So love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, oh yeah
You don't have to go back home, stay for a little bit
I might need more, this time's bigger than the one before
What you do without it? (What you do without it?)
One more time, we call in sick and then I make you mine
This time it's different, I can't lie
I need you around me (I need you around me)
Lock you up, we both ain't going out (going out)
Foreplay, our clothes are coming off (coming off)
Never thought you'd got me so in love
Like ooh-oh, tell me
What you want? Yeah, yeah, let's get it up (get it up)
No way, oh way, we load the gun (we load the gun)
Never ever, no, I never ever get enough
Like ooh-oh, baby
There's nothing to be afraid of (there's nothing to be afraid of)
Let's make tonight we stay up, so (tonight we stay up)
Love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it, yeah (like you mean it)
Say it, say it, say it, say it, make me feel it, oh yeah
Love me hard, don't stop 'til I believe it, yeah
So love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, oh yeah
You don't have to go back home, stay for a little bit
I might need more, this time's bigger than the one before
What you do without it?
