Song Name: Make Up Your Mind
Lady, I'ma be real witchya
I ain't gonna act like it's all okay
'Cause I don't know how to feel witchya
You say you wanna go but you went upstairs
So why do I even deal witchya?
Don't know if I should call or just give you space
Do I share another meal witchya
But I ain't gonna lie, girl, I miss your face, and I know
I can't keep on asking questions
I can't keep on wondering why
You kept me running in circles
And losing sleep at night, I
I want you all for myself
Don't care about no one else
I'm willing to hold you down, but
How can I give you the best of me
When you drain my energy?
Girl, you can't keep coming back
And wasting my time
One day you tell me how you feel
Then you go and disappear
Don't know what you want
So can you make up your mind?
Can you make up your mind?
Girl, can you make up your mind?
Going outta my way for ya
Staying on the phone when you're not okay
I be switching my days for ya
I opened up my home when you needed space
And be staying up late for ya
And when you all alone, I be on my way
I would even go and pray for ya
But I ain't gonna lie, you been acting strange, so I know
I can't keep on asking questions
I can't keep on wondering why
You kept me running in circles
And losing sleep at night, I
I want you all for myself
Don't care about no one else
I'm willing to hold you down, but
How can I give you the best of me
When you drain my energy?
Girl, you can't keep coming back
And wasting my time
One day you tell me how you feel
Then you go and disappear
Don't know what you want
So can you make up your mind?
How can I give you the best of me
When you drain my energy?
Girl, you can't keep coming back
And wasting my time
One day you tell me how you feel
Then you go and disappear
Don't know what you want
So can you make up your mind?
Can you make up your mind?
Girl, can you make up your mind?
