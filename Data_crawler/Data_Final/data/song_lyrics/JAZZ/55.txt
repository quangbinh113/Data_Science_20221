Song Name: Be Mine Pls
If I could see you shine one more time

That would make my night
If I told you were beautiful
Would that be alright
I'll see you in that fine dress you wear
Can't help myself but stare
Cuz when I see you girl my minds at ease
So won't cha won't cha be mine please
Be mine please
Be mine please
Be my baby
We've been talking for some time now
How I got you girl, I don't know how
There's so much I want to say to you
And you still have no clue
I tend to say a lot of things wrong
But hopefully you'll understand with this song
Every time I see you girl
I'm in love
So be mine please
Be mine please
Be my baby
I'll be the one to hold you down
I promise you i'll always be around
Baby girl, you're all i need
Even in a crowded room
You're all I see
I don't want nobody else
Just to you to myself
So baby, baby please
(Oh) Be mine please
Be mine please
Be my baby
