Baby, me tire for this your matter
E don dey give me headache oh
E be like say we go take break oh, break oh
Enough of your promises
You say you go make it up to me
But you keep getting worse o, worse o
When was the last time you carry me go cinema to see a movie
You don take this thing like play o, play o
And when last you tell me to bend over
Make you jam the thing enter
I guess you're giving it to someone else
If you no give me quality attention, oh yeah
(Attention, if you no give me quality attention)
I might get it from somebody else
('Body else, I might get it from somebody else)
If you no give me quality attention
(Attention, if you no give me quality attention)
I might get it from somebody else
(Body else, I might get it from somebody else)

Before na you dey do the caring, calling, texting, chatting
Now na me dey do the things that you used to do
We no longer need to hold on, pick two, last card, check up
Baby, I don't discuss games we used to play
Something is missing, something is missing
And I can't seem to find it, no, no, no, no, no
Something is missing, something is missing
And you better fix it before you make a sister change
If you no give me quality attention, oh yeah
(Attention, if you no give me quality attention)
I might get it from somebody else
('Body else, I might get it from somebody else)
If you no give me quality attention
(Attention, if you no give me quality attention)
I might get it from somebody else
('Body else, I might get it from somebody else)
