Song Name: Dream
I've been expecting you, think it's time to roll
Waiting away from you, baby I wanna know
I was real gone, you spun me around
Had a dream it wasn't new, had a dream it wasn't new
I learned from fire, I believed I was alone
Had a dream it wasn't new, had a dream it wasn't new
The writer's insane, the hit single never came
Had a dream it wasn't new, had a dream it wasn't new
The keyboard's upstairs, only dust is sitting there
Had a dream it wasn't new, had a dream it wasn't new
I've been expecting you, think it's time to roll
Waiting away from you, baby I wanna know
Now cut it out and see in front of you
There the single came out of the blue
I've been expecting you, think it's time to roll
Waiting away from you, baby I wanna know
I've been expecting you, think it's time to roll
Waiting away from you, baby I wanna know
The writer's insane, the writer's insane
The writer's insane, the hit single never came
The writer's insane, the writer's insane
The writer's insane, the hit single never came
The writer's insane, the writer's insane
The writer's insane, the hit single never came
The writer's insane, the writer's insane
The writer's insane, the hit single never came
