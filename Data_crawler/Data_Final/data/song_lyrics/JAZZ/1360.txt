Song Name: Darn That Dream - Live At The Tiffany Club, Los Angeles, CA., 1954
I'm making believe that you're in my arms
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe, I'm talking to you
Wish, you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So 'til my dreams come true
I'll whisper goodnight
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
I'm making believe that you're in my arms
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe, I'm talking to you
Wish, you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So 'til my dreams come true
I'll whisper goodnight
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So 'til my dreams come true
I'll whisper goodnight
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
