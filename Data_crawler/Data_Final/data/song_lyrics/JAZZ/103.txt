Song Name: I Want You
I've been oversleeping so much
That I've been bored of dreaming
And just wake up not next to you
In this paper town where I live
Boxes pass along and I wish
That I was sitting in one with you
With you
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you
You've been overthinking so much
The traffic in your head, oh, they rush
At the thought of someone new
Lauren, why can't you accept it?
I love you and I'm not pretending
When I say those words to you, yeah
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you
If I learn to love myself
Will it keep you from loving someone else?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If learning to love would cost my life
I'd spend it all on you and I
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you
