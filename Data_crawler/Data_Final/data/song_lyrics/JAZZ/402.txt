Song Name: Dancing in My Room
Na-na-na-na-na-na, yeah
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Damn, Aidan
What you up to bro?
What you been up to Aidan?
Yeah, ya
I been dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
Dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
And baby yeah, you give me reasons
Just to fight all of my demons
Yeah I love you when you're speaking
'Cause you silence all my feelings
That feeling that I'm not okay
And everyone will run away
And lеave me in my room (room)
Alone for just anothеr day
I'm sippin' on some lemonade
I wonder if you'll ever change
Fuck it, I don't even care
Baby just don't run my way
Dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
I been dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
Dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
She's a very pretty girl
In a very shitty world
She got records on the wall
And a necklace made of pearls
She's an angel to my nightmares
Message to my night scares
Whenever you are down
Just know that I'll be right there
Dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
Dancing in my room
Swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue
You're the one that I need
