Song Name: Heaven
Love's my religion
But he was my faith
Something so sacred
So hard to replace
Falling for him was like falling from grace
All wrapped in one
He was so many sins
Would have done anything
Everything for him
And if you ask me
I would do it again
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
You don't realise the power they have
Until they leave you
And you want them back
Nothing in this world
Prepares you for that
I'm not a sinner
He wasn't the one
Had no idea what we would become
There's no regrets
I just thought it was fun
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
I still remember the moment we met
The touch that he planted
The garden he left
I guess the rain was just half that effect
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say all good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
