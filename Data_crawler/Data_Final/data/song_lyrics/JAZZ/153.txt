Song Name: vulnerable
You see me like nobody's ever seen me before (before)
You see me as I'm stumbling my way through the door (through the door)
This liquor got me floating on some other plane (plane)
The room spinning around but you're my gravity (gravity)
I'm saying words that I shouldn't say out loud
And in your eyes, all the lights look like stars
I want that high while my drink's spilling love
But you cut me open, and I'm bleeding out
Baby, I'm falling into pieces in front of you (in front of you)
My baby, he sees me so vulnerable
So vulnerable
And I'm wasted (I'm wasted)
Spilling my secrets (secrets)
Baby, I'm crying in this club but I won't lie to you
I'm falling so hard with no parachute
So vulnerable, so vulnerable
Don't expect to see you here, it's not your typical crowd (crowd)
And if you see me on the street tomorrow, don't bring this up (this up)
And it's so pathetic the way that I am
Can't help but feel I lost the only chance I had
What do you think about me, think about me now? (Me now)
Me now
I'm saying words that I shouldn't say out loud (say out loud)
And in your eyes, all the lights look like stars (like stars)
I want that high while my drink's spilling love
But you cut me open, and I'm bleeding out
Baby, I'm falling into pieces in front of you (in front of you)
My baby, he sees me so vulnerable
So vulnerable
And I'm wasted (I'm wasted)
Spilling my secrets (secrets)
Baby, I'm crying in this club but I won't lie to you (I won't lie to you)
I'm falling so hard with no parachute
So vulnerable (so vulnerable)
So vulnerable
Kinda told him that I loved him in the haze
Tried to take it back but it was way too late
I'll never forget the look of pity on his face
Oh, I've been feeling so vulnerable
Yeah, I've been feeling so vulnerable
Oh, I've been feeling so vulnerable
Yeah, I've been feeling so vulnerable
