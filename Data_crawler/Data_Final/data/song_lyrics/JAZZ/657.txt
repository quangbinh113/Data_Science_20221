Song Name: At My Worst (feat. Kehlani)
Can I call you baby?
Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Will you trust I'm honest, when they're telling lies?
Can you see what I'm not saying from my eyes?
All I know is love, for you, it's real
It's different from anything that I thought I'd feel
Oh-oh, oh, don't you worry, I'll be there whenever you want me
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
