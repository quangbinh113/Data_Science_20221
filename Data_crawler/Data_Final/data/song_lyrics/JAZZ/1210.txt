Song Name: Do You Feel It Now?
How do you look at me when I'm just curled up here on the floor?
The coffee spilled and I can't clean it, so I'm locking the door
I'm sorry, I'm no good at this conversation
I tell myself I won't always keep you waiting
How can you look at this mess and still want to be by my side?
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it now?
How do you stay with me when everybody knows I'm a storm
I'm just so frozen that I do what I can do to keep warm
I know sometimes I drink too much to escape it
I fucked it up, but I'm trying to erase it
What keeps you picking up the pieces of me night after night?
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it?
(Do you feel it? Now do you feel it?)
(Do you feel it? Now do you feel it?)
(Do you feel it? Now do you feel it?)
(Do you feel it? Now do you feel it?)
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Crazy is calling, now do you feel it?
Tell me do you feel it now?
Tell me do you feel it now?
Tell me do you feel it now?
