Song Name: There's Little Left
There's little left to sing that's not been sung
No new words to rest on this tongue
There's little left to do that's not been done
There's little left to love, only one
But when it seems the world has lost it's spin
There's always your heart left to win
And there's little left to lose that's not been lost
When Jack last came to freeze, the world was frost
And there's little time to sit and stare at all
Not in winter, spring or summer or fall
But when it seems the world has lost it's spin
There's always your heart left to win
And the sun forgot to rise this morning
The moon was still aglow at dawn
But I'll never be cold or lonely
With your heart to keep me warm
And there's little left to do that's not been done
There's little left to love, only one
But when it seems the world has lost it's spin
There's always your heart left
There's always your heart left to win
