Song Name: I Should Care
Should care
I should go without sleeping
Should care
I should go around weeping
Strangly enough I sleep well
Except for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how she can let you to sleep
I should care
I should let it upset me
Should care
But it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But should care
And I do
I should care
But it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But should care
And I do
