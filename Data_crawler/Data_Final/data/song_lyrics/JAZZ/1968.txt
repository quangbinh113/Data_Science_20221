Song Name: One of Those Songs
Well, this is one of those songs that you hear now and then,
You don't know just where and you don't know just when.
It's one of those songs that are over and then,
It's one of those songs that start playin' again.
Yes, it's just one of those songs that you hear for awhile.
That comes into fashion then goes out of style.
It's one of those songs that you think you forgot,
But it's one of those songs you cannot.
Hey!
Because it's one of those songs that can make you recall a ride in the spring time a walk in the fall,
A day in the country, a night on the town, the sun coming up or the rain coming down or else the evening you parted
The morning you met, the love of your life you can never forget the reason is simple the memory belongs to one of those wonderful songs
Because it's one of those songs that's so easy to hear
You listen just once then you play it by ear
It's hummed on Veranda's it's strummed on Guitars
It's all you remember is "la da da da but later on you recall it's sung by the year You may start to smile you may shed a tear You find that one part of your life time belongs to one of those wonderful songs, to one of those wonderful songs, to one of those wonderful songs
