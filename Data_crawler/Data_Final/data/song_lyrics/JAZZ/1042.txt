Song Name: Back to Beginning
Here we go again
Back to beginning
Another day, still the same feeling
We're bigger and stronger than prisons
Take another way and try to find your reasons
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Here we go again
Back to beginning
Another day, still the same feeling
We're bigger and stronger than prisons
Take another way and try to find your reasons
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Here we go again
Back to beginning
Another day, still the same feeling
We're bigger and stronger than prisons
Take another way and try to find your reasons
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
Jumping on the cloud
Singing for the dawn
Ripping all your laws
Cleaning all your thougths
Here we go again
