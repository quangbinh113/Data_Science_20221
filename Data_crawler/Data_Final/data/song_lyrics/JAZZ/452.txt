Song Name: Needed You
I could count them if I want to
All these years I've wasted on you
You gave up, I grew up
Oh, I can't help, but wonder
Where would I, where would I be?
What would I do
If you were, if you were there when I needed you?
Where would I, where would I be?
What would I do
If you were, if you were there when I needed you?
What would I-
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I
Needed you
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do
Needed you, needed you, needed you...
What would I-
I could count them if I want to
All these years I've wasted on you
You gave up, I grew up
Oh, I can't help, but wonder
Where would I, where would I be?
What would I do
If you were, if you were there when I needed you?
Where would I, where would I be?
What would I do
If you were, if you were there when I needed you?
What would I-
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I
Needed you
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do
Needed you, needed you, needed you...
What would I-
