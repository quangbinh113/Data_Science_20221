Song Name: j's lullaby (darlin' i'd wait for you)
Darlin', I'd wait for you
Even if you didn't ask me to
Tie a lasso around the moon
And bring it on down to you
I'd bottle the feelin' you give me
And shelve that stuff for years to come
'Cause, baby, when your arms are around me
I'd swear that I'm holding the sun
I'd give you the sun if you asked me
You could have all of the time
You could have the stars and the trees
When dividin' up the universe
You could have mine
You could have mine
Darlin', I wish that you
Could give me some more time
To herd the whole sky in my arms
And release it when you're mine
I'd tell you, "I thought I loved you too"
I just didn't have the words to say
I'd put the piece in your backyard
In hopes to be enough for you to stay
I'd give you the sun if you asked me
You could have all of the time
You could have the stars and the trees
When dividin' up the universe
You could have mine
You could have mine
I'd give you the sun
I'd give you the sun
I'd give you the sun if you asked me (I'd give you the sun)
You could have all of the time
You could have the stars and the trees (I'd give you the sun)
When dividing up the universe
You could have mine
You could have mine
You could have mine
Goodnight
Goodnight
