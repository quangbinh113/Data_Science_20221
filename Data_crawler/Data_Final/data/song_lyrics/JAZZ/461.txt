Song Name: used to
I don't fucking miss you, I just think about you now and then
Usually in the mornings or when I see your Jeep Liberty
Wonder if I ever cross your mind when you're in bed with him
Wonder if your brothers ever bring me up at supper, yeah
Don't you worry 'bout me, I got girls here from Dominican
We are getting faded in my bedroom, they be sleeping in
Yeah, I'm doing great, though I wasn't the one that wanted this
Still, thinking about you, shit
Are you staying out 'till five every night like you used to?
Drinking too much wine every night like we used to?
Cutting up your shorts, so the guys will look at you?
Not worrying 'bout you's taking some getting used to
Does he take his time like the way that I used to?
Designated drive every night like I used to?
Hold on to your feet while you scream out the sunroof?
All this extra time's taking some getting used to

Don't know how to fill the space inside my bed you left me with
Searching for you in every girl out here in Los Angeles
Kept the naughty photos, but I never ever showed a friend
Even though we broke up, I never broke all our promises
I know I'm the one that made the hardest of decisions, yet
You're the one that ended things, and now you fucking cheated, yeah
Constantly think about you and I'm hurting
But I won't say I miss you, 'cause you don't deserve it
Are you staying out 'till five every night like you used to?
Drinking too much wine every night like we used to?
Cutting up your shorts, so the guys will look at you?
Not worrying 'bout you's taking some getting used to
Does he take his time like the way that I used to?
Designated drive every night like I used to?
Hold on to your feet while you scream out the sunroof?
All this extra time's taking some getting used to
All this extra time takes some getting used to
I won't ever say it, I still fucking miss you
All this extra time takes some getting used to
I won't ever say it, but I will always miss you
I still fucking miss you
I still fucking miss you
I still fucking miss you
Don't you worry 'bout me, I got girls here from Dominican
We are getting faded in my bedroom, they be sleeping in
Yeah, I'm doing great, though I wasn't the one that wanted this
Still, thinking about you, shit
