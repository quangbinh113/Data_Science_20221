Song Name: Evil Gal Blues
I'm an evil gal
Don't you bother with me
Yes I'm an evil gal
Don't you bother with me
I'll empty your pockets and fill you with misery
I've got men to the left
Men to the right
Men every day and men every night
I've got so many men
Mmm I don't know what to do
So I'm tellin' you daddy
I ain't no good to you
I've got men in the east
Men in the west
But my man here in Harlem always loves me the best
I'm an evil gal
And I need an evil man
But I'm down in the dumps since I lost him to Uncle Sam
If you want to be happy
Don't hang around with me
Mmm I said if you wanna be happy
Don't hang around with me
'Cause I'm an evil gal and I want to set you free
