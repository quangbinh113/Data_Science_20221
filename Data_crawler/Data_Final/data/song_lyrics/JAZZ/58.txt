Song Name: Wait for You - Demo
Been meaning to tell you
What's on my mind

I must've thought about it
A thousand times
Yeah we've been talking
For some time now
So why don't we see what this could be about
I don't know
Think it's time you should let
Let me see
What this love
Could really be
Give it time you say
Baby you know I'll be waiting
I don't give you your time
You know that I'm always there
To treat you right
You made me feel special through the days and nights
I thought that you'd be the one
To hold me down
But I found out you've
Been messing around
Now I see
That you're not meant for me (that you're not meant for me)
You should go (you should go)
Go ahead and leave me
All alone (all alone)
Oh I gave you time
And you wasted mine
So now what do I do
(You know that) I'd always wait for you

I thought you'd be here too
I'd always wait for you
I thought you'd be here too
