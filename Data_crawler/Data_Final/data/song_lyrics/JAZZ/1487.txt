Song Name: Slipping Away - 1996
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far (oh yeah)
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
I keep on reaching and I
I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me, baby
I keep on yearning and I
I guess I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes
So far, so far (no, no, no, baby)
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
I keep denying that our
Our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play
I can't remember when you
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
The silence chills me to the bone
So far, so far (yeah)
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far (yeah)
You're slipping away, away
Slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
Further, further
You're so far
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (you're so far)
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
You're so far (so far, so far)
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from what we had
Truly, I just don't understand
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading so fast it seems
You know you're slipping away
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof (so afraid)
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (yeah)
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof (so far)
Where is the boy that you used to be? (So far)
Baby, you're slipping away from me...
