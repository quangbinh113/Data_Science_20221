Song Name: Can We Kiss Forever?
I tried to reach you, I can't hide
How strong's the feeling when we dive
Across the ocean of my mind
My wounds are healing with the salt
All my senses intensified
Whenever you and I would dive
Across the ocean of my mind
But in the end I drown, you pushed me down, down
(You pushed me down, down)
(You pushed me down, down)
(You pushed me down, down)
(You pushed me down, down)
Oh, they shame
When you call my name
I felt pain
When you came
