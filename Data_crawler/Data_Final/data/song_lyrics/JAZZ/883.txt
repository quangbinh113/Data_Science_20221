Song Name: Crazy - Radio 1 Live Lounge Session
I remember when, remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that phase
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space... space, space, space
When you're out there without care
I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably
And I hope that you're having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
Come on now
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? (huh)
Bless your soul
You really think you're in control
Well I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes have the heart to lose their lives out on the limb (yeah)
All I remember is thinking I want to be like them (yeah)
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
They looked like fun
And it's not coincidence I've come
I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
Maybe we're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
