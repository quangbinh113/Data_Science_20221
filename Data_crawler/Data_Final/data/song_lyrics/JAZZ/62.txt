Song Name: What Do You Feel About Me
Since we're apart
My world is sad and lonely

Don't understand why does it cold and stormy
But I had enough
Let's just see how it could be
So what do you feel about me?
How is it going?
What you've been thinking lately?
Do you remember how it used to be?
And I had enough
This is not how it should be
Then what do you feel about me
I wish you shelter and fire
To keep you warm
And more than a cozy blanket in a storm
But I had enough
Love does not come easily
Then what do you feel about
Then what do you feel about
Then what do you feel about me?
Then what do you feel about me?
Then what do you feel about me?
