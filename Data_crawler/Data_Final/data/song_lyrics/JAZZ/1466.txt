Song Name: Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)
If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey fare thee well
Well, I had a man, strong and tall
He moved his body like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
I remember one evening in the pouring rain
And in my heart was an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
Muddy river runs muddy and wild
You can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
So as show us a bird flying high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
