Song Name: Rome Wasn't Built in a Day
You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll fly away
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
In this day and age it's so easy to stress
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
In order to love child we got to be strong

I'm caught in the crossfire why can't we get along
'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll fly away
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere

I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
Though we know we were wrong, we can' t give up the fight
Oh no
'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll run away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day (hey, hey, hey)
You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll fly away
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
You and me (you and me) we're meant to be (meant to be)
Walking free (walking free) in harmony (in harmony)
One fine day (one fine day) we' ll ran away
(We gonna ran away, we gonna ran away)
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
You and me (you and me) we're meant to be (meant to be)
Walking free (walking free) in harmony (in harmony)
One fine day (one fine day) we' ll fly away
(We gonna ran away, we gonna ran away)
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
