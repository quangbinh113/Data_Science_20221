Song Name: Be The Change (The Shelter)
Every day, you say, "I will make a better world"
Life is not a fairy tale, no, not for boys and girls
We got to
Stop the talking, got to get down
Stop the talking, got to get down
Intentions only take you far
When you're on the road
Don't wait around for people to
Do what you should do
You got to
Stop the talking, got to get down
Stop the talking, got to get down
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
So, be the one who's standin' up when they're lookin' at ya
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
Don't be tomorrow, waitin' for the day to pass ya
A heavy heart can slow you down
When you're not aware
Clear the spaces in your mind
Stop to breathe the air
Lay a brick day by day
Build your house of love
Show that there's a better way
To help us rise above
You got to
Stop the talking, got to get down
Stop the talking, got to get down
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
So, be the one who's standin' up when they're lookin' at ya
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
Don't be tomorrow, waitin' for the day to pass ya
If not now, then when?
Just begin
If not now, then when?
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
So, be the one who's standin' up when they're lookin' at ya
So, be the change, so, be the shelter
Don't be tomorrow, waitin' for the day to pass ya
