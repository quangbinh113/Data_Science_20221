Song Name: Tonight May Have To Last Me All My Life - Remastered
Hold me close to you
Say you love me too
Tonight may have to last me all my life
Leave a memory
To keep me company
Tonight may have to last me all my life
Then
When I'm alone without you
I can always dream about you
Every hour you stay
Will make a dream bouquet
That I'll see goin' past me all my life
So have no regret
Darling, don't forget
Tonight may have to last me all my life
