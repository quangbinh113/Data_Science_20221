Song Name: She Make It Clap (Freestyle)
Ay, ay, ay M-U-L-A (Mula baby)
Ay, hold on aye what he say? (Woo)
She make it clap, clap, clap
Yeah, you can get clapped, clapped, clapped (on gang ay) hold on ay
(You already know how I'm rockin')
(Like cut off stockings keep cash in my pockets)
(All designer get your grind up not your funny up)
(Lame ass nigga and we counting big chips big strips and all that)
Ay, ay, wait aye hold on, ay shh
You hear that?
That's the sound of how I'm thumb them racks
Extended little clip on a drum with some tits, it go thra
That's the sounds of that motherfucking MAC
Ay, she toot it up, throw it back on the D
Round of applause, how I, how I smack on her ass
Ay, mе going broke that's a myth stop the cap
Bitch, you know I keep racks, on racks on racks
Ay, niggas talk down on my namе to a bitch
He can't get for a fact, yeah, you can get clapped
Ay, I don't give a fuck 'bout none of that shit
Asian doll, knock your ass, put you off of that map
She make it clap to the sound of the beat
How she throw that ass back while she making it clap
No, I can't fuck with him 'cause I know he a rat
Way before this Corona, I been rocking masks
Ay, circle real smaller than middle of CDs
Came out the blue, rocking and ice and some VVs
Niggas sneak diss but they really wanna be me
I got all these hoes tryna pull up and eat me
Ay, it cost some money to pull and see me
Niggas be watching me more than some TVs
Yeah, I make this shit look so easy, believe me
I poured me a Four in some pint, now I'm sleepy
And you can get shook like motherfucking Martini's
We aiming anything that don't got titties
If we don't hit you, double back like a Frisbee
If it ain't man down then we pop up like genies
And bro in this bitch sending shots like a sub tweet
We on yo' cap like a motherfucking Beanie
At first they ain't believe me but now I'm on TV
I got all these hoess at my shoes flashing chi's chi's (ay, gang)
Hold on, what he say? (Woo)
Yeah, ah she make it clap, clap, clap
You can get clapped, clapped, clapped
Ay, gang (woo) what he say? (Mula baby)
She make it clap, clap, clap
Yeah, you can get whacked, whacked, whacked (Mula baby)
