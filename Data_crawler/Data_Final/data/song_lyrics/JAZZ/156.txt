Song Name: Why Would I Be
I think I lost my mind
I think I lost my s̶h̶i̶t̶
On the thing that I believe
On the thing that I believe
I believe I let you go
Pretty sure you're no longer inside my veins
Turns out I still can feel the jealousy
When I see you with another man
Why would I be
Strained by the rain of those memories of you
Why would I be
Trapped in a place without no name
Hoping that you would tell me
I think I lost my faith
Not because I don't believe in love
But as long as I remember
Love always brought me down
Love always brought me down
I'm sink in my own thoughts
Drained in my own world
Still carrying the melodies of you
I can still feel the jealousy
When I hear another name inside your prayer
Why would I be
Strained by the rain of those memories of you
Why would I be
Trapped in a place without no name
Hoping that you would tell me
Why would I be
Trapped in a place without no name
Hoping that you would tell me
