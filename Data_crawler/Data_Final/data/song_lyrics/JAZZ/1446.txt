Song Name: Oblivion
Be there when the Summertime ends
And closing in like the tide, in winter time
Don't run just wait and you will see
That we are destined to be if only you'll be mine
Don't you lose sight of what you want
And care about the simple things in life that bring you joy
And weight away the darkness
Leave your worries far behind you
And leave your lonesome on the shelf next to the classic novels
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
(Pa da da da da da da)
Sometimes you lose but that's okay cause you got people in your life
That love you, and care about you
Appreciate the ones that stay and listen to
Your helpless ways going on and fearing of oblivion
Don't you lose sight of what you, want
Care about the simple things in life that
Bring you joy and weight away the darkness
Leave your worries far behind (you)
And leave your lonesome on the shelf
