Song Name: Mambo Tonight
While I am staring at the ceiling wondering if she's wondering why
While I'm wishing every moment
Maybe she'll pass me by
I dream of mambo every night
Each step of passion pure delight
But when will she dance into my eyes
I know that we could move as one
Eyes locked until the dance's done
So tell me you dance this mambo tonight
Lying wild awake yet dreaming
Dreaming how I've lived to dance with you Praying waiting for your answer
To a question so overdo
I dream of mambo every night
Each step of passion pure delight
But when will she dance into my eyes
I know that we could move as one
Eyes locked until the dance's done
So tell me you dance this mambo in the night
I dream of mambo every night
Each step of passion pure delight
But when will she into my eyes
I know that we could move as one
Eyes locked until the dance's done
So tell me you dance this mambo tonight
