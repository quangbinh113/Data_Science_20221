Song Name: Cola
Got ready for the night and
She's heading for the lights
She sees the vision going
Hopping line after line
See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

That's what you're coming for but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask her what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
She can't tell the difference yet
She can't tell the difference yet
She can't tell the difference yet
That's what you're coming for but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask them what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
That's what you're coming for but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask her what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
Got ready for the night and
She's heading for the lights
She sees the vision going
Hopping line after line
See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
She can't tell the difference yet
That's what you're coming for but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask them what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
That's what you're coming for but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask her what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
