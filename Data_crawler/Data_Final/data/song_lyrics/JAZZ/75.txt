Song Name: Falling for You
But I'd love to get to know you
Know all the girls adore you
Who am I to blame
There's something 'bout you
You make it look so easy
Your words what do they mean
Tell me what to do
Think I'm falling for
You and everything about you is contagious
You and the way your smile lights up a room
You whenever someone mentions your name
I'm crazy for you
Falling but I'm not sure, I'm confused
But I'd love to get to know you
Know all the girls adore you
Who am I to blame
There's something 'bout you
You make it look so easy
Your words what do they mean
Tell me what to do
Think I'm falling for you
You got your way with words
I'm not that easy
You should know by now
I'm not like those other girls
You think I'd fall that fast
Oh boy believe me
You don't know my past
What my heart's been through
But I'd love to get to know you
Know all the girls adore you
Who am I to blame
There's something 'bout you
You make it look so easy
Your words what do they mean
Tell me what to do
Think I'm falling for you
But I'd love to get to know you
Know all the girls adore you
Who am I to blame
There's something 'bout you
You make it look so easy
Your words what do they mean
Tell me what to do
Think I'm falling for you
