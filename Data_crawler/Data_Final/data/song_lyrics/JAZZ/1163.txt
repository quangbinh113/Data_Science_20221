Song Name: Walking In The Rain
Walking down the street
Kicking cans
Looking at the billboards
Oh so rad
Summing up the people
Checking out the race
Doing what I'm doing
Feeling out of place
Walking, walking
In the rain
Feeling like a woman
Looking like a man
Sounding like a no-no
Mating when I can
Whistling in the darkness
Shining in the night
Coming to conclusions
Right is night is tight
Walking, walking
In the rain
Come in all you jesters
Enter all you fools
Sit down no-no's
Vulgar fools
Trip the light fantastic
Dance the swivel hips
Coming to conclusions
Button up your lips
Walking, walking in the rain
Walking, walking in the rain
