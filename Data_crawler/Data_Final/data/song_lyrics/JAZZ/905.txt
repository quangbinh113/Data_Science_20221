Song Name: One Note Samba
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note
Now this new one is the
Consequence of the one
We've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable
Consequence of you
There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale and I know and at the end
I've come to nothing, or nearly nothing
So I come back to that first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Re, mi, fa, so, la, te, do
He will find himself with no show
Better play that note you know
He will find himself with no show
Better play that note you know
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note
Now this new one is the
Consequence of the one
We've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable
Consequence of you
There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know and at the end
I've come to nothing, or nearly nothing
So I come back to that first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who want the whole show
Re, mi, fa, so, la, te, do
He will find himself with no show
Better play that note you know
