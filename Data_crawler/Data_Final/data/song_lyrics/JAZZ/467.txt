Song Name: IDGAF (with blackbear)
You were caught in a lie, said it with your eyes
Said to all my homies that you weren't even mine
You didn't think twice, got a heart made of ice
And that shit hit me, did me dirty
I never asked why and I never did cry
I never told another how I felt inside
My demons don't hide when I'm dreaming at night
And I won't mislead you, you'll miss me
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore
You would never talk about me before
You lied, looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me (yeah), now shit's history
I don't mind if we speak again
I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be friends
Leave me half-alive, on my homies you was flirty
Fill me up with lies, and you did me so dirty
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Left me bleeding with my heart on the floor
You were never really mine, I was never really yours
You're the demon on my shoulder I'm just trying to ignore
And I don't give a shit about your fake-ass friends
Hollywood Hills, where we play pretend
I don't wanna say I'm sorry, I don't wanna make amends
I will never make a mistake like you again
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore
You would never talk about me before
You lied, looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me, now shit's history
Regardless, you're so heartless
Lead my heart into your darkness
Hid the truth behind your harmless, pretty face (aw)
And I know you're running out of other options
Live in your head rent-free, a neurotoxin
And I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
Knowing full well you were put up for adoption
Oh shit, yeah, I went there, but honestly, I don't care
You never tried to play fair with me
Left me broken with scars, making all these remarks
So now this is the part where I leave
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more (no more)
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors (down doors)
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore (you swore)
You would never talk about me before (before)
You lied, looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me, now shit's history
