Song Name: Guess Who I Saw Today - Remastered/2004
You're so late getting home from the office
Did you miss your train?
Were you caught in the rain?
No, don't bother to explain
Can I fix you a quick martini?
As a matter of fact
I'll have one with you
For to tell you the truth
I've had quite a day too
Guess who I saw today, my dear
I went in town to shop around for something new
And thought I'd stop and have a bite when I was through
I looked around for some place near
And it occurred to me where I had parked the car
There was a most attractive French caf√© and bar
It really wasn't very far
The waiter showed me to a dark secluded corner
And as my eyes became accustomed to the gloom
I saw two people at the bar who were so in love
That even I could spot it clear across the room
Guess who I saw today my dear
I've never been so shocked before
I headed blindly through the door
They didn't see me passing through
Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today?
I saw you
