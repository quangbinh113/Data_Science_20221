Got him asking, "Where you from?" Da-da-di-da-dum
Does that booty have a da-da-di-da-dum?
Once you get it you'll be done da-di-da-dum
Gotta finish with your da-da-di-da-dum
So you're tryna bе my baby? Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Why you talking? What's your sign? What's your flavor? Yеah
Don't hit me with no, "Possibly" (hey, yeah)
You still love me, boy, you gotta be
A lover, my body's my language
Do I gotta tell you in Spanish?
Come handle it
Si no, yo no vuelvo pa' tras

You know you want this
Way too hot to ignore like a temptress
The way I walk through that door in this tight dress
Ain't too hard to slip off
And you touching on my body, I can't help but want some more, yeah
Make that bubblegum pop, pop, pop, pop; don't stop
You can take me to the top, top, top, top; oh, yeah
Like it when that booty drop, drop, drop, drop
Take it off, it's getting hot, hot, hot, hot
Para bailar la bamba (ooh, yeah)
Come on and give me your number (come on)
If you don't answer the text, yeah
We can't have fun next time, now I got your number (oh-ooh)
Para bailar la bamba (ooh, yeah)
Come on and give me your number (come on and give me your number)
If you don't answer the text, yeah
We can't have fun next time, now I got your number (oh-ooh)
