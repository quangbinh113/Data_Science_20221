Song Name: All Night
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that's how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
Wide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
I'm never gonna find my way
If I don't learn to let go
The past is the past, today is today
And there's things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Won't you come and take me home
Oh I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream
Can you, you wake me up before you leave
I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
Wide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
Whoa, as long as I'm with you (no sleep)
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'
