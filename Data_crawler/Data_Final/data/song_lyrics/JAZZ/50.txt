Song Name: Rose
I see a rose
It reminds me of you
Oh, so precious
With thorns that could hurt me
You know I don't lie
So I tell you the truth
That I'm so in love with you
Even when you hurt me too
So I'll start with picking petals from the rose
Every time you don't deserve what I've done for you
When all is gone, I will be too
Huh, ha, hmm
Huh, ha, hmm
Sometimes when I wake
With a smile on my face
Dreamin' of you
But it was all good to be true
And I know my worth
And maybe I'm holding back
From what I truly need
And it's not how you've been treating me
So I'll start with picking petals from the rose
Every time you don't deserve what I've done for you
When all is gone, I will be too
Huh, ha, hmm
Huh, ha, hmm
And there's one
There goes another
I'm plucking the last one
And just like that I'm all gone
I'm all gone, I'm all gone
I'm all gone, I'm all gone
I'm gone, mmm
I'm all gone
