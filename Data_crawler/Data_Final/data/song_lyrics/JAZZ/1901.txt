Song Name: Evenin' (with Ray Charles)
Evening, every night you come and you find me
Must you always come and remind me that my gal has gone
Evening, can't you see I'm deeply in your power
Every minute seems like an hour, since my gal's gone
Shadows fall on the wall, that's the time I miss you most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on
Take me evening, let me sleep till great dawn is breakin'
You know what, I don't care if I don't awaken, since my gal's gone
Shadows fall on the wall, that's the time I miss her most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on
Take me Evening, take me evening, let me sleep till great dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my gal is gone
I know how you feel, since my gal's gone
Since my gal's gone
