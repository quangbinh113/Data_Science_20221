Song Name: You're Driving Me Crazy
You, you're driving me crazy
What did I do? What ever did I do?
My tears for you, they make everything hazy
Clouding the skies that used to be blue
How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, you were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you
Yes you, you are driving me crazy
What did I do, did I do to you?
How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you
Yes you, baby, you, you're are driving me crazy
What did I do? Tell me what did I do?
Please, what did I do to you?
