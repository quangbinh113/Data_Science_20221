Song Name: A Certain Someone
Someone like you
Only comes around about once
In a week
Somebody like you
A certain someone I can sit and speak
Friends just like you
Only come around about once
Every couple years
A friend just like you
A certain someone to exchange my laughs and tears with
And all day long I search and there you perch
Just waiting to be found
I've searched so far and here you are
Just watching me stumble around
A lover like you
Only comes around about once
In a lifetime
Somebody like you
A friend who's quite true
A lover who knows no bounds
You don't show up often so I'd really like to keep you around
