Song Name: I'm Always Drunk In San Francisco (And I Don't Drink At All)
I'm always drunk in San Francisco
I always stay out of my mind
But if you've been to San Francisco
They say that things like this go on all the time
It never happens nowhere else
Maybe it's the air
Can't really seem to help myself
And what's mine I don't care
I'm always drunk in San Francisco
I'll never feel any pain
But tell me why does San Francisco
Jump is like a lover's lane go
Straight to my brain
I guess it's just the mind I'm in
And acts like alcohol
Because I'm drunk in San Francisco
And I don't drink at all.
