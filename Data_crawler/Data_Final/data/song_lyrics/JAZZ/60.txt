Song Name: Happier Than Ever
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fu-
I don't relate to you (no, I don't)
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You make me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
All that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
Oh, and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
I'd have an empty line, 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone
