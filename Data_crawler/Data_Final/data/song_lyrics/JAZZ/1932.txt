Song Name: When Do the Bells Ring for Me
I wonder when the bells ring for me?
When someone tugs a heartstring for me?
When does it come my time?
When does the poem rhyme?
When do the songs they sing, sing for me?
To those who say, "Hey wake up and feel life"
I say, "I'm ready, show me the way"
Show me those arms that say 'Welcome to real life'
And I'll stay, I'll stay
How many parties more can I run to?
How many little loves can there be
Before it's all a bore?
Forget it, I want more
I want someone to want more of me
Like making promies good in the daylight
The thing is here am I - where is she?
When is it my chance?
When is it my dance?
When do the bells ring for me?
