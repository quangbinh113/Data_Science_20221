Song Name: Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me - 1956 Version
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam
Of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word
Of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True, I've been seen
With someone new
But does that mean
That I'm untrue?
When we're apart
The words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But don't do nothin' 'til you hear it from me
And you never will
I've been seen
With someone new
But does that mean
That I'm untrue?
When we're apart
The words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But don't do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin'
Do nothin'
