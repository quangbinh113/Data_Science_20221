Song Name: Warm My Soul
She led me to a pot of gold,
Like a summer night she warms my soul,
Four kisses in the morning,
More kisses at night,
Warm my soul,
Now i'm whole.
She makes me lose all my control,
She makes me lose all my control,
Like a flower she blooms for me,
In a garden i'll always be,
Warm my soul,
Now i'm whole.
She led me to a pot of gold,
Like a summer night she warms my soul.
Warm my soul,
Now i'm whole,
Four kisses in the morning,
More kisses at night,
Warm my soul,
Now i'm whole,
Like a flower she blooms for me,
In a garden i'll always be,
Warm my soul,
Now i'm whole,
Four kisses in the morning,
More kisses at night,
And how she blooms for me...
