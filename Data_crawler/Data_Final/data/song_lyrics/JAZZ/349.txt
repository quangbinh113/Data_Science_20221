Song Name: idfc - Tarro Remix
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care
At all
You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care
At all
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too
Good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all
Oh
Oh, yeah
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care
At all
You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words (slurring all your words)
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care
At all
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too
Good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all, oh
Oh
Oh
I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care
