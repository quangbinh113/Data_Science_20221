Song Name: On My Mind - Demo
I just gotta say
That you're beautiful everyday
Ain't no other girl's
That be standing in your way
You know I'd be a fool
To see you walk away from me
Because baby you know you got me
There ain't other place that I'd rather be
You know why I do
The things that I do
Girl you know it's cuz I'm crazy for you
I know I may fuck up from time and time
But you know that you're the only thing on my mind
Oh you know that
I ain't fronting baby
Even the sun can't outshine you
You light up my day
In every kind of way
And your eyes those eyes
Girl I get so hypnotized
Can someone tell me why
You know why I do
The things that I do
Girl you know it's cuz I'm crazy for you
I know I may fuck up from time and time
But you know that you're the only thing on my mind
Now I've made mistakes
And you've been away
But let's not let us go to waste
I'm thinking about you
And everything that you do
Girl don't you know
That I need you
You know why I do
The things that I do
Girl you know it's cuz I'm crazy for you
I know I may fuck up from time and time
But you know that you're the only thing on my mind
