Song Name: Angel Eyes
Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love is misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drinks and the laugh's on me
Pardon me, but I, I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Gotta find who's now number one
And why, why my angel eyes ain't here
So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drinks and the laugh's on me
Pardon me, but I've got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And why my angel eyes ain't here
'Scuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes
