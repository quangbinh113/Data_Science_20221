Song Name: Wanna Be Close
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
There's something about the way your light shines
I wanna be a part of you
I won't stop until I feel your light inside
I wanna feel the things you do
The cloud's in my way can't persuade me to turn back
I won't let distance be the reason, I'm better than that
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
I'm willing to climb up the mountain high
If that's what it takes that's what I'll do
And if I need to fly the leaf I'll try
I'm not afraid of heaven's point of view
You're my destination, my motivation, you're my fuel
You're my fuel in my journey
My journey's not over until I'm in the presence of you
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
I just wanna be close, where you are
I just wanna be next to you, but you're too far
I just wanna be close to you babe
I just wanna be by your side babe
I just wanna keep you in my arms babe
I just wanna keep you safe from harm babe
I just wanna be where you are babe
I don't wanna let you go too far babe
We can live amongst the stars my baby
The whole universe is ours my babe, yeah
