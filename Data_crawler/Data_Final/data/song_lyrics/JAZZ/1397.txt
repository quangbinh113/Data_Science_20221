Song Name: Beautiful Love
Beautiful love
You're all a mystery
Beautiful love
What have you done to me?
I was contented 'til you came along
Thrilling my soul with your song
Beautiful love
I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dream to realise
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love
Will my dreams come true?
Beautiful love
You're all a mystery
Beautiful love
What have you done to me?
I was contented 'til you came along
Thrilling my soul with your song
Beautiful love
I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realise
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love
Will my dreams come true?
