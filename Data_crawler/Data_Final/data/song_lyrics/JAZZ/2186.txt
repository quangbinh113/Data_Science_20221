Song Name: It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)
What good is melody?
What good is music?
If it ain't possessing something sweet
It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
There's something else that makes the tune complete
Oh, It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(Do a Do ap...)
It don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing
(Do a Do ap...)
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got, oh
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(Do a Do ap...)
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got, oh
It don't mean a thing
Everybody's got the swing
(Do a Do ap...)
Ehhh
Do a Do ap
Do-o-oh
Do-a-a-a-h!
