Song Name: I Wish You Love
I wish you blue birds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some gleave me glade
I wish you help
And more than wealth
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best
My very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the store
A cousy fine to keep you warm
But most of all
When snow flakes fall
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best
My very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the store
A cousy fine to keep you warm
But most of all
When snow flakes fall
I wish you love
But most of all
I wish you love
