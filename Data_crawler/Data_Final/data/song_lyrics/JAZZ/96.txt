Song Name: Beautiful Life
At last
We've found some time
To be together
Just you and me
Caught up in life
Keeping up with the Joneses
While you're my priority
Take my hand
We can slow dance, don't need music
And talk like it's our first date
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thing
Our love has grown
But it would be a mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Call me naive, a hopeless romantic
But I still think you're fine
Before the bills, the car, the house, and the baby
Sugar, you were all mine, all mine
Take my hand and we could revisit the place
Where we shared our first kiss
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thing
Our love has grown
But it would be a mistake (a big mistake)
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Through the years
We have made so many memories
And I am still madly in love, 3000
Way past the honeymoon, but
Don't care that we've grown up
You make our love feel brand new
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thing (I wouldn't change)
Our love has grown
But it would be a mistake (can we take it now?)
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thing (I wouldn't change)
Our love has grown
But it would be a mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
My, oh my
You still give me butterflies
Let's not forget
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
