Song Name: Falling in Love
You and I
We go together like birds and the sky
From the moment that you caught my eye
Knew that I was falling in love
You and I
A feeling warmer than sun in July
Since the day that you came in my life
Knew that I was falling in love
You and I
We'll be together
You and I
Forever
You and I
Our sorrows half and our joys multiplied
Nothing silver or gold could ever buy
You and I are falling in love
You and I
We'll be together
You and I
Forever
You and I
Our sorrows half and our joys multiplied
Promise you 'til the day that I die
You and I will be falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
