Song Name: Copacabana
Copacabana lovely place in Brazil
Where every pair of eyes would give you a frail
Ask any good Romancer
He’ll give you just one answer
Copacabana
Blue skies above the bitch
Are bluard and blue
Romance and moonlight will be searching for you
You’re sure to be a lover
The moment you discover
Copacabana
Blue skies above the bitch
Are bluard and blue
Romance and moonlight will be searching for you
You’re sure to be a lover
The moment you discover
Copacabana
