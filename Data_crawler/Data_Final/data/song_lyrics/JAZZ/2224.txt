Song Name: Born To Be Blue
Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few
And clovers being green
Is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue
When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view
But moonbeams being gold
Are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the courtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But there's nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the courtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue
