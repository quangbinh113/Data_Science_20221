Song Name: Weakness
Yeah I came into the lesser fire
My body aches to be satisfied
My weakness comes and goes
My weakness comes and goes
I'm reaching out for the easy high
Please fortify this strength of mine
My weakness comes and goes
My weakness comes and goes
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
Yeah I came into the lesser fire
My body aches to be satisfied
My weakness comes and goes
My weakness comes and goes
I'm reaching out for the easy high
Please fortify this strength of mine
My weakness comes and goes
My weakness comes and goes
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
(My weakness comes and goes)
My weakness echoes in my soul
With all the echoes in my soul
My weakness comes and goes
It goes
It goes
My weakness echoes in my soul
With all the echoes in my soul
My weakness comes and goes
It goes
It goes
