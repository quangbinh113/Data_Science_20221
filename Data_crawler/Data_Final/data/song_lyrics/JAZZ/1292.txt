Song Name: I Feel Like I'm Drowning
You keep dreamin' and dark schemin'
Yeah, you do
You're a poison and I know that, it's the truth
All my friends think you're vicious
And they say you're suspicious
You keep dreamin' and dark schemin'
Yeah, you do
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
You're holdin' me down and
Holdin' me down
You're killin' me slow
So slow, oh no
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
You're so plastic and that's tragic just for you
I don't know what the hell yo' gonna do
When your looks start depleting
And your friends all start leaving
You're so plastic, and that's tragic just for you
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
You're holdin' me down and
Holding me down
You're killin' me slow
So slow, oh no
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
My life's okay, yeah
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
You're holdin' me down and
Holdin' me down
You're killin' me slow
So slow, oh no
I feel like I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
