Song Name: Feel It
I don't wanna keep you waiting
That's why you blame it on me, oh
You just giving me your secrets
And I wanted to, yeah
'Cause this was on you, baby
And it's only true, yeah
I'm gonna feel it, feel it so strong
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I'm gonna feel it, feel it so strong
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I wanted you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I want you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
Uh, even if I wanna play this
'Cause that's what they're expecting from me, yeah
I will never burden it
And this is about to

'Cause this was on you, baby
And it's only true, yeah
I'm gonna feel it, feel it so strong
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I'm gonna feel it, feel it so strong
This is tryna making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I wanted you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I want you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say
