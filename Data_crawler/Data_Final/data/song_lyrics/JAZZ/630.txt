Song Name: Can't Help Falling In Love - Live From Spotify, NYC / 2015
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you.
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help
Falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
So take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
