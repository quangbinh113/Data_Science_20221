Song Name: Getaway
I need to getaway
I need to getaway
I got caught up in my old ways
Can't believe I waited so long
To change and open up a new phase
I just had to getaway
Say what you think about that
My darlin' angel
I know I've been holding back
So, now I'm letting go
Let's take a plane from here and getaway
Find our own secret place and getaway
Please forget what was our yesterday
Just let me just show you love
Let's just getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I need to getaway
Broken-hearted from my past mistakes
Don't wanna feel so lost and all alone
I was foolish and now so ashamed
So come with me and getaway
What do you think about that
My darling angel
Please let me win you back
Oh, now letting go
Let's take a plane from here and getaway
Find our own secret place and getaway
Let's leave our worries for another day
Maybe, it's crazy but
Let's just getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I need to getaway
Get, get getaway
I want your loving
On and on (on and on)
We keep going (we keep going)
On and on
And I won't stop
And I won't let go
Do do do do do do do da do
Do do do do do do do da do
Do do do do do do do da do
Do do do do do do do da do
