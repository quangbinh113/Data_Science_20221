Song Name: Undefined
I need to find another way to express a simple phrase
A more enchanting way to say I love you
I'd like to be astute
And this sentence seems minute
Head over heels is simply too graceful for me
So could there be a better means
To articulate my dreams
My passion and desire escapes all languages
Words seem to fall flat each time I try to speak my mind
How I feel for you is undefined
I need to find another way to express a simple phrase
A more enchanting way to say I love you
I'd like to be astute
And this sentence seems minute
Head over heels is simply too graceful for me
So could there be a better means
To articulate my dreams
My passion and desire escapes all languages
Words seem to fall flat each time I try to speak my mind
How I feel for you is undefined
