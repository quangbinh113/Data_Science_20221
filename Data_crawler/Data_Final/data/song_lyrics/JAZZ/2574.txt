Song Name: My Sweet Hunk O' Trash - Single Version
You don't act up too much
Ain't got that glamour touch
You're trifling lazy
Ain't worth a cigarette ash
(Look out there, mamma)
(Look out there)
(You carry me too fast, watch it, baby)
You're just my good for nothin'
My sweet hunk o' trash
(My, my, how you sound)
You're very short on looks (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dumb when it comes to books
(Look out, baby)
(Watch it, honey)
And you stay full of corn
Just like succotash
(What you want me to do in my idle moments?)
You're just a good for nothin'
But my sweet hunk o' trash
Let me get a word in there honey, you running your mouth
You said I've worried you for years
I'm just a butterfly moochin' beers
While you sweat over a hot stove slinging hash
(Work my fingers right down to the elbows)
Yes, I may be good-for-nothin'
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash
(First you admit it, baby)
You said I spread my love all around
And with the chicks all over town
But how can I when you keep me broke?
So I can't spend no cash
Yes, I may be good for nothin'
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash
(Listen here, pops)
You know you lie about your youth
(I don't lie, baby)
(I'm just careless with the truth, that's all)
How careless can you be?
(I don't know)
With all your chicks
You try to make a flash
(Now baby, it ain't like that, no)
But you're still my good for nothin'
My sweet hunk o' trash
Now when you stay out very late
It sure makes me mad to wait (how come, baby?)
'Cause you come home too tired
To raise just one eyelash
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, watch it, baby, watch it)
You're just good-for-nothin'
But you're my sweet hunk o' trash
Yes, indeed
