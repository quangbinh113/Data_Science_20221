Song Name: Close Enough for Love
You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet
Not perfect yet
But close enough for love
How old-fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss, we shared a dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day
When you and I
Are close enough for love
Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts and one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always
Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and in books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told
Not perfect yet
But close enough for love
