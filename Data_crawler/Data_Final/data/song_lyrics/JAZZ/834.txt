Song Name: Fade Out Lines - Radio Edit
Deeper down
It's everywhere I look
From Las Vegas to right here
Under your dresser
Right by your ear
It's creeping in sweetly
It's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear
Life was full and fruitful
And you could take a real bite
The juice pouring well over
Your skin's delight
But the shadow it grows
And takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this priceless ballet
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the deeper down
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
Heading deeper down
We're sliding without noticing
Our own decline
Heading deeper down
We're hanging onto
Sweet nothings left behind
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Down deeper down, yeah
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing, we slide down, deeper down
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight
Into the fade out line
Deeper down
