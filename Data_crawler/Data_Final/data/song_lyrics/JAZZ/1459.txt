Song Name: Ask DNA
Gummed up, brain dead? Mm, can't decide
You can't pray enough, you can't hide
You can be cool or you can cry
Do it wrong
Not at all
Or do it right
No one owes you, no one's to blame
Save for bad genes or DNA
Ask your conscience the why and how
Do it then
Do it when
But do it now
What's up (what's up) sweet cakes? (sweet cakes)
Who's hip (who's hip) anyway? (anyway)
Earthgirls (earthgirls) are easy (are easy)
What you gonna do, little buckaroo?
(Hey you, better ask her nice!)
All you gotta do, happy fool, is ask your mom
No, we all can't be super fly
GQ, PhD, FBI
You can pretend or you can try
Move ahead
Lay down dead
Or slip on by
When the truth seems so far away
Buddha loves you and Jesus saves
You need answers for your dismay
Ask yourself
Ask your mom
Ask DNA
What's up (what's up) sweet cakes? (sweet cakes)
Who's hip (who's hip) anyway? (anyway)
Earthgirls (earthgirls) are easy (are easy)
What you gonna do, little buckaroo?
(Hey you, better ask her nice!)
Yeah, all you gotta do, happy fool, is ask your mom
Kamakamakama ask your mama
Super groover mama, Dalai Lama
Kamakamakama ask your mama
Super groover mama, Dalai Lama
Kamakamakama ask your mama
Super groover mama, Dalai Lama
What's up (what's up) sweet cakes? (sweet cakes)
Who's hip (who's hip) anyway? (anyway)
Earthgirls (earthgirls) are easy (are easy)
What you wanna do, little buckaroo?
Come on!
What's up (what's up) sweet cakes? (sweet cakes)
Who's hip (who's hip) anyway? (anyway)
Earthgirls (earthgirls) are easy (are easy)
So what you gonna do, little buckaroo?
(Hey you, better ask her nice!)
All you gotta do, happy fool, is ask your mom
