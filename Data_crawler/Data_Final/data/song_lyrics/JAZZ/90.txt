Song Name: Gentlemen Don't
You and your fingers cross my lips
No I never felt like this before
No, no, no, no
I know I'm young but I know love
And I know I know an angel if I saw one
But I know very well
Gentlemen don't kiss and tell
I promise I won't tell the world
If you say you want to be my girl
In your own words
I'm just a simple man simple plan
Go to work take care of my fam
I'm sure you'd understand
Because your heaven sent, independent
Do you think you need me
I think I need you girl
Baby can't you see
I know very well
Gentlemen don't kiss and tell
I promise I won't tell the world
If you say you want to be my girl
In your own words
Cards on the table
Willing so able
Stable capable of holding you down
I am just saying
I'm not complaining
Your love is worth waiting for
I know very well
Gentlemen don't kiss and tell
I promise I won't tell the world
If you say you want to be my girl
In your own words
