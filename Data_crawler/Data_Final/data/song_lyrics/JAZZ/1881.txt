Song Name: Over the Rainbow
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams
You dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly, yeah
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
