Song Name: too good to be true
Up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night it's true
But I know that you, yeah
You come through on nights where it all seems right
It's just too good to be true
It's always too good to be true with you
Cause you had me brand new
I had plans to give you everything, girl
And I would have sold time
Just to get high on our memories, girl
It was me and you gainst the world
Baby, I loved our odds
But it was just a facade
You let me love a mirage
If you knew that it wasn't true girl
Then why would you steal my time from me
That's why you got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night it's true
Painting pictures more vivid than northern lights
Late nights, ponder images of only your face
Writing scriptures like Christians with good intentions
Cause I'm preaching bout the miracles you bring me each day
If I had a penny for every time you run on my mind
I could buy anything except for your time
And you don't even want mine
And trust me baby, that's fine
That's why you got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night it's true
But I know that you
You come through on nights where it all seems right
It's just too good to be true
It's always too good to be true with you
That's why you got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night it's true
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night it's true
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me up late at night
I been thinking, I been thinking
When I'm up late at night about you
You got me
