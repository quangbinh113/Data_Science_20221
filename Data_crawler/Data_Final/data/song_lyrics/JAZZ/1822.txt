Song Name: Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)
Ladies and Gentlemen
As you know we have something
Special for you at the Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's that?
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Funky,funky
How 'bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
Groovy,groovy,jazzy,funky,pounce,bounce,dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea
The rhythm keeps flowin'
It drips the MC
Sweet sugar pop, sugar pop rocks it
Pop ya don't stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I sure improve as I stick a move
Every poem's recited on top of the groove
Smooth, mind, floating like a butterfly
Notes that'll float,sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia
Yeah,yeah,yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
Biddy biddy bop
Funky,funky
Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin' in your dome,with Cesan(?) and Bach
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the river we cruisin'
Up, down,round and round, fr.(?) found
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Finesse the freak through the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mac and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Full and steady flow,I'm growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove,in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height,to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go, off I take ya
Dip trip, flip Fantasia
Yeah,yeah,yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
Biddy biddy bop
Funky,funky
Yeah,yeah,yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
Biddy biddy bop
Funky,funky
Jump to the jam,boogy-woogy jam slam
Bust the dialect,I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic masta
Rhymin' on the mic,I bring the suckas to disasta'
Beaucoup bucks, but I still rock Nike
With the razzle-dazzle, a star I might be
Scribble-drabble-scrabble, on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes, yes, yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip Fantasia
Ah, you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Give me more
Of that funky horn
What's that?
Yeah
Funky, funky
Biddy biddy bop
Biddy biddy bop
Funky, funky
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
Biddy biddy bop
Funky, funky
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Funky, funky
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
Biddy biddy bop
Funky, funky
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's that?
Biddy biddy bop
Yeah
