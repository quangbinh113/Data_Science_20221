Song Name: Run Away
You leave in the morning
With everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face
Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
'Cause the love that you need will never be found at home
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk about
Around town as they put you down
As hard as they would try, they'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them, just to your soul
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
