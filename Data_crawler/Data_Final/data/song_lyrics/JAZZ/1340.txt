Song Name: Delicious
Like ice cream on a summer stand
Chocolate truffle song is played
French fries and limonade
You're delicious
M&Ms all green and red
That's exactly what I said
You're delicious
Ooh
Come a little bit closer to
My lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
Ooh
Come a little bit closer to my lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
Like sunset on a sandy beach
Old one you're such a piece
Come closer I can reach your delicious
I must confess you're the best
My favourite claim there's no contest
Give me all and take no less
You're delicious
Ooh
Come a little bit closer to
My lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
Ooooh
Come a little bit closer to
My lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
Ooh
Come a little bit closer to
My lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
Ooh
Come a little bit closer to
My lips 'cause I want you
Don't be afraid to do what you do to me
You're delicious
