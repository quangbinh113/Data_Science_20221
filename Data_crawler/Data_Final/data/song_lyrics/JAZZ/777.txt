Song Name: Delight
Walkin' down the street
And you hear that heavy beat
Can't help but walk your feet
Down all the way 'til you meet
People laughin' and dancin' all night long
And through the flashing lights
See the band playing their own song
And you wanna see the world
Through different eyes just for tonight
And you're hoping that this night won't ever end
You'll surrender if you
Feel the music fold around you
And pull you into the light
Feel how it takes away your strain and stress
And turns it into delight just for tonight
Walk your feet down
Move to the beat if you can take it
Go ahead let your hands hit the ceiling
Move to the beat if you can't help it
It will control you and take you away just for tonight
Just for tonight
Walkin' down the street
And you hear that heavy beat
Can't help but walk your feet
Down all the way 'til you meet
People laughin' and dancin' all night long
And through the flashing lights
See the band playing their own song
And you wanna see the world
Through different eyes just for tonight
And you're hoping that this night won't night won't end
You'll surrender if you
Feel the music fold around you
And pull you into the light
Feel how it takes away your strain and stress
And turns it into delight just for tonight
Walk your feet down
