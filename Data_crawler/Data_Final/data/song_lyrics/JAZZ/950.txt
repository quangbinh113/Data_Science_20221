Song Name: One and Only
Different women
Different towns
All these ho's shut em down
Cause you the one and only
Yah yah
Ladies tryna make they rounds
I don't let them ho's around
Cause you the one and only
You the one and only only (swear)
You thee only one for me for me (yeah)
You the one and only, only (swear)
You thee only one for me for me
Usually I'm acting reckless
But you left me breathless
I'm a bit eccentric
Never would expect it
Yea I'm a skeptic
Guess u intercepted my heart
I must accept it
And lower my guard
And all these bitches in my DM
Getting curved yo
I told them that this dick is on reserve ho
Swear they acting like they ain't heard though
Go on get some water for ya thirst girl
You one of one
Second to none
There is plenty but not many like you under the sun
Yes guess I'm lucky I just hit a home run
So now we'll rule the world, and we'll leave 'em all stunned
Like
Different women, different towns
All these ho's shut em down
Cause you the one and only
Yah yah
Ladies tryna make they rounds
I don't let them ho's around
Cause you the one and only
Only
You the one and only only (swear)
You thee only one for me for me (yeah)
You the one and only only (swear)
You thee only one for me for me
Night out on the town
Women on me
Mind on only one
Shit its getting deep
All we got is us
Haters salty
We making bitches jealous
Got the baddest on my team
Told them mother fuckers
Don't you focus on T
But I ain't mad at em
Cause its such a sight to see
Yo this is fucking loyalty
Always treat you like you royalty
Stay intimate if you into it
Killing it we suppose to be
Yo stick wit me I got us both
Stick wit me we rock the boat
Been back and forth coast to coast
But ain't nobody even come close
Different women different towns
All these ho's shut em down
Cause you the one and only
Yah yah
Ladies tryna make they rounds
I don't let them ho's around
Cause you the one and only
Only
You the one and only, only (swear)
You thee only one for me for me (yeah)
You the one and only, only (swear)
You the only one for me, for me
You thee only one, i swear that you thee only one
You're irreplaceable
Sensational
You're all I want
An angel on earth
Way more than I deserve
Thank god for the blessing
Now I've ended my search
Always put you first
No worries babe
See these bitches they thirst
I throw them shade
They try and I swerve
Won't take ya place
I'm a man of my word
Mean what I say
You and I we got a bond that no one can break
You and I we got a love that I never would trade
You make me feel a way words can't explain
I can get lost in your eyes girl you're my escape
Different women, different towns
All these ho's shut em down
Cause you the one and only
Yah yah
Ladie tryna make they rounds
I don't let them ho's around
Cause you the one and only
Only
You the one and only, only (swear)
You the only one for me, for me (yeah)
You the one and only, only (swear)
You thee only one for me, for me
