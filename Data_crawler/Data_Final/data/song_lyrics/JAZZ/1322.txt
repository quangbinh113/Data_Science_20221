Song Name: Not Enough
How do you play by the rules?
The rules are made by fools
Ignition start, let me drive
Let's ride to a place where everybody hides
Why you still complain?
I gave even my brain
Isn't it enough?
Why you don't love?
How could you put someone above?
Am I not enough?
You told your mama that you don't feel good
But we both know, that it's not the truth
You make your stories, your lies I can't stand
I left you to have something to regret
Why you still complain?
I gave even my brain
Isn't it enough?
Why you don't love?
How could you put someone above?
Am I not enough?
