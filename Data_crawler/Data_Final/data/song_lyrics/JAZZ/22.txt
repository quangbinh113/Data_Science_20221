Song Name: Second Time
We were playing twenty one
In the pitch black of a country night
I was struck like a drum
And I rolled my eyes trying to sit tight
I was dangerously tangled, second time I met you
And now I'm so impatient to adore you
I crashed my car last night
We were drinking warm wine
From paper cups that we left outside
God, I wished you were mine
As your skin light up in the sunrise
I was dangerously tangled, second time I met you
Now I'm so impatient to adore you
I crashed my car last night
So dangerously tangled, second time I met you
Now I'm so impatient to adore you
I crashed my car last night
