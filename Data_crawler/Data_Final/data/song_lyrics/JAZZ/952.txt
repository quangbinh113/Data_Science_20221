Song Name: Fire
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Darling
I feel no pain
My girl
Don't ever change
Charming
I like you here

Falling
I have no fear

Fire, ooh, I say

Fire, ooh, I say

Darling
You call my name

I like
The games you play

Charming
My love for you

Burning
I feel it too

Fire, ooh, I say
Fire, ooh, I say

Fire, ooh, I say
Fire, ooh, I say
