Song Name: Round Around - Jojo Effect Remix
You sat in blue jeans on rooftops, yeah
Waiting for answers like who we are
Raising an eyebrow
In a special position
My body shivers when you're taking my hand, yeah
My body shivers when you're taking my hand
Like the way you turn me around
I like the way
Like the way you turn me around
Let's do it round and round
Round like this. Round like this
You're pressing start when you look at me
I'm pressing start when I'm thinking
Of your little eyeroll
In a special position
You sat in blue jeans on rooftops, yeah
Waiting for answer like who we are
Raising an eyebrow
In a special position
My body shivers when you're taking my hand, yeah
My body shivers when you're taking my hand
Like the way you turn me around
I like the way
Like the way you turn me around
Let's do it round and round
Round like this, round like this
Like the way you turn me around
I like the way
Like the way you turn me around
Let's do it round and round
Round like this, round like this
Round like this
Like the way you turn me around
I like the way
Like the way you turn me around
Let's do it round and round
Round like this, round like this
Like the way you turn me around
I like the way
Like the way you turn me around
Let's do it round and round
Round like this, round like this
