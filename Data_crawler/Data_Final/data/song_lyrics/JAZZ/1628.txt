Song Name: But Not For Me - Vocal Version
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
