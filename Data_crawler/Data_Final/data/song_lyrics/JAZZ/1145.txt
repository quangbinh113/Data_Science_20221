Song Name: Heart Afire
Nightmares creep while you and me repeat
This bittersweet heat is suffocating
I'm waiting, and always hesitating
Kryptonite desires set my heart afire
Heart on fire, set my heart afire, yeah
With crimson secrets and forbidden bliss
Can't stay still, don't stop the thrill
My bones crave your skin, temptation within
Mistakes ignite the silence
Nightmares creep while you and me repeat
This bittersweet heat is suffocating
I'm waiting, and always hesitating
Kryptonite desires set my heart afire
Heart on fire, set my heart afire, yeah
Connect the dots straight to the start of intoxicating want
Lingering touch, these soft words whispered in the dark
Set my heart afire
