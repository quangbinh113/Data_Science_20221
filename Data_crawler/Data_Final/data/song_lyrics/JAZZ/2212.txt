Song Name: You're My Thrill
You? re my thrill
You do something to me
You send thrills right through me
When I look at you,? cause you're my thrill
You? re my thrill
How my thoughts embrace you
I just want to face you
When I look at you and you're my thrill
Oh, oh, nothing seems to matter
Oh, oh, here? s my heart on a silver platter
Where? s my will?
Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher
When I look at you I can't keep still
? Cause you're my thrill
[Piano]Oh, oh, nothing seems to matter
Oh, oh, here? s my heart on a silver platter
Where? s my will?
Why this strange desire
