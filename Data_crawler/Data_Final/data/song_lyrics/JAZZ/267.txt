Song Name: Talk
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing, but you always got me into deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
Everything you say make me look the other way
I don't wanna know so I'ma let it fade
Baby I got issues but I love myself
(Baby I got issues but I love myself)
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing but you always got me into deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Used to be the lowest, now I'm up
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I-I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I-I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing but you always got me into deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh na-na-na don't you talk to me, talk to me
Used to be the lowest, now I'm up
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me
Saying you can talk to me however you like
I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I-I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I-I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk to me
But I like the way you talk to me, talk to me
