Song Name: Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most - Demo
Once I was a sentimental thing
Threw my heart away each spring
But now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
And all I've got to show is a splinter for my little fling
Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that never left the post
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most
Mornings kiss wakes trees and flowers
And to them I'd like to drink a toast
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most
All winter long those birds they twitter twit
I know the song, this is love, this is it!
Heard it before and I know the score
And I've decided that spring is a bore
Doctors once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
That didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most
I am all alone, the party is over
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most
