Song Name: I Get A Kick Out Of You
My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything
Leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face (talking about me?)
I get no kick from Champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true, mmm, yeah
I get a kick out of you (me?)
Some may go from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky is my idea of nothing to do

Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a whirl
I get a kick out of you
Get my kicks out of you
