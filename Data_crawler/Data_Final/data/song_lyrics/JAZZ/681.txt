Song Name: Wearing Out My Shoes
Strangely happy where I am, yet wonder what could be
It's not a case of needing more, or wanting to be free
I could go and just explore, sail the seven seas
And know that I'd find nothing more, come back on my knees...
If I stay she goes, if I go she stays
But then if I go, she'll probably leave anyway
No way I can win, if I win I lose
But then if she wanders, she'll be wearing out my shoes
She'll be wearing out my shoes.
She'll be wearing out my shoes.
What I need is here and now, that's what's good for me
Keep me always guessing, caught me unexpectedly
Light the fire, warm inside, blowing from within
Together now we could go far, together travelling...
If I stay she goes, if I go she stays
But then if I go, she'll probably leave anyway
No way I can win, if I win I lose
But then if she wanders, she'll be wearing out my shoes
She'll be wearing out my shoes.
She'll be wearing out my shoes.
If I stay she goes, if I go she stays
But then if I go, she'll probably leave anyway
No way I can win, if I win I lose
But then if she wanders, she'll be wearing out my shoes
Strangely happy where I am, yet wonder what could be
It's not a case of needing more, or wanting to be free
I could go and just explore, sail the seven seas
And know that I'd find nothing more, come back on my knees...
If I stay she goes, if I go she stays
But then if I go, she'll probably leave anyway
No way I can win, if I win I lose
But then if she wanders, she'll be wearing out my shoes
If I stay she goes, if I go she stays
But then if I go, she'll probably leave anyway
No way I can win, if I win I lose
But then if she wanders, she'll be wearing out my shoes
