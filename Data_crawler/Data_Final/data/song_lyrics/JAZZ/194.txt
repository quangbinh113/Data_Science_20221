Song Name: Shower
I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feelin' like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feelin' as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you, baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
'Cause I can't get you out my mind
Think of you when I'm goin' to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
All I want, all I need is your lovin'
Baby, you make me hot like an oven
Since you came you know what I discovered?
Baby, I don't need me another
No, no all I know (know)
Only you got me feelin' so (so)
And you know that I got to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go
Think of you when I'm goin' to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da (yeah)
Singing in the shower (woah, oh)
There ain't no guarantee
But I'll take a chance on we
Baby, let's take our time
(Singing in the shower)
And when the times get rough
There ain't no givin' up
'Cause it just feels so right
(Singing in the shower)
Don't care what others say
If I got you, I'm straight
You bring my heart to life, yeah
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well, you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da (hey)
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
You got me singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
