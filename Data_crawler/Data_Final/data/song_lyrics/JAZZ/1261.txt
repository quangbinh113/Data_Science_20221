Song Name: Be Mine
And I want you to be mine
Stand up in the club
Come on, let's go
She want me to come
He want me to go
And if you wanna fight
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Stand up in the club
Come on, let's go
And I want you to come
I won't let you go
So if you wanna dance
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Yeah, I want you to be mine
Yeah, I want you to be mine
Stand up in the club
Come on, let's go
She want me to come
He want me to go
And if you wanna fight
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Stand up in the club
Come on, let's go
And I want you to come
I won't let you go
So if you wanna dance
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Yeah, I want you to be mine (mine, mine...)
Yeah, I want you to be mine
(Can you feel? Ain't it special? And it's real)
(Even if just for the night, impress me)
Yeah, I want you to be mine
