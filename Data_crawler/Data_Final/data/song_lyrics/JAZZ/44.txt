Song Name: Autumn's Song
Have you been outside lately?
Those leaves sure are changin'
Reminds me of that time we spent hours carvin' faces
Making jack-o-lanterns light up in the night
It's an image that's ingrained inside my mind
Well that year spent waiting
Walking empty pavement
I got by just fine
Didn't notice what was vacant
Now the fallin' leaves that echo out your name
Fill the space of you the same
I'm still fallin' out of love with you
And I'm headin' for the door
Not sure if I'll go through
Memories they take so long to erase
Will they ever even start to fade?
When the nights get cold
Sometimes when I look over
I see you by a fire with your hands out in the open
And I wonder if you're singing Autumn's song
Or if I'm singing all alone
I must be singing on my own
I'm still fallin' out of love with you

And I'm headin' for the door
Not sure if I'll go through
Memories they take so long to erase
Will they ever even start to fade?
I'm on my way
Just not today
