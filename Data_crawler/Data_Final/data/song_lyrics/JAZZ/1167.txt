Song Name: Sorry Ain't Enough
Can you forgive your people?
They're just hurting inside
If you look in the mirror
You will see it's just pride
Can you forgive your people?
They're just hurting inside
If you look in the mirror
You will see it's just pride
But sorry ain't enough
I get in my own way
But sorry ain't enough
(Sorry ain't enough)
I'm gonna scrap whatever you say
'Cause nobody can do it my way (No, no, no)
Throw it in the bin and light the coffin
I promise you I'll be everything (Ain't enough)
I'm gonna scrap whatever you say
'Cause nobody can do it my way (No, no, no)
Throw it in the bin and light the coffin
I promise you I'll be everything
I'm gonna scrap whatever you say
'Cause nobody can do it my way (No, no, no)
Throw it in the bin and light the coffin
I promise you I'll be everything
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be everything
Can you forgive your people?
They're just hurting inside
If you look in the mirror
You will see it's just pride
Can you forgive your people?
They're just hurting inside
If you look in the mirror
You will see it's just pride
(Pride, pride)
(Pride)
No, but sorry ain't enough (No, no, no)
I get in my own way, oh (Pride)
But sorry ain't enough (Yeah)
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
(Sometimes you gotta make them feel your thunder)
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
(It's cold outside)
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
In this broken place
How could you be so wise?
How could you be so wise?
Such a good thing
They don't know it's such a good thing
In this broken place
How could you be so wise?
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
(This one for you, so keep singing)
We rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise, we rise
