Song Name: Secret (2020 Version)
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear, this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket, takin' this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Why do you smile like you've been told a secret?
Now you're tellin' lies 'cause you swore to keep it
No one keeps a secret, no one keeps a secret
Why when we do our darkest deeds do we tell?
They burn in our brains, become a living hell
'Cause everybody tells, everybody tells
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear, this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket, takin' this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Look in my eyes, now you're getting sleepy
Are you hypnotized by secrets that you're keeping?
I know what you're keeping, I know what you're keeping
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear, this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket, takin' this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear, this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket, takin' this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
I'll keep it secret
Can keep it
I'll keep it secret
Can keep it
If one of them is dead
