Do you want to move my way?
Cause I move

Cause I move

Baby
See you looking over, my way oh I pretend as if it was the first
What's the problem did I Thank you
We saw this coming now you stay
Cause I move
I dance
I'll show you how to dance
Baby

I'll show you how to dance
Baby
Balla per me bimbo bimbo bimbo bianco
We wanna dance
But we're swimming in a black hole
Pretty girl in the red dress
Never thought this could be such a mess
Bimbo bian
Bimbo bianco
Bimbo bian
Bimbo bianco
Cause I move
