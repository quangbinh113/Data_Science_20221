Song Name: Heartbreak Anniversary
Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mm-mm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenir
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside, like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?

No
No-no-no
Ooh, nah
I'm building my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mm-mm
I'm foolishly patient (foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips (taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside, like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
Of me?
'Cause I think of you, think of you
