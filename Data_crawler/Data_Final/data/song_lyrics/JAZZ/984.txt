Song Name: Cherish
So tired of broken hearts, of losing at this game
Before I start this dance, I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please, take your aim at me
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy you keep bringing into my life
Oh, cherish your strength
You got the to power to make me feel good
Oh, baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide the need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy you keep bringing into my life
Baby, I cherish your strength
You got the to power to make me feel good
Oh, baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
Ooh you can't get away, I won't let you
Ooh you, I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love
Give it to me, boy, all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy you keep bringing into my life
Oh, cherish your strength
You got the to power to make me feel good
And I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
You are my destiny, I can't let go
Baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please, take your aim at me
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
I will always cherish you
I will always cherish you
I will always cherish you
