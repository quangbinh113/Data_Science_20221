Song Name: Be My Man
If I promise to be good
And do everything that I should
And be the best woman that I can
Will you promise to be my man
If I swear all my love to you
If I swear always to be true
To be the one that you'll know will understand
Will you promise to be my man
What on earth did I do to deserve
This little piece of heaven above
Where did you get the nerve
Are you trying to spoil me with you love
If I promise to be good
And do everything, everything that I should
You could make me the happiest woman in the land
If you promise to hold me tight
If you promise to treat me right
If you promise to be my man
To be my man...
