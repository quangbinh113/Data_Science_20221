Song Name: Just the Way You Are
Don't go changing
To try and please me
You never let me down before, mhm-mmh
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore...
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mhm-mmh
I took the good times
I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mhm-mmh
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I, don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mhm-mmh
I just want someone
That I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
Need to know that you will always be
Same old someone that I knew
Oh, what will it take 'til you believe in me?
The way that I believe in you
I said I love you that's forever
This I promise from the heart, mhm-mmh
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mhm-mmh
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
