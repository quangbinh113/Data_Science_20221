Song Name: Days of Wine and Roses
The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked nevermore that wasn't there before
The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of a golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
Days of wine and roses and you
