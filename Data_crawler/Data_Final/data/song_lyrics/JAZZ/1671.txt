Song Name: Exactly Like You
I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you
Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm scheming
Dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She made me for someone
Exactly like you
Exactly like you
Exactly like you
Make me feel so grand
I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm scheming
Dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She made me for someone
Exactly like you
