Song Name: If I Had You
I could show the world how to smile I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue if I had you
If I had you by my side, baby I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind I could start my life all a new
If I had you
I could climb a snow-capped mountain swim the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert if I had you by my side
I could be the Queen yes the Queen, uncrowned
I'd be Humble or poor, rich or renowned there is nothin' I couldn't do
Lord if I had you
I could climb the snow-capped mountain sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burnin' desert if I had you by my side
I could be a Queen dear uncrowned humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I wouldn't do if I had you by my side
Say that ain't nothing I would do if I had you
