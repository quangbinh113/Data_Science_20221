Song Name: Hard For Me
You keep telling me that I am free to go
But I'm addicted to you
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie
When I'm not here, you're alone
Can you walk by your own?
Don't you lie
Don't you lie
Don't you lie
And I think you should know
That I won't let it go
It was like a million times
I'm singing a lullaby
And I think you should know
That I won't let it go
I thought that it was enough
But I don't wanna say goodbye
And I think you should know
It was hard to say
Every minute that we spent together
Doesn't matter for you
It's a lie
It's a lie
You're a liar
Every time you wanna walk the door
I don't blame you
I don't blame you
And I think you should know
That I won't let go
It was like a million times
I'm singing a lullaby
And I think you should know
That I won't let you go
I thought that it was enough
But I don't wanna say goodbye
And I think you should know, oh, yeah
And I think you should know, oh yeah
Hard for me
Hard for me
It's hard for me
Hard for me
Hard for me
It's hard for me
Hard for me
Hard for me
It's hard for me
