Song Name: My Favorite Things
Raindrops on roses
Whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles
Warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings
These are a few of my
Favorite things
Cream-colored ponies
Crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells
Roti, maduros
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
People in dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver-white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the bias bites
When the system stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
Bad
When the bias bites
When the system stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel
So bad
Bad
