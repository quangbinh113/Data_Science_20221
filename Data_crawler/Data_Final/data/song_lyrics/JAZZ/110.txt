Song Name: this is what heartbreak feels like
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Yes, I feel like I'm choking
Breaking up 'cause we already broken
Snake emoji on my phone when you calling
'Cause our love doesn't feel like falling
When I cry myself to sleep
I see you in my dreams
I can't breathe
'Bouta hyperventilate
Hiding your phone when you're sleeping
Staying out late on the weekend
Deep down I knew you were cheating
But I didn't wanna believe it
I'm busy fighting my demons, you were so deceiving
Messing with my feelings
You were my Garden of Eden
Now I'm leaving
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me, girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
