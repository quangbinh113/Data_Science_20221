Song Name: Jump for Joy - 2007 Remaster
Fare thee well, land of cotton
Cotton lisle is out of style
Honey chile
Jump for joy
Don't you grieve, little Eve. All the hounds
I do believe, have been killed.
Ain'tcha thrilled?
Jump for joy
Have you seen pastures groovy?
Green Pastures was just a technicolor movie
When you start up to heaven
And you meet, yeah, old St. Pete
Tell that boy to please
Jump for Joy.
Step right in, give Pete some skin
And jump for joy.
Cotton lisle is out of style
Honey chile
Jump for joy
All the hounds
I do believe, yes, have been killed.
Ain'tcha thrilled?
Jump for joy
Have you seen pastures groovy?
Green Pastures was just a technicolor movie
When you start up to heaven
And you meet old St. Pete
Tell that boy, please
Jump for Joy.
Step right in, give Pete some skin
And jump for joy.
