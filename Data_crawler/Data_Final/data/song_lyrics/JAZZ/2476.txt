Song Name: Sunshine
I've been a lot of places
I've seen so many things
But everything looks new
When you are near
I've kissed a lot of faces
I've had my share of flings
But none of them compared to loving you, my dear
Sunshine, (sunshine)
Sunshine, (sunshine)
Sunshine, (sunshine)
You are my sunshine
You set my life on fire,
(Set my life on fire)
You changed my very face
Love, you make me feel like I can fly
You make me feel much higher,
(You make me feel much higher)
Than a joker or an ace
Move over stars and let me share God
Sunshine, (sunshine)
Sunshine, (sunshine)
Sunshine, (sunshine)
You are my sunshine
You are my sunshine
