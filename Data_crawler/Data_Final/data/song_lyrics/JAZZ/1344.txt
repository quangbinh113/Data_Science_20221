Song Name: Melt
What'll be will be
What you say it always goes and in the end
In the end you always get what you want
Baby I try too much
I'm living without your love again
But I'll never stop trying
Well let me know
If you would ever love me I can show
The way your body should be, should be touched
Should be held, let me watch your body melt into mine
Down the line
What'll be will be
What you say it always goes and in the end
In the end you always get what you want
Baby I try too much
I'm living without your love again
But I'll never stop
Well let me know
If you would ever love me I can show
The way your body should be, should be touched
Should be held, let me watch your body melt into mine
Down the line
I don't know when to stop
How much further to the top
I don't know if I can climb
It's getting steep, I fall behind
Well let me know
If you would ever love me I can show
The way your body should be, should be touched
Should be held, let me watch your body melt into mine
Down the line
If you would ever love me I can show
The way your body should be
Should be touched
Should be held
Let me watch your body melt into mine
Down the line
