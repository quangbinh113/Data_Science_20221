Song Name: I Will Always Love You
If I 
Should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go
But I know
That I'll think of you every step of the way
And I 
Will always love you
I'll always love you
You 
My darling you, hmm
Bittersweet 
Memories
That is all I am taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
And I hope 
Life will treat you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish you joy
And happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I 
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
And I
Will always love you
Oh, I'll always love you
I'll keep on loving you
Wuoh, I'll always love you
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
I'll love you with all my heart
I'll always love you
