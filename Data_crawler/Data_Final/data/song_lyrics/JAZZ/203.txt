Haha, get Jazzy on 'em
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First-class seat on my lap, girl, riding comfortable (oh yeah)
Ha 'cause I know what the girl them need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get Jazzy on 'em
You know the words to my songs, no habla inglés (oh)
Our conversations ain't long, but you know what is
I know what the girl them want, London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one
Been around the world, don't speak the language (uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explaining (uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is (uh-huh) when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Uno: met a friend in Rio
Dos: she was all on me-o
Tres: we could ménage à three-o
Cuatro, oh, yeah (2 Chainz)
Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis (ooh)
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck (Deck)
Chest to chest, tongue on neck (neck)
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat (Yeah)
Bought a jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy so good I bought her a pet (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me (You do)

Talk dirty to me (Talk to me)
