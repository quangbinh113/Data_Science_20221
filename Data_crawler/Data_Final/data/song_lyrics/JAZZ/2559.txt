Song Name: P.S. I Love You
Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you
Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you
Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you, love you, love you
