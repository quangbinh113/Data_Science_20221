Song Name: Stars Fell On Alabama
We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
I can't forget the glamor
Your eyes held a tender light
While stars fell on Alabama
Last night
I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me
My heart beat like a hammer
My arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
