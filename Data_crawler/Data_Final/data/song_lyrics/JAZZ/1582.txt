Song Name: Someday My Prince Will Come
Someday my prince will come
Someday I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams come to me
He'll whisper, 'I love you'
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away, I'll find my love some day
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday my prince will come
Someday I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams come to me
He'll whisper, 'I love you'
Then he'll steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away, I'll find my love some day
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday, yes, my prince, he's gonna come
Someday
