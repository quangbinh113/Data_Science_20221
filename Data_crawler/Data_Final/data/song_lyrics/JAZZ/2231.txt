Song Name: Almost Blue
Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost
All the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
Almost touching
It will almost do
There's a part of me that's always true
Always
All the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost you
Almost me
Almost blue
