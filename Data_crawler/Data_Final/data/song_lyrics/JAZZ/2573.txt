Song Name: Love Me Or Leave Me
This suspense is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainty
Tell me now I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or to go
Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the night time the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else
There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give back tomorrow
For your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else
There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and to give back tomorrow
Your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else
