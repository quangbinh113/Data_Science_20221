Song Name: I Loves You Porgy - 2013 Remastered Version
I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me, I want to stay here
With you forever and I'd be glad
Yes, I loves you Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me with his hot hands
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here
With you forever, I've got my man
I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me, I want to stay here
With you forever, I've got my man
Someday, I know he's comin' to call me
He's goin' handle me and hold me so
It's going to be like dyin', Porgy
When he calls me
But when he calls I know I'll have to go
I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Honey, don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me, I want to stay here
With you forever, I've got my man
