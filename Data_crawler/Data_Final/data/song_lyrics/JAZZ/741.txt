Song Name: Into My Soul
I took a trip to the mountains
I saw you trapped up in the cable-way
I prayed that you would fall
And come floating down to me, oh yeah
You fall free style
You down from the sky
Oh i've been waiting
I've been waiting
I say leap into my arms, babe
C'mon dive into my soul
C'mon jump into my heart, babe
C'mon dive into my soul
I say leap into my arms, babe
C'mon dive into the snow
C'mon jump into my bob-sled
C'mon dive into my soul
Does it have to start right now
When you were almost ready
When you were almost ready
To leap from the sky down to me
Throwing your future into the wind, fearless
C'mon leap down from the sky
Down here by my side
Oh i've been waiting
You know that i've been waiting
I say leap into my arms, babe
C'mon dive into my soul
C'mon jump into my heart, babe
C'mon dive into my soul
I say leap into my arms, babe
C'mon dive into the snow
C'mon jump into my bob-sled
C'mon dive into my soul
I say don't look back, look back
I say don't look back, look back
