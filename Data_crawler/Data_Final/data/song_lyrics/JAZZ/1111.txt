Song Name: Keep The Faith
Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son
(Everybody needs somebody to love) mother, mother
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) please believe me
(Everybody's bitching 'cause they don't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on
(Faith!) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
Tell me baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride?
Yeah!
(Everybody needs somebody to love) mother, father
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) please don't leave me
(Everybody's bleeding 'cause the times are tough)
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on
(Faith!) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you know it's never too late?
Right now we've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh, we've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we got to keep the faith
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I've been walking in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Trying to wash away this pain
Mother, father (everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase (everybody needs somebody to hate)
Every night we fall from grace (everybody's bitching 'cause they don't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face (everybody needs)
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on (everybody, keep the faith)
(Faith!) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, you've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Try to hold on, trying to hold on, yeah
(Faith!) Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Everybody keep the faith
(Faith!) Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Faith!) (Everybody needs somebody to love)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
(Faith!) (Everybody needs somebody to love)
(Everybody needs)
(Everybody, keep the faith) (faith!)
