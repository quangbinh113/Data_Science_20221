Song Name: 642 Ways
There's lilies
That are flying
In the sky while I dreamt of you
I was sleeping
Ever soundly
By your side, oh, my sweet, sweet honeydew
When moons start to change
The seasons fade
I'll always be true
And thinking of you, it makes my heart stand still
Whenever I feel that I am so lonely
I always know and always knew
There are 642 ways that I love you
There are 642 ways that I want you

When days are too tough
And life gets too rough
There's only one thing that I need
It's when you are holding me close
There are 642 ways that I love you
There are 642 ways that I need you
When days are too tough
And life gets too rough
There's only one thing that I need
It's when you are holding me close
It's when you're holding me close
To you
