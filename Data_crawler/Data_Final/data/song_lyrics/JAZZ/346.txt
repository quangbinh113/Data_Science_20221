Song Name: Six Days - Remix
I get a feeling there's gonna be a riot

I don't read the newspapers because they all have f- ugly prints
Tag me up
Tch, tag me up (bring it on)
Bring it on
Bring it on 'cause there's gon' be shit tonight!
At the starting of the week
At summit talks, you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late (come, come, come, come, come with it)
(Come, come, come, come, come with it)
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday (what time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fools' Day (what time is it?)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another (bomb)
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another- (bomb)
Fire, you go, go shot
Escalation
Never Station
Generation
Separation
Situation
Dissipation
Shot!
Another shot, another shot the tender vessel pressure pop
The heart is cold, the gun is hot (shot)
I'm not sure if they done or not
I'm not sure that they wanna stop
The gun is cold, the blood is hot (shot) (shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot)
The hearts are weak, the guns are not
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (what time is it?)
You feel the shaking on the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (What time is it?)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tryna be smart
Get tomorrow on the phone
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late (I need to see tomorrow)
Tryna reach tomorrow
Think tomorrows come I think it's too late
Another day!
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on 'cause there's gon' be shit tonight!
