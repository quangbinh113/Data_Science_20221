Song Name: What A Diff'rence A Day Made
What a diff'rence a day made
24 little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Mmm, where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine
Lord, what a diff'rence a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a diff'rence a day made
And the difference is you
