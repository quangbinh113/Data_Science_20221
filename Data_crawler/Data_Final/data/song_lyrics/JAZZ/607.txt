Song Name: Nothing Compares 2 U
It's Been Seven Hours And Fifteen Days
Since You Took Your Love Away.
I Go Out Every Night And Sleep All Day
Since You Took Your Love Away.
Since You've Been Gone I Can Do Whatever I Want.
I Can See Whoever I Choose.
I Can Eat My Dinner In A Fancy Restaurant.
But Nothing,
I Said Nothing, Can Take Away These Blues,
'Cause Nothing Compares,
Nothing Compares To You.
It's Been So Lonely Without You Here,
Like A Bird Without A Song.
Nothing Can Stop These Lonely Tears From Falling.
Tell Me, Baby, Where Did I Go Wrong?
I Could Put My Arms Around Every Boy I See,
But They'd Only Remind Me Of You.
I Went To The Doctor, Guess What He Told Me,
Guess What He Told Me?
He Said, Girl, You'd Better Have Fun,
No Matter What You Do,
But He's A Fool.
'Cause Nothing Compares,
Nothing Compares To You.
All The Flowers That You Planted, Mamma,
In The Backyard,
All Died When You Went Away.
I Know That Living With You, Baby, Was Sometimes Hard.
But I'm Willing To Give It Another Try
'Cause Nothing Compares,
Nothing Compares To You
