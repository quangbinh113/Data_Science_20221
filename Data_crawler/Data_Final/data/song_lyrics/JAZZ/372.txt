Song Name: 24/7
Can we just sit down, have a little conversation?
Yeah, I wanna talk it out 'cause I'm all up in my feelings
I never felt this before and I just wanna feel some more
We used to keep it casual, now I wanna just be yours
Can we sit down, try to have a little conversation?
See you got me all in my head
Every day with you is like the weekend
I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to, yeah
'Cause 24/7 I'm thinking about you
24/7 I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about you
Staring at the clock, how'd I get so damn impatient?
I know you just left, but I'm missing you like crazy
I usually don't get this far, always cut 'em off before
My heart gets in too deep, I'ma let you in too deep
Now tell me, how's that for a little motivation?
See you got me all in my head
Every day with you is like the weekend
I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to, yeah
'Cause 24/7 I'm thinking about you
24/7 I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (thinking about you, oh-oh)
You, you, you, you (no, oh-oh)
24/7 I'm thinking about you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I've been thinking about you
You have me still thinking about you, oh my
Thinking about you, about you, oh-oh
See you got me all in my head
And every day with you is like the weekend
I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to (I'll try, I'll try)
'Cause 24/7 I'm thinking about you
24/7 I'm thinking about you, ooh
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (you)
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (you)
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (you, you, you)
You, you, you, you
24/7 I'm thinking about you
