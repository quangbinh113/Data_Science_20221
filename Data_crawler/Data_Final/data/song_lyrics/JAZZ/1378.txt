Song Name: Again (with The Mellomen)
Again,
This couldn't happen
Again
This is that once
In a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more,
This never happened
Before
Though I have prayed
For a lifetime
That such as you
Would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold
As I'm holding you now
And yet never so near
Mine to have
When the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for
When
This doesn't happen
Again
We'll have this moment
Forever
But never, never
Again (never, never)
We'll have this moment
Forever
But never, never
Again (never, never)
