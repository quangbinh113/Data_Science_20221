Song Name: Free as a Bird (Tom Fire Version)
Who are you who I see standing smiling across the room
Who are you? That I see with a rose that is in full bloom
Do you want to know want to know the deal
I've got only one heart to hear
Oh only one to steer
Oh how you make me feel
Free as a bird
I know what I'd heard
Free as a wind
The wind
Sometimes I feel like my head on the chopper
Now I wanna tell you how do it proper
Heart under arrest like a criminal copper
Driving lady crazy put my head on the blocker
Sing into my ear do it clear I never stop
Get caught by the raindrops you got the lot
For life I might like a nightlight on
Baby you and me we take it to the top
I'll be waiting for you like a leaf after the fall
Waiting for you to call
And I'll be waiting until the sun comes up
Your love is like the wind
Even though I don't see where it ends or begins
I see the tree it felled
In the garden
Free as a bird
Free as a wing
Don't you dare lose my number, don't forget
Don't forget where I love
And I'll be there when the end comes
When the end comes
Free as a bird
Free as the wind
Free as the love within
