Song Name: Call Me When You Hear This Song
Call me when you hear this song
I think you know who you are
Can we start where we left off?
Lord knows I'm never moving on
Every time you hear this tune
Just know I still think of you
Can we get together soon
So you can say I love you too?
Please not again
We've been through this before my friend
Don't say that this is the last time
No I ain't ready for goodbye
I tried my best
And gave you everything I had
Seems what I have is not enough
You want another kind of love
Call me when you hear this song
I think you know who you are
Can we start where we left off?
Lord knows I'm never moving on
Every time you hear this tune
Just know I still think of you
Can we get together soon
So you can say I love you too?
You're being pulled in another direction
I want you to know that I understand
Cause things get complicated when you say you still love me
But how can I know how you feel I'm only a man
I won't stand in your way
You deserve to know yourself
I know we'll meet again one day
But till' then I just wanna say (I just wanna say)

Call me when you hear this song
I think you know who you are
Can we start where we left off?
Lord knows I'm never moving on
Every time you hear this tune
Just know I still think of you
Can we get together soon
So you can say I love you too?
