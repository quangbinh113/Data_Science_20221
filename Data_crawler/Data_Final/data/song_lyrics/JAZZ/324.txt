Song Name: in heat.
Feel the air
Feel the tension that lies beneath
Hold your tongue
Don't you cry, just listen to me
You know my touch and you want it so vigorously
Your hips don't lie, come inside, and follow my lead
Yeah, you work it, girl, you work it
Know you're burning, I see the urges
Yeah, you work it, girl you work it
Know you're burning, you're so perfect
Don't get lost, yeah, you know the cost, yeah
I hold my cross, yeah, I'm such a loss, yeah
Just cut me off, yeah, I've had enough, yeah
I'm outta luck, yeah, I wanna run, yeah
Time is fading away
There's no escape
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, I'll run
Feel the air
Feel the tension that lies beneath
Hold your tongue
Don't cry, just listen to me
You know my touch and you want it so vigorously
Your hips don't lie, come inside and follow my lead
Yeah, you work it, girl, you work it
Know you're burning, I see the urges
