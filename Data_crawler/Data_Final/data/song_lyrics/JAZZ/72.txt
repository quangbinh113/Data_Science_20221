Song Name: I Just Couldn't Save You Tonight (feat. Aur√©lie) - Story of Kale - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Living with something that I couldn't see
And somehow fade internally
If you came a long way to get to know me
And maybe it's just meant to be
Come here, I just found a new recipe
The flower, the bricks and the sea
My intuition says you will like me
And I don't know where should I be
And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care, it's taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
Falling in love is a new world for me
Do you wanna be my company
From thousands of miles you will like gettin' here
No need, no anniversary
And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care, it's taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care, it's taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care, it's taking me apart
And I just couldn't save you tonight
I just couldn't save you tonight
And I just couldn't save you tonight
