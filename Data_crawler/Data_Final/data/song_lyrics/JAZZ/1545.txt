Song Name: I'm Dreamin'
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
If I'm dreaming
Then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
Just leave me on my own
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I can't get over
The fact that I'm with you
Now that I have you
I don't know what to do
Girl, if I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout you
About the things
That I like to do
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you
If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I've been waiting for such a long time
For you to say that you would be mine
Now that you're here, here by my side
I can't control the way that I feel inside
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you
If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
Don't wake me up 'cause clean cuts dreaming
Anytime I sleep my mind keeps scheming
I heard she has a man, I said, "So what?"
She be looking sweeter than a honey dipped donut
I wanna taste her, straight no chaser
We could do the sound if not a date or later
Front to back in the sac I keep it scheming
For you girl, I'm feigning, girl, you got me dreaming
If I'm dreaming about you
Let's make this dream true
If I'm dreaming about you
Let's make this dream of love come true
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you
If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep (just let me sleep)
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
If I'm dreaming
Then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
This dream is just
Just you and me
If I'm dreaming (ooh-hoo)
I can't sleep, dreaming about you
(Dreaming, dreaming)
If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
If I'm dreaming
If I'm dreaming
If I'm dreaming
