Song Name: Black & White
Should I gather all the pieces
To the puzzle of my life?
Should I let bygones be bygones
Take what's left and make it right?
Why not take it at face value?
See the picture black and white
My night vision's kind of blurry
I'll try
Get out of my way, get out of my way
From the beginning to the now
We done come a long way
(I see the world in black and white)
I just wanna get higher (higher)
Set the city on fire (fire)
Body all on my back
Won't have it no other way
(Won't have it no other way)
Should I savor every moment
Like we're running out of time?
Should I let bygones be bygones
Just to ease each other's minds?
Why not take it at face value?
See the picture black and white
My night vision's kind of blurry
But I'll try
Get out of my way (get out of my way)
Get out of my way (I see the world in black and white)
From the beginning to the now (beginning to the now)
We done come a long way (come a long way)
I just wanna get higher (higher)
Set the city on fire (fire)
Body all on my back
Won't have it no other way
(Won't have it no other way)
I see the world in black and white
I see the world in black and white
I see the world in black and white
I see the world in black and white
