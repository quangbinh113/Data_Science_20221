Song Name: Thirteen Sad Farewells
You've been seeing me
Through your grown up eyes and your sweet disguise
And you've been running free
With your lullabies and those same old lies
Darling I should've said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
Now I can't bear to see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells
You've been seeing her
With her pretty eyes
And her lovely lies
And I've been waiting here
I've been killing time
Hoping you will be mine
Darling I should've said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
Now I can't better see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
You will see me no more darling
You have used all your farewells
You have used all your farewells
You have used all your farewells
