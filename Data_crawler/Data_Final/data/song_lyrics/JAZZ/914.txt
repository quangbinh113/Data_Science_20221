Song Name: All I want
Oh she is watching me
And her eyes they flow
With fond and tender pain
I know, time laid out a road
We have walked alone
And yet we meet again
Now I know finally
I've never been alone
I just couldn't see
That like, the swirling of the sea
Lies a mystery
Brings me back to you
Oh, we put round our world
Chains that we denied
Yes we dreamed that we
Were free, and this was our downfall
With no place to go
We drift eternally
Now, I know finally
I've never been alone
I just couldn't see
That like the swirling of the sea
Lies a mystery
Brings me back to you
Brings me back to you
Brings me back to see
Brings me back to all the things I've lost along the way
All I want to know (now, I know)
All I want to see (finally)
I've never been alone (I've never been alone)
'Cause I just couldn't see
(Now I know finally) 'Cause I want you
(I've never been alone) 'Cause I want you
(I just couldn't see) 'Cause I feel you
Oh baby I want you (now, I know finally)
'Cause I want you (I've never been alone)
'Cause I feel you (I just couldn't see)
'Cause now I know (now I know finally)
(I've never been alone) Finally
(I just couldn't see) Finally
And I know, I know, I know, I know finally
I know, I know, I know, I know finally
(I just couldn't see)
