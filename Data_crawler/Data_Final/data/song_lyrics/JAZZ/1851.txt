Song Name: You Belong To Me
See the pyramids along the Nile
And watch the sunrise on the tropic isle
But just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the market place, in old Algiers
And send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember, darling, 'til you're home again
That you belong to me...
