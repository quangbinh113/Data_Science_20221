Song Name: Thing For You (Don Diablo Remix) - Extended
Always stay when the night is done
You've got the kinda thing I should run from
But that's the reason why it's so fun
I always come back
Sending all the wrong signals to my brain (ooh)
Sending all the right feelings through my veins
I should go, but I never walk away
Always make the same mistakes, no, I never change
I got a thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings, I do
'Cause I got a thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings, I do, 'cause I got a-
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Help with things I don't tryna fix
But I think I like all my dirty habits
Maybe I'm a little too used to it
'Cause I always come back
Sending all the wrong signals to my brain (ooh)
Sending all the right feelings through my veins
I should go, but I never walk away
Always make the same mistakes, no, I never change
I got a thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings, I do, 'cause I got a-
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
Thing for you, thing, thing for you
