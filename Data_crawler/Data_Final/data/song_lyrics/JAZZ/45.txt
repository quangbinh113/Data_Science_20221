Song Name: Flying to LA
Pretty bird
You just crossed my way
And I know it's 'cause you're flying away
But I kinda really want you to stay
Pretty bird
You had no time to see me
You were finally leaving the nest
I just wish I'd met you before the best
That I know is yet to come
Just tell me once you're done
I saw you briefly and I said "Hey"
But it was too late, 'cause you were flying to LA
Pretty bird
You just crossed my way
And I know it's 'cause you're flying away
But I kinda really want you to stay
Pretty bird
You had no time to see me
You were finally leaving the nest
I just wish I'd met you before the best
That I know is yet to come
Just tell me once you're done
I saw you briefly and I said "Hey"
But it was too late, 'cause you were flying to LA
