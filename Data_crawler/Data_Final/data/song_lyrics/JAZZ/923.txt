Song Name: Highway To Hell
Living easy, loving free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing that I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell, hell, hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Mmm I'm playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell, hell, hell
Don't stop me
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell, hell, hell
