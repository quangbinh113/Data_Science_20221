Song Name: Don't Wait
A friend indeed, come build me up
Come shed your light, it makes me shine
You get the message, don't you ever forget it
Let's laugh and cry until we die
If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you, I'd be on my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart, without a question
Don't wait for life (Hey)
I care for you, I talk to you
In my deepest dreams, I'm fortunate
We got a friendship, no one can contest it
And not to mention, I respect you with my all
If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to hold my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart, without a question
Don't wait for life
Not a thing in the world can get between what we share
No matter where you at, no worry, I'll be there
No one's got your back like I do
Even when business ain't going well, we still cool
When I shine, you shine, always on your side
All my life you'll have what's mine
Mark my word, we gon' be alright
My brother, my sister, we gon' be just fine (Hey)
(If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone)

(If it wasn't for you, I'd be on my own)
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life
