Song Name: She Knows (feat. Amber Coffman & Cults)
She knows, she knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (oh, I), run, run away, run away (oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back
Run, run away, run, run away (oh, I), run away (oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (well, alright)
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want? What you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, saying that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want
What she, what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just wanna sing on it
Got me up so high
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleeping
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
That she could be doing the same thing, I suppose
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Niggas say, "Turn up", hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say, "Turn up", hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)
Got me up so high, tryna get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, tryna get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, tryna get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, tryna get a piece of that apple pie
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well, alright
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
