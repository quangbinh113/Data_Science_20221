Song Name: All Night Long
I wanna rock you
All night long, baby
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
Let me know when you alone
Hit me up just so I know
That you're ready for me
Get ready for me
Baby, when I hit you up, just answer
Keep it on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friends yet
I love when you put your body on me
You could just be the one that I need
Where you wanna go, baby, let me know
Put your bet on me and don't doubt it
I don't get like this with nobody
I'll put it all on the line 'cause you got it
Let your guard down and, baby, open up
We can get it poppin', let me know wassup
Swear that I can't get enough
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
She deserve the finer things
So I buy her diamond rings
Anything she want it, don't matter what the cost
Show her what it feels when she fucking with a boss
Money ain't a thing to me
Baby, I can show you shit you won't believe (believe)
So hop in this whip and come ride with me, baby
We gon' ball out and be fucking like crazy
Sweat out that, Remy, you don't gotta trip
Girl, I'ma kiss you on both pair of lips
Oh-oh, they say you get what you deserve
Stay down with me, girl, I'm gon' show you your worth
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
You got me singing la di da da da
Love it when you get it going, don't stop
You put it down and I light it up
That's just the way that we rock
Yeah, I just wanna rock with you
All night long
(Like la di da da da)
I just wanna rock with you
All night long
Yeah, baby, you know I wanna rock you
Yeah, night long, yeah
Night long, baby
Night long, baby
Night long, baby
Night long, baby
Night long, baby
