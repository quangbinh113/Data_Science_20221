Song Name: To Love You All Over Again
A quiet room is what you get
An empty glass, an unmade bed
A picture window with a view
And all I think about is you
To feel so bad, to feel so good
To let it be misunderstood
Now I long to lose my senses
And love you all over again
The shouted words, the tired sighs
The traded kiss of sad goodbyes
The living off of our desires
Then putting out a thousand fires
To feel so bad, to feel so good
To let it be misunderstood
Now I'd tear down my defenses
To love you all over again
To know a place without regret
You make believe, you paid your debt
But in that clean and quiet room
You can't believe it's over yet
Out on a lark, at home asleep
The endings play, the bands retreat
But in that dumb luck of the few
The consolation comes to you
To feel so bad, to feel so good
The verdict's in, it's understood
I will be tried for my offenses
And love you all over again
Out on a spree, at home asleep
The endings play, the bands retreat
But in that dumb luck of the few
My consolation becomes you
To feel so bad, to feel so good
The verdict's in, it's understood
That I'll be tried for my offenses
And love you all over again
