Song Name: What Of Your Eyes
Look at the way all the stars intertwine
Like a kiss from your lips
If only you were mine
Heaven can resign for
Only heaven knows what I've been dreaming darling
What of your eyes
What do they tell me?
Do they sing lullabies or aim just to expel me?
What of your lips?
The sweetest kiss
Was I too bold to resist?
I admit I got lost in your iris
And what of the way
Our hands should mar the time?
What of your eyes?
Like stars that shine
And what of the dream
That we've been dreaming?
Don't you agree that a dream
Is only ever made for achieving
What of the way
You made me sigh?
Was I too bold to believe
To conceive in a future for you and I?
And what of the way
Our limbs should intertwine?
What of your eyes?
Like stars that shine
Est-ce qu'on deviendrait des vrais amants
Ou sommes-nous juste des Ã©toiles filantes
