Song Name: Maria Elegante (feat. Afro B)
Hm, yeah
(The best sound)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, yeah
Oh, na, no
Pull up looking very elegante (boom)
With a baby and her booty regante (regante)
She know that I be coming muy picante
See the shine, I get diamante
She tell me say she wine it, put it on me (on you)
I tell her, see I never leave her lonely (lonely)
My baby looking very elegante (hm), ah-ah
Cruising, two-door
If he want more, I spend more (ah)
Tell me your name before you go home
Baby, let me know
