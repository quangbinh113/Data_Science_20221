Song Name: Fair-Weather Friend
He could buy you a bed
But it won't help you sleep
He could give you a watch
But not his time to keep
He could fly you to Verona or a mountain in the snow
But he won't know the places that we used to go
I heard he's best friends with Hollywood now
And he can afford all the champagne in town
I heard he's got a big house up on easy street
But I've got a big heart that I want you to keep

My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
Don't you remember
The promise we made
As our shadows grew long
In the field where we lay
That you'd always be you
And I'd always be me
As the sun fell asleep
And so did we
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
I know it won't make you cry
