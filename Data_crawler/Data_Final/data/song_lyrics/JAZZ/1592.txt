Song Name: Long Ago And Far Away
Dreary days are over
Life's a four-leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago comes true
Long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed, you're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you
Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you
That all I longed for long ago was you
