Song Name: Wonderwall
Today is gonna to be the day
That they're gonna to throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall.
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Then maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
