Song Name: Dark Room
I feel the mess
Bubbling through me
But I don't care if you touch me now
She wanna dance until she's worn out
My baby, my mind isn't ready now
Baby, my mind is isn't ready now
Baby, my mind isn't ready now
Lady, tell me something
'Cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child
Love me, love me, love me now
Touch me, touch me, touch me now
Let me check inside of you, oh, yeah
The radio, the radio's about to explode
Oh baby, don't waste your time or our lives
The radio, the radio's about to explode
I have to have my dose now or I'll die
Got sweet lady
I look up in my eyes
Got sweet lady
I look up in my eyes
Got sweet lady
I look up in my eyes
Got sweet lady
I look up in my eyes
The radio, the radio's about to explode
Oh baby, don't waste your time or our lives
The radio, the radio's about to explode
I have to have my dose now or I'll die
Livin' in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room, yeah
Yeah, woah, yeah
Lady, tell me something
'Cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child
Lady, tell me something
'Cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child
Livin' in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room, yeah
Livin' in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room
