Song Name: Wishing Well
Kissing like a bandit stealing time
Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me
Slowly but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile tears. SING!
Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
Say I wanna be your midnight rambler
Quickly but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
I feel like going on
I feel like going on
Come on, come on
Erotic images float through my head
Your midnight rambler, baby
Take it
For you anywhere
I don't know I don't care
But all those years
I wanna be your midnight rambler, baby
