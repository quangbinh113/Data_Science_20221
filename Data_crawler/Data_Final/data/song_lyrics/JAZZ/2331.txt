Song Name: What a Little Moonlight Can Do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do - oo - oo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
You're in love
Your heart is a flutter
And all day long you only stutter
'Cause your poor heart just cannot utter
The words "I love you"
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do - oo - oo
Ooh, wait a while, till a moonbeam comes peepin' through
And you'll get bold, you can't resist him
And all you'll say once you have kissed him
Is ooh-ooh-ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Oh ba-dey oh ba-dey oh wey oh
Ooh-ooh
What a little moonlight can do - oo - oo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
Oh you're in love
Your heart is a flutter
And all day long you only stutter
'Cause your poor tongue just cannot utter
The words "I love you"
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight
What a little moonlight can do to you
Wait a while, till a moonbeam comes peepin' through
And you'll get bold, you can't resist him
And all you'll say once you have kissed him
Is ooh-ooh-ooh
What a little moonlight can do
When there's moonlight, there's madness
My heart fills with gladness
The very thought of you, a secret rendezvous
When I get you all alone in the moonlight
Feel your arms wrapped around me so tight
Ooh, your heartbeat making
Happy feet awaken and I'm taken
Outta my mind the day I met you
Over the moon and when I get you
A-way out of sight, well you can betcha
The pull of the moon is gonna getcha
A stolen moment's the sweetest little moment
Flop, zing! There go my heartstrings
Twiddly doo, twiddly dee, the moonlight plays tricks on me
Messing my mouth, messing my mind
Don't know what to say, my tongue's all tied
Tied up, it's alright
Hey! Whatcha gonna do?
Lips 'ain't good for nothing but kissing you
The taste of your sweetness, I feel it to my toes
Like chocolate eclair or a honeysuckle rose
The look of love is in your eye, well
Blame it on the moonlight
What a little moonlight can do
Ay
Ay
Ay
Wee up
Oh
Wee ya dup
Ay
Ay
Ooh way ooh way ooh way oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight
What a little moonlight can do to you
Wait a while, till a moonbeam comes peepin' through
And you'll get bold, you can't resist him
And all you'll say once you have kissed him
Is ooh-ooh-ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
What a little moonlight can do
To youuuu
