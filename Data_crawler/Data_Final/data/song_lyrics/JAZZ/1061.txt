Song Name: Asunder
You could tell my dreams
Asunder Open up my heart
In your head Nothing makes me feel
Feel this humble Than having you alone
In my arms You could fill my dreams
With your tender? Nothing makes me feel
Feel this hunger And wanting just to please
Soooo I become so lonely
When I'm without you
Don't you know that it don't mean
I don't stay alone
And I've got my??
On the ground I become quite frightened when I'm out there In the middle of all this b.shit that don't mean
