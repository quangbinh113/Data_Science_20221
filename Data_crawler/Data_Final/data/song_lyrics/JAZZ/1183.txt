Song Name: Any Story
The night was cold and I was
Told to keep the silence and go
Look at the seaside the trouble
Is waiting and the wind blows outside
Before you break any soul before you try
Hold on to the days that will come by by by
Any story can be mine
Any heart can run with love
But this road that I have found
Is a mountain that flies, that turns to be mine
When the silence speaks words you don't wanna say
When the pain starts to fade away
When the fire takes you to the light
When the word shows you where to find love
Love won't you please take us back to that time
Love won't you please when everything was one
Any story can be mine
Any heart can run with love
But this road that I have found
Is a mountain that flies, that turns to be mine
Any story can be mine
Any heart can run with love
But this road that I have found
Is a mountain that flies, that turns to be mine
We came in so many essay
Broken bones and tie you soul
But none has been defeated
Soldiers of love and rivers own
Soldiers of love and children of hope
Any story can be mine
Any heart can run with love
But this road that I have found
Is a mountain that flies, that turns to be mine
Any story can be mine
Any heart can run with love
But this road that I have found
Is a mountain that flies, that turns to be mine
