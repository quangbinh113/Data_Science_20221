Song Name: Tie Me Down (with Elley Duh√©)
Don't lie
I know you've been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time
And you wanna keep it in
I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I'll feel the same
I'm right here baby so please
Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
Nine lives until you fall at my feet
Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
You're not shy, so baby it's useless
So don't try, cause you'll end up losing it
I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I'll feel the same
I'm right here baby so please
Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
Cause nobody waste this waiting game
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay
Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down, down)
