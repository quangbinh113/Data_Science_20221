Song Name: Paper Boats
Paper Boats
Drifting in the lake
Our names, are sailing away
Sleepyhead
In the morning light
Buried in the books
All night
But your eyes still found mine
I hold your face
Something changed when I saw you
I feel warm and new
You know I'm shy
But something changed when I met you
I feel a little braver like you
Like you
You're like my first memory
You're precious to me now
You're like my first memory
You're precious to me now
Take my hand
Run with me
Touch my hand
Something's changed
Run with me
Though the rain
Something's changed
Play hide and seek
And nothing matters now
Nothing's the same now
You're like my first memory
You're precious to me now
You're like my first memory
You're precious to me now
You're just like the sun
