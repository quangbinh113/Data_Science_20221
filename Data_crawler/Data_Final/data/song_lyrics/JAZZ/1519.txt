Song Name: Dream On Dreamer
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
There you go day and night
Up in the clouds flying so high
You try your best to stretch your mind
Beyond reality and sense and rhyme
You see things make your big heart sing
Like the flowers trees and birds and pretty things
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
You like to step aside
Then you release yourself and fly
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day
Now the paisly pages of your mind
Are so complete like seeing colours black and white
Do you realize that you look so spaced out
You've made your peace with the need to be free
Without a doubt
Yeah I frown 'cause something don't look right
It's the twinkly twinkle star thats in your eyes
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
So go on and step aside
And release yourself and fly
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day
You know you gotta
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If you live to learn you'll be lucky one day
Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over
