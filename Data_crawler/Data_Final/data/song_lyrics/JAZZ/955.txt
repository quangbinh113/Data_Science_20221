Song Name: Blue Sky
Oh yesterday, I fell in love with an angel
And it feels so good
I can even remember
Why I've been searching so long
For a reason to live
For a reason to try
On a rainy Sunday night
Sipping whisky at the Jazz Club bar
Red lips, blue heels, dress so tight
Suddenly I saw the light
Black hat, hands so smooth
Smoke travelling through his lips
He asked, "Do you like blues?"
He put his hands on my hips
I wanna reach a blue sky where there's no heart disease
When I'm with you I can only dream about a thing
I wanna reach my blue sky, yeah, I wanna believe
That you may love me, too 'cause I do, I do
Wanna reach my blue sky away from my fears
A place I can truly be me and I do
I do have found my blue sky, it wasn't overseas
I just have to look at you, baby
My blue sky dream's so obsessive
I don't feel like getting over it
I still hear you whispering my name
When I was naively laying on your bed
I want to believe your lies
We're still awake watching the sunrise
Mister false pretence
Like Amy said, "You don't make sense"
Oh yesterday, I fell in love with an angel
And it feels so good
I can even remember
Why I've been searching so long
For a reason to live
For a reason to try
I wanna reach a blue sky where there's no heart disease
When I'm with you I can only dream about a thing
I wanna reach my blue sky, yeah, I wanna believe
That you may love me, too 'cause I do, I do
Wanna reach my blue sky away form my fears
A place I can truly be me and I do
I do have found my blue sky, it wasn't overseas
I just have to look at you, baby
