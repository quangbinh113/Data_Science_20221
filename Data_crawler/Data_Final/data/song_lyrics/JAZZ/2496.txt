Song Name: Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby - 2002 Remaster
I got a man that's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love him
Yes I love him
And I'm gonna walk up to his gate
And see if we can get this thing straight
'Cause I want him
And you know I intend to have him
I'll just ask
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
But it seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A man is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of what you will find
He's gone and made a change
Well is you is or is you ain't my baby
Well maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby, is he still my baby true
A man is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of what you will find
He's gone and made a change
So is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe my baby's found somebody new
I hope not
'Cause I hope my baby still my baby true
