Song Name: She Calls Me the Moon
She calls me the moon
Brooklyn walking cross my mind
Beatrice, my divine
You're something special to me
She calls me the moon
She's extraordinary, queen
She sees god, even in me
You're something special to me
And when darkness claims the room
I remember when she sang me the blues
And she's shining in a melancholy bloom
She calls me the moon
She wrote me a language
And we speak it on our own
Feeling close when I'm alone
She's my favorite author
She wrote me a language
And it rolls right off the tongue
Could be spoken, could be sung
She's my favorite author
And when darkness claims the room
I remember when she sang me the blues
And she's shining in a melancholy bloom
She calls me the moon
Soak me in your moonglow
Though we're apart
I can still feel your love
