Song Name: Ella
Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?

Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?

The winter feeling is a no go
Encapsulated by a loco
Your arm around me in the friend zone
I cannot breathe I need some ozone
When the leaves are changing
And the light is fading
People blow their top when they think life is rearranging
Neighbours don't have curtains
Data made off lurking
I don't have an A8 but I promise I'll keep working
So
Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?
And Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?
She comе up too fast with the quick talk offensive
I think you won't last 'causе I'm way too defensive
She will be the master
Yeah she will be the master
Yeah she will be the master
I know it's preemptive
I can't breathe when I see her
And everything that is on my mind
Will disappear with my last breath?
With my last breath
Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?

And Ella
Are you next to me?
Can you still my feet?
Can you still my feet?
