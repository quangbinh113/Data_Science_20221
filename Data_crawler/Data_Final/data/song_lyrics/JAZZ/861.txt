Song Name: Electric Swing
All the people all around the world
Should come together where their hearts don't hurt
Here we don't matter what your spirit is
We can dance like Egyptians in the pyramids, uh
Put a Flagpole on a mountaintop
Why don't you, celebrate what you got or not
Why won't you, stop thinking and get out of your head
I got the remedy, feel that?
It makes you dance
It makes you sing
Transcends the ordinary things
Up in the igloos
All the way down to Beijing
Electric swing
Electric swing
Everybody's looking to the light
Let's give a celebrational high five
Kick off your shoes for the earthy grooves
And get indigenous tripping like a didgeridoo, uh
Sing a little like the birds and the bees
Why don't you, grab somebody in a friendlier squeeze
Why won't you, stop thinking and get out of your head
I got the remedy, feel that?
It makes you dance
It makes you sing
Transcends the ordinary things
Up in the igloos
All the way down to Beijing
Electric swing
Electric swing
Attention all the radio squeakers
The movements coming through your speakers
Black your telly-telly bunkum box
Close your Mac tops
Turn the message up
Get inside a gold kimono trip
Now break it down as with the CD skepticals

Electric swing
Electric swing
Electric swing
