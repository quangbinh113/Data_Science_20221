Song Name: Faking Love (feat. Saweetie)
You tell me you're leaving today
You're packing your bags up for good
I'm not gonna stand in your way
Baby, I'd cry if I could, but
I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true
Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
Boy, bye
Thought I was a fool, nice try
Need a invoice for my time
You done kill my vibe
Thinkin' I'm a ride or die
Matter fact, click-clack, bye
They know why, ain't no one surprised I'm in these streets
Let me live my life, throw a party when you leave, leave, leave
Hey, Anitta, we're the divas
With a 401k in Ibiza
Is she bonita? I wanna meet her
Can you balance work and pleasure like a Libra?
I'm at Ipanema with a couple bad bitches (yeah)
Tannin' topless and we takin' mad pictures (uh-huh)
Fragile ego, now you gotta gas niggas
Faking love, I need somethin' that's realer
Feel like I'm running out of ways to say (say)
That I ain't feeling any type of way about you
Keep getting caught up when your hands on me, like
Ooh, I (want it), I (got it), ain't sorry, but I got
All I'm needin', all I need
I'll be leaving, I'll be gone (gone), gone
Do as I please, oh, baby, it's too easy to let you go
So (yeah)
I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true
Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
I been faking love with you
I keep faking love (yeah, yeah)
I keep faking love with you (yeah, yeah)
I been faking love (ha)
I been faking love, it's true (oh)
Now we breaking up (breaking up)
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
