Song Name: Alice
Come again
I didn't catch what you said
Come again
I didn't clock what you meant
I think I'm earning a subtle aversion to you
Someone must be looking after me
Making it so very easy to forget about you
Walk right past look right through and not feel a thing
Well I suppose it's got to happen when someone is too cool
And I know all the tricks are in the book
You aught to leave them there you don't get a second look
Keep your cool now don't you be warming up
Leave me messages short and sweet asking if I'd like to meet
Just like the first time
Well the first time that we met
Got the golden treatment
Couldn't get you out of my head
But I remember oh so clear
There's good reason that you're not there
Oh 'cause I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling so fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably
Feeling so fine
Oh boy you better be joking or do you think I'm mad
That I would ever contemplate, ever coming back
To hear it all again and watch your wandering whims
Your eyes never convinced me that you could be my man
So remember, don't be getting close over here
I'll help you with your coat
I see the glimmer, I see the hope, I see your pride
Let me introduce you to mine
Oh 'cause I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Oh feeling
I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably
Feeling so fine
'Cause I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling remarkably fine
I'm over it
Yeah feeling, feeling so fine
I'm over it
Feeling, feeling so fine
Feeling so, Oh feeling so fine
