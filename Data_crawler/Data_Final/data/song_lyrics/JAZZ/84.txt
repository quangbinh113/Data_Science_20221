Song Name: Like the Movies
Maybe one day I'll fall in a bookstore
Into the arms of a guy
We'll sneak into bars
And gaze at the stars
Surrounded by fireflies
Oh, I'd like to sleep in 'til two on a Sunday
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
Get soaked in the rain
And smile through the pain
Slow dance under stormy skies
Maybe I'm just old-fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck
No one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love
Oh, maybe I'm just old-fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck
No one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love
