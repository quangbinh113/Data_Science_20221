Song Name: Do It For Me
Show me how
Show me how you like it done
You're all mine
I'll make you feel like you're the one
Take off your clothes
Give me your trust
Look me in the eyes and confess your lust
Get on your knees
Beg me to stop
I promise I'll love you if you do it
So do it for me
Give me your hand
I'll show you things you've never done
Hold my head
I'll make you feel like never before
Take off your clothes
Give me your trust
Look me in the eyes and confess your lust
Get on your knees
Beg me to stop
I promise I'll love you if you do it
So do it for me
Say my name
All I wanna do is hear you scream in pain
Say my name
I promise I'll love you if you do it
So do it for me
So do it for me
