Song Name: Other Half
Stayed up
Wide awake like usual, just thinking
What it's like to have someone that stays by
Oh by your side no matter what you do
Tried to
I tried to find somebody new that I could
Share all of my stupid thoughts but no one
No one seems that interested enough
Until I met this girl one day
And we both spent our time 'til late
She made my heart beat with her smile
Oh I
Oh I
I wanna make you mine
Promise that we would last
No, I'm not here to tell you lies
I'm just here 'cause I'm in love
With you, that's right
No, I can't get enough
I've been searching for a while
Now I've found my other half
We, we started off beautifully
Yeah, we, we understood both our needs
Oh we, yeah
Compliment each other's missing piece
Oh, I'm so glad I met you, babe
We'd talk on the phone 'til 4 a.m.
Hearing your voice just makes me smile
Oh I
Oh I
I wanna make you mine
Promise that we would last
No, I'm not here to tell you lies
I'm just here 'cause I'm in love
With you, that's right
No, I can't get enough
I've been searching for a while
Now I've found my other half
I wanna make you proud
Show you I'm worth your time
And I'll take care of your heart
You don't have to worry 'bout
Anything, 'cause we've got everything
I've been searching for a while
Now I've found my other half, yeah
You make me feel like I'm alive
My medicine for when I'm down
You make me feel like I'm alive
My medicine for when I'm down
