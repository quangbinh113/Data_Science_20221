Song Name: Jasmine
Blinds all soaked in light
Wake up to you
Tracing eights on my hand
Jasmine on rusted wire
Once fully bloomed
Now separates
Shine on me a light
A daily prayer
Let me ease your mind
Oh, Jasmine
Tell me what happened
Oh, Jasmine
Tell me what happened
Oh, Jasmine
Oh, Jasmine
Blinds soaked up the light
Late afternoon
Tracing eights on my wall
What could I give to bring back the summer
My hands on rusted wire
Blue waters, cool showers
Slow hours, your figure
Shine on me a light
A daily prayer
Let me ease your mind
Oh, Jasmine
Tell me what happened (oh yeah, oh yeah, tell, tell, tell, tell)
Oh, Jasmine (could you tell me)
Tell me what happened (tell me what happened)
Oh, Jasmine
(Oh)
If I'd never know ya
If I'd never know ya
If I'd never told ya
If I'd never told ya
