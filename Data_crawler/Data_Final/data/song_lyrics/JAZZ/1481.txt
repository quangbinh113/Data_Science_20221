Song Name: Don't Ask My Neighbors
You're wondering if I care about ya
Is there's some cause that I should doubt ya
Oh I can see boy that you don't know me very well
You're so unsure
And you run here and there to ask my feelings
Friends only guess, they can't really say
Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
Don't be afraid to come to me
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid of what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid
You ask all my friends if I'm the same girl
You don't understand, you think I'm changing
Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
Don't be afraid to come to me
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid of what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid of what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid
