Song Name: It's Not for Me to Say - From the MGM Film "Lizzie"
It's not for me to say, you love me
It's not for me to say, you'll always care
Oh, but here for the moment, I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine, and dream that love will last
As far as I can see, this is heaven
And speaking just for me, it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing day
Or we may never meet again, but then it's not for me to say
And speaking just for me, it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing day
Or we may never meet again, but then it's not for me to say
