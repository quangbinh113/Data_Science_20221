Song Name: I Don't Wanna Be Okay Without You
I'm saying things I don't believe
And your love casts its shadow on the things I do
And I can hear so clearly all the words I wish I said
You're stuck in my head
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you
Now I can't find the words to say
That'll be the perfect balance between loud and clear
And I can hear so well, your lovely voice inside my head
Saying you love me, oh

But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind, alright
But I don't wanna be okay without you
But I only think of you

Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
Oh, you're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you
Without you...
No, I don't wanna be okay without you
