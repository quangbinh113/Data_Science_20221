Song Name: Don't Bother None
Readin' my paper in Ray's cafe
The ol' guy next to me is loud as day
Rambled and rambled while eatin' his pie
He dropped his wallet, now its mine
Sorry old man but that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
Picked up the wallet and slipped out side
Walked around and walked around and walked around town
I found my nerve and a good place to hide
Only to find no cash inside
Oh well, I guess that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
I got thirsty so I went to a bar
Met a lil darlin' with the face of a star
In the mornin' woke up to find
She stole my car along with my heart
Oh well, I guess that's jus' the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
Wish she'd give me back my heart
Oh well, I guess that's jus' the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
