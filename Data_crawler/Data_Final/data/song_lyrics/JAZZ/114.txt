Song Name: Fine
Woke up with a headache
And some neck pain
Cup of coffee need the caffeine
Oh I don't know the last time
I wasn't tired

Check out in the fast lane
The lady asked if I've been
Having me a nice day
I said that I'm fine
Guess that I'm a liar
Cuz
Yeah I'm fine
If "F" is for feeling overwhelmed
And "I" is for "I'm not alright"
Yeah I'm fine
If "N" is for not being able to sleep
E for every night
Yeah I'm fine
Finally feeling the pressure of
Keeping my feelings inside
Yeah I'm fine
Well maybe I'm not
And I just need to tell someone
I'm not alright
Do you wonder how it'd feel to
Let somebody in to finally see the real you
Me too
I hide behind a mask
But it's getting pretty see through
Cuz I'm so tired of trying to pretend like
I can do it on my own
When in the end I'm
Sick and tired of feeling alone
I wish there was a way that
You could read my mind
When I say I'm fine because
Yeah I'm fine
If "F" is for feeling overwhelmed
And "I" is for "I'm not alright"
Yeah I'm fine
If "N" is for not being able to sleep
E for every night
Yeah I'm fine
Finally feeling the pressure of
Keeping my feelings inside
Yeah I'm fine
Well maybe I'm not
And I just need to tell someone
I'm not alright
Maybe I should tell someone I'm not
Oh tell someone I'm not alright
Cuz lately I'm saying I'm fine
And I know I'm lying cuz
Yeah I'm fine
If "F" is for feeling overwhelmed
And "I" is for "I'm not alright
Yeah I'm fine
If "N" is for not being able to sleep
E for every night
Yeah I'm fine
Finally feeling the pressure of
Keeping my feelings inside
Yeah I'm fine
Well maybe I'm not
And I just need to tell someone
I'm not alright
