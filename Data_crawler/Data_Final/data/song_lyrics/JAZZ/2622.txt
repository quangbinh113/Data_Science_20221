Song Name: I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)
I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered
In your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well
I've forgotten you
Just like I said I would
Of course, I have
Or maybe except when I hear your name
Someone's laugh that's just the same
I've forgotten you just like I should
What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my aching heart
Could keep the moon
What's in store
Should I phone once more?
No, no, no, no, no
It's best that I stick to my tune
I said that I get along
Without you very well
Of course, I do
Except perhaps in spring
But then I should never, ever think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two
