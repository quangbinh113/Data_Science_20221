Song Name: Donâ€™t Matter
Nothing will last, they say
The more we try things would fade
Don't try to find a friend
We're alone anyway
Don't be too kind
It's a far too scary place sometimes
For you to be that way
Nothing will last
And that's what they say
Well, I guess it might be true
But I'm not gonna give up on you
I will fight for the light
That sometimes don't shine
Nothing will last
But it don't matter
'Cause I held on 'til I could
Maybe you'll lose the one so dear
Who kept you warm and safe
I guess even love has it's own ways
It comes and decays
How small are we
When everything changes so helplessly?
Nothing will last
And that's what they say
Well, I guess it might be true
But I'm not gonna give up on you
I will fight for the light
That sometimes don't shine
Nothing will last
But it don't matter
'Cause I held on 'til I could
