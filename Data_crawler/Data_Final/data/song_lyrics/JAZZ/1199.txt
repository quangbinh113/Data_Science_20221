Song Name: Waiting My Life
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey no
The bus is riding, at the break of dawn
We gotta go rock it
Jokes and jiving to get rid of the blues
We gotta survive it
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
Waiting my life to come good
Through the jungle we hear sound of souls
We gotta get ...
We're crossing truck loads if karanga wood
We gotta get lined up
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
Waiting my life to come good
Hey waiting my life to come
I hear a sound
That gives a sign to start
They got the banks
We got the loans
They got the rights
We got the needs
They got the banks
We got the loans
They got the rights
We got the needs
Who care to fight
Get paid to burn
Be so brown
And a few old trees
...unfinished...
