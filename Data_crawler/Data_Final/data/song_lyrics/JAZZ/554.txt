Song Name: Love Will Keep Us Alive
I was standing all alone against the world outside
You were searching for a place to hide
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
Don't you worry, sometimes you've just gotta let it ride
The world is changing right before your eyes
Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
I would die for you, climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing nothing I wouldn't do
Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
I would die for you, climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
I was standing all alone against the world outside
You were searching for a place to hide
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive um um love will keep us alive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
