Song Name: friendship?
Last week when ya'
Broke up with him
Said you need to talk it over
So you came over
To my shoulder
We won't say, but we both know it
Dancing around the elephant in the room
Tell me if we're just friends
How come it never feels like it?
Acting like it don't make sense
'Cause we're scared to lose the friendship
Don't say it hasn't crossed your mind
What would happen if we crossed that line?
Something's waiting on the other side
Who cares about the friendship
If I've got you
Every time I
Hear that song, I
See your hand whip out the window
And I rewind it
In my mind the, memories they play in slo-mo
So close, but a million miles from me
Tell me if we're just friends
How come it never feels like it?
Acting like it don't make sense
'Cause we're scared to lose the friendship
Don't say it hasn't crossed your mind
What would happen if we crossed that line?
Something's waiting on the other side
Who cares about the friendship?
Tell me something real
Tell me something real
'Cause I don't know how I feel
Don't know how I feel
Tell me something true
Tell me something true
All I want is you
All I want is you
To tell me if we're just friends
How come it never feels like it?
Acting like it don't make sense
'Cause we're scared to lose the
Friendship
(Oh we're scared to lose the friendship)
Don't say it hasn't crossed your mind
(Don't say it hasn't crossed your mind)
What would happen if we crossed that line?
(What would happen?)
Something's waiting on the other side
(Oh)
Who cares about the friendship?
If I've got you
If I've got you
I only want you
