Song Name: Under a Spell
I'm so lost
I've been hypnotized, yeah
I can't find myself
It feels like I'm
Under some kind of spell
This is some kind of spell
It's just like it's magic
Oh, but I can't quite tell, oh
But it's somethin' fantastic
Into this love, I fell
I'm under some kind of spell
This is some kind of spell
Oh, yeah, I could lose myself in you
There's nothin' I can do
Under that spell
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is some kind of spell
This is some kind of spell (spell, spell, spell)
Some kind of spell, yeah
Under some kind of spell
Some kind of spell, yeah
I'm under some kind of spell
