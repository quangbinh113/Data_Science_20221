Song Name: Gone Again
He's gone again
Maybe not for long, but he's gone again
And it's wrong
Wrong to leave so unaware
Wrong to leave me in despair
But, oh, he's gone again
Alone again
Maybe not for long, but alone again
And it's wrong
Wrong because I love him deeply
Wrong because I'm his completely
Oh, he's gone again
Does he know I miss him?
Every night, so long, he's been gone so long
How I long to touch him
When will he return? Or will he ever learn?
He's home again
Maybe not for long, but he's home again
And it's wrong
Wrong because I can't believe
He's come home to love only me
Oh, yes, I know he'll just be gone again
Well does, does he know I miss him?
Every night, so long, he's been gone so long
How I long to touch him
And when will he return? Or will he ever learn?
He's home again
Maybe not for long, but he's home again
And it's wrong
Wrong because I can't believe
He's come home to love only me
Oh, yes, I know he'll just be gone
Just be gone
Again
