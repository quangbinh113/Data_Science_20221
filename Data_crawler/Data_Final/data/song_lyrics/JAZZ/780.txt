Song Name: The Beat Goes On/Soul Bossa Nova
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La da da da dee, la da da da da
Charleston was once the rage, uh huh
History has turned that page, uh huh
The mini skirt's the current thing, uh huh
Teenybopper is a newborn king, uh huh
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La da da da dee, la da da da da
The grocery store's a super mart, uh huh
Little girls still break their hearts, uh huh
Oh, well, the men still keep on marching off to war
Electrically they keep their baseball scores
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on
The beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on
Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce
Boys still chasing girls to get a kiss
Well, the cars keep going faster
And faster all the time
A bum still cries
"Hey buddy, have you got a dime?"
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La da da da dee, la da da da da
Oh and the beat goes on
The beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La da da da da da dee
La da da da da
Oh the beat goes on
The beat goes on
It goes on, it goes on and on
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on
The beat goes on
On and on and on and the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La da da da dee, la da da da da
