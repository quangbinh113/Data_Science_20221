Song Name: It Don't Mean a Thing
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah
It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing
Doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah
Makes no difference if that rhythm's sweet or hot,
Give that rhythm everything, everything you've got
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Dooo-ah dooooo-ah
Don't mean a thing all you gotta do is sing
Dooooo-ah Doo-ah
Makes no difference if that rhythm's sweet or hot,
Give that rhythm everything, everything you've got
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah doo-ah
