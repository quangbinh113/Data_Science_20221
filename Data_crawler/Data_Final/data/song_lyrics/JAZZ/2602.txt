Song Name: Li'l Liza Jane - Live at the Newport Jazz Festival, Newport, RI, June 30, 1960
Where's my tambourine? Wait a minute
I'll get your tambourine
Got my tambourine, get your thing baby
What's wrong with you? What is it?
Can't forget my tambourine, boy, wait a minute
This is a folk tune and it's called "Little Liza Jane"
We get some rhythm started here and see what happens
I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane
I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane
I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane
I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Come my love and live with me (Liza Jane)
I will take good care of thee Little Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Come my love and live with me (Liza Jane)
I will take good care of thee Little Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Hambone Hammer where you've been (Liza Jane)
Down by the creek making gin (Liza Jane)
I know a man that's three feet tall (Liza Jane)
Drinks his liquor and has a ball (Liza Jane)
Saw him just the other day (Liza Jane)
He had a horse and a bail of hay (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Little Liza Jane
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Little Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
He took me to this great big town (Liza Jane)
Lot of people standing around (Liza Jane)
They were listening to a great big band (Liza Jane)
The bestest music in the land (Liza Jane)
I tell you once and tell you twice (Liza Jane)
Enjoy yourself and live your life (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Little Liza Jane
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Jane Little Liza
Little Liza Jane Little Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane oh Little Liza Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza Liza Jane
Oh Little Liza
Little my Liza Jane (Jane)
