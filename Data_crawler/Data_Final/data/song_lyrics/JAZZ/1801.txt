Song Name: There Will Never Be Another You - 2004 Remaster
There will be
Many other nights
Like this
And i'll be
Standing here
With someone new
There will be
Other songs to sing
Another fall
Another spring
But there
Will never be
Another you
There will be
Other lips
That i may kiss
But they
Won't thrill me
Like yours used to do
Yes
I may dream
A million dreams
But how
Can they come true
If there
Will never ever
Be another you?
There will be
Many other
Nigths like this
And i'll be
Standing here
With someone new
There will be
Other songs to sing
Another fall
Another spring
But there
Will never be
Another you
There will be
Other lips
That i may kiss
But they
Won't thrill me
Like yours used to do
Yes
I may dream
A million dreams
But how
Can they come true
If there will never
Ever be another you?
