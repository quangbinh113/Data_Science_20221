Song Name: The Road Is Lonesome
Don't wanna know what's written on the last page

Let's just leave cause I've grown so tired of this place
Oh the road is lonesome before you travel on it
Oh the road is lonesome before you travel on it

Let the wind run through my fingers
There's a cool breeze coming from the sea
I hear the sand under the wheels
There's a cool breeze
Our eldorado won't stop running, I'm drifting to sleep

While you drive me far away we left head over heels
Oh the road is lonesome before you travel on it
Let the wind run through my fingers
There's a cool breeze coming from the sea
I hear the sand under the wheels
There's a cool breeze
Oh the road is lonesome
Oh the road is lonesome before you travel on it
We travel light, not more than what fitted in a paperbag
Grabbed our boards for a roadtrip in a Cadillac
Oh the road is lonesome before you travel on it
Let the wind run through my fingers
There's a cool breeze coming from the sea
I hear the sand under the wheels
There's a cool breeze coming from the sea
