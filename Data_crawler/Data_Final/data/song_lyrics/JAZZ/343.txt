Song Name: Take me to Church
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me
"Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
Take me to church
I'll- at the shrine of your lies
I'll- and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God
Let me give you my life
Take me to church
(Your good God)
At the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
And you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
Good, good
Good times
Good, good times
Take me to church (church, church)
Take me to church
(I'll worship like a dog)
(At the shrine of your lies)
I'll tell you my sins
(And you can sharpen your knife)
Aaa, amen, amen
Amen
Aaa, amen, amen
Amen
Take me to church
I'll-
(Royalty)
Take me to-
Church
Take me
(God)
God
God
Take me to church
Take me to church
God
Take, take, take me to church
Church
Church
Church
Church
Church, church
Take, take, take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
At the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
(Sharpen your knife)
