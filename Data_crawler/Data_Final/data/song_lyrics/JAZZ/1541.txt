Song Name: Never Let Me Go
Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch
What would I be without you
There's no place for me without you
Never let me go
I'd be lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know
Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart
You'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?
Never let me go
Never let me go
Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart
You'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?
Never let me go
Never let me go
