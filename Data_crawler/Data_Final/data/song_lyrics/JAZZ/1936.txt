Song Name: Rags to Riches (with Elton John)
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything
So open your arms and you open the door
To every treasure that I am hoping for
Hold me and kiss me
And tell me you're mine ever more
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams would not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams would not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you
