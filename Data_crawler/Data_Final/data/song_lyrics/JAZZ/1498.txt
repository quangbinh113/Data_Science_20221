Song Name: Never Stop
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Feels so good to be together
Spending some time, making love
Making plans to last forever
Staying true until the end
True
There ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want?
What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Evergreen, growin' up but fadin' never
This is what our love became, free at last
Free from all the pain and sorrow
Never feel the hurt again
True
There ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want?
What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up
True
There ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
And I'm hoping that you feel it too
What you want?
What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up
Take your time won't you try love
Not a thing you can buy love
Take your time won't you try love
Not a thing you can buy love
Never stop never giving up
True
There ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
And I'm hoping that you feel it too
What you want?
What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up
Oh, true, baby, baby
Never, never stop
You never, never, never, never, never, come
Never stop, never stop
