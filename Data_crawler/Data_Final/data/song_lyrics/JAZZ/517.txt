Song Name: Let There Be Love
Let there be you,
Let there be me.
Let there be oysters
Under the sea.
Let there be wind,
An occassional rain.
Chile con carne,
Sparkling champagne --
Let there be birds
To sing in the trees,
Someone to bless me
Whenever I sneeze.
Let there be cuckoos,
A lark and a dove,
But first of all, please --
Let there be love.
~interlude~
Let there be cuckoos,
A lark and a dove,
But first of all, please --
Let there be love...
Hmmm umm... love
Hmmm umm... love
Let there be love.
