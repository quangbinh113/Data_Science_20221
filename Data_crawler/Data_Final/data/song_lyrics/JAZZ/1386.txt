Song Name: The Masquerade Is Over
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And then I'll learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes
You look, you look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says, "No, no you're not the same"
I'm afraid the masquerade is over, all over
And so is love, and so is love
It's all over, and so is love
