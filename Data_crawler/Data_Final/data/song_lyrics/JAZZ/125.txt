Song Name: bandaids
You should have told me
I don't know what to say
Why are you sorry?
How did it get this way?
My heart is broken
Down to my core
It's not what I wanted
I don't know what I want anymore
I'm afraid that bandaids
Are no good for heartache
Not okay, so tell me
When your world is falling down
Afraid of falling down
But fire has started right behind me
And if I don't jump now
I fear that I can't take the burning
I can't hear a sound
Nothin' that I say can hurt me
Dive into the ground
I fear that I can't take the burning
I'm afraid that bandaids
Are no good for heartache
Not okay, so tell me
When your world is falling down
Friends of flowers
Fragile silence
Stand beside you
Stop your crying
I'm afraid that bandaids (Friends of flowers)
Are no good for heartache (Fragile silence)
Not okay, so tell me (Stand beside you)
When your world is falling down (Stop your crying)
