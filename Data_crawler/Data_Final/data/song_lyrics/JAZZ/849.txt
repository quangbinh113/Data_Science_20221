Song Name: Glory Box
I'm tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you
From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers may bloom
Maybe be time to move over, and give us some room
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be, a woman
Give me a reason to love you
Mmm... Give me a reason to be, a woman
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be, a woman
Don't you stop of looking like a man
Take a little look from our side when you can
Sow a little tenderness
I won't cry
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be, a woman
Give me a reason to love you
For this is the beginning of forever and ever ever ever ever
It's time to move over
I'm so tired, of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
I've been a temptress too long too long
Just
Too long
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be, a woman
Give me a reason to love you love you
A reason everyday
A reason and you will gain
