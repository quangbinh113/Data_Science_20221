Song Name: Dancing In The Moonlight (feat. NEIMY) - TiÃ«sto Remix
We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody
Dancin' in the moonlight
