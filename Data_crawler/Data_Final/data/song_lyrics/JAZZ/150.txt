Song Name: Nomad
Lost and found, what's new?
You tell a lie that sound true
Go to hell for the view
Everyone in love and it looks so cold
Let it be or let it break, never let go
Until I let go, then I run on my own
Nowhere with no one to tell me no
Dancing with the devil to songs we both know
'Til I find another to dance with a lost soul (soul)
Head in the clouds, holding me down
I'm floating around then hit the ground
Lost my mind, can't find it
Oh my, oh yeah
Swim to other fish 'til I drown
Nomad
Nowhere to go, go mad
Nomad
No one to go with
Nomad
すべて嘘だ
平和のふりする
地獄の球 だ
嘲笑浴び辿り着く
この海渡り息つく
奪え 取り戻すの
猫みたいな運命の方
あても無いままに放浪
逃げる蜃気楼 追った
Head in the clouds, holding me down
Floating around, thеn I hit the ground
Lost my mind, can't find it
Oh my, oh yeah
Swim to other fish 'til I drown
Nomad
Nowhere to go, go mad
Nomad
No one to go with
Nomad
Nomad
Nomad
Nomad
No one to go with
Nomad
