Song Name: Just Friends
Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't ending
Two friends drifting apart
Just two friends
But one broken heart
We loved we laughed we cried
Suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're just friends
Two friends, drifting part
Two friends, but one broken heart
We may have loved and laughed and cried
But suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're just friends
