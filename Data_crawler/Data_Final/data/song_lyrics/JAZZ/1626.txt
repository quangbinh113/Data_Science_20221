Song Name: Give Me the Night
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights
'Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance
'Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
And don't you know we can fly?
Just give me the night
Give me the night
'Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?
And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light
'Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night (all right, tonight)
So give me the night
