Song Name: attention
Ayy
Lately, I've been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom
Show me a little attention (a little attention)
A little attention (a little attention)
Show me attention
Show me a little attention, yeah, yeah
Show me a little attention
Little love and some affection on the side
Little trust and some passion would be nice
It's all I desire
I need it, I cannot deny (cannot deny)
Oh, ayy, I done see something
For my eyes only
Ain't no emoji, cry him only, ah
Ain't no emoji, on my hands only
Show me a little attention
A little atten', yeah
Show me atten', yeah
Show me a little attention now
Show me a little attention
Lately, I've been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom
Show me a little attention (a little attention)
A little atten', yeah (a little attention)
Show me attention
Show me a little attention, yeah, yeah
Show me a little attention
