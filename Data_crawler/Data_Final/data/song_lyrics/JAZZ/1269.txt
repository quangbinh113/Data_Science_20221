Song Name: I Know
I'd like to tell you just a word
I am so sorry to disturb
You may be thinking I'm a fool
I heard you telling you don't care
I heard you thinking loud and clear
It doesn't make me proud of you
I know your time is precious
But give me just a second
I need to strength things out with you
You blew my hopes and dreams away
And there is not a single day
I don't fear the worst because of you
And I know
That is not a dream
But I saw
Yeah I saw your scheme
And I know
You
I saw
I wonder if there's a justice
When I look right into your eyes
Those feelings never lie
My only weapon is the song
And you won't have to sing alone
This is the story of my life
And I know
That is not a dream
But I saw
Yeah I saw your skin
And I know
You
I saw
I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know then I know
I know I know I know I know
I know I know
I saw
I saw I saw I saw
I saw I saw
And I know
I know I know I know
I know I know I know know
'Cause I know
That is not a dream
But I saw
Yeah I saw your skin
And I know
You
I saw
Yeah I know
