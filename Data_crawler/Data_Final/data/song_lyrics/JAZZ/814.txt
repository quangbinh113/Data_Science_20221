Song Name: Black Valentine
Who needs a captain on a love ship?
Someone with no clue of the destination due bow
Ain't that a trip?
Who needs a diamond on a hand of stone?
Someone with the hurt who couldn't make it work,
A trophy because you slipped
Love can't conquer anything
If it's lost without a trace
You might be tough, you might even be strong
But not when you're in this place
Secret lovers – get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers – it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
Who needs a journey on a runaway train?
Your ticket isn't worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork
Who needs redemption from a guiltless crime?
Someone caries dreams from scene to scene
Til they tear apart your mind
Love can't conquer anything
If it's hurting in the deep
You'll be awake, you'll twist your fate
That's not someone you should keep
Secret lovers – get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers – it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
This is their demand for another night they spend in self-conversation
It's a will they came to pose in a letter left they've composed
To repeat the situation
They lie in a loop
Secret lovers – get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers – it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
