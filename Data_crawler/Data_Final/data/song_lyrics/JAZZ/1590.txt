Song Name: Alice In Wonderland
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland?
Over the hill or under land?
Or just behind the tree?
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see
And where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I really wonder where?
And where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I really wonder where?
(Go Roberta!)
Say where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the crazy afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I wonder where?
Tell me where
Where is that faraway land
That the eye can't see
Show me the way to Wonderland
