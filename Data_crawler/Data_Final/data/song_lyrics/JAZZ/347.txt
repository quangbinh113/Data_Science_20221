Song Name: Six Days
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday
You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday?
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late
