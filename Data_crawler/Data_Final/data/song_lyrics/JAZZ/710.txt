Song Name: Be Honest (feat. Burna Boy)
I know you want me
Every day, not only when you're lonely, yeah
You see, you think you know me
But you don't even know nothing about me, yeah
You see my, thick thighs
Lost when you look into my brown eyes
See, my little waist can make you switch sides
You never know the devil in a disguise
So why don't you stand up, baby, and
Tell me, tell me, tell me, do you want me on top?
So let me show you, show you, show you, I don't need to back it up
Don't wanna hold you, mould you, scold you, split you in half with my heart
I just wanna love on you, trust in you, honour you, please, do the same on your part
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Take time
You know say I run whenever I see bad man
Before you come my way, make sure you think twice
Look into my eyes, but I can never see eye
I can point a gun, but you know I could never lie
Come through
I can show you somethin' you can run to
When I finish, you'll be feelin' brand new
Will never be somebody you can run through
And I can put that on my life
One time, no cap, big vibes, slow back
Catch feels, get high
If you make your bed, then you can lie
Just please don't waste my time
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
(Everybody,di body, body, di body, body, oluwa Burna ti de)
People dey talk, dem a gistin'
'Bout the way your body twistin'
Make me lose control in a dis t'ing, boy
And it's all because I'm t'inkin' of us
No go throw me under the bus
Under a spell, I'm under your love
I don't know why nobody want me
Me say my baby, "No dey do me bad"
Put your hand inside my goodie bag
If I do you bad
I beg you, make you no do me back
Gimme one time
One try, be mine, this time
Take time, same time, make we no dey waste time
Girl, I never lie, you already know I'll
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
Be honest (be honest)
You want this (you want this)
But I can be heartless, regardless of my conscience
