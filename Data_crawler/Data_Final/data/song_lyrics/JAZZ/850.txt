Song Name: Fade Out Lines - The Avener Rework
Deeper down
It's everywhere I look from Las Vegas, to right here
Under your dresser, right by your ear
It's creeping in sweetly, it's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly, than slow growing fear
Life was full and fruitful, and you could take a real bite
The juice poring well over, your skins delight
But the shadow it grows, and takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces, to this priceless ballet
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the fade out line
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the deeper down
Did we build all those bridges, to watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily, out of constant trust
The clock is ticking it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the fade out line
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the fade out line
Heading deeper down, we're sliding without noticing, our own decline
Heading deeper down, we're hanging onto
Sweet nothings left behind
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Down deeper down, yeah
Did we build all those bridges, to watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily, out of constant trust
The clock is ticking it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
Did we build all those bridges, to watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily, out of constant trust
The clock is ticking it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the fade out line
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go, into the fade out line
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing, we slide down, deeper down
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight, into the fade out line
Deeper down
