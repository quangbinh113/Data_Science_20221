Song Name: Interstate Love Song - Acoustic; 2019 Remaster
Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I read between the lines
Your lies
Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry
Reply
Leavin' on a southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you've said to me
Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied
Goodbye
Leavin' on a southern train
Only yesterday
You lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I've said to you
