Song Name: Have You Met Miss Jones?
"Have you met miss Jones?"
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just miss Jones to me
And then I said, "Miss Jones"
"You're a girl who understands"
"I'm a man who must be free"
And all at once, I lost my breath
And all at once, was scared to death
And all at once, I owned the Earth and sky
And now I've met miss Jones
And we'll keep on meetin' 'til we die
Miss Jones and I
And all at once, I lost my breath
And all at once, was scared to death
And all at once, I owned the Earth and sky
Now I've met miss Jones
And we'll keep on meetin' 'til we die
Miss Jones and I
Miss Jones and I
Miss Jones and I
Ha
