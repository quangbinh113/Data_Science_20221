Song Name: Crumble
Water and clay
Is that what I'm made of?
Here tomorrow here today
What am I afraid of?
In another life, would I find you?
Baby I'm not usually the type to
Go head first, and ride with you
But you know I'm gonna ride
Yes I crumble
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
When I'm in front of you
Yes I crumble,
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
It's what you make me do
You turn my ego to stone
You're helping me grow,
Yea darling you know, yea
I got no reason to doubt
I'm better cuz you're around
Yea you know
In another life, would I find you?
Baby I'm not usually the type to
Go head first, and ride with you
But you know I'm gonna ride
Yes I crumble
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
When I'm in front of you
Yes I crumble
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
It's what you make me do
Pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird fly
Won't you sing me a little lullaby
Pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird fly
Yes I love the way you fly
Pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird fly
Won't you sing me a little lullaby
Pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird fly
Yes I love the way you fly
Yes I crumble
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
When I'm in front of you
Yes I crumble
When I'm in front of you
I swear I crumble
It's what you make me do
