Song Name: Home
There's no life, without love they say
None worth having anyway
You're a mystery to me some days
That's what keeps me sane
A heart that yearns is always young
But you can't love just anyone
It's been a while since 21
But I still feel the same
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a silence I need
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Wherever you are is where I call home
'Cause we're just you and me
We drink and laugh and dance 'til three
I have everything I need when I'm with you alone
Home is where we stay all night
No roof above our starry sky
I'd lie here 'til the day I die
And our time together's flown
So, take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a silence I need
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Wherever you are is where I call home
And I know I've made mistakes at times
Every now and then I've made you cry
For that I'm sorry
They were few and far between
We're closer now than we've ever been
You know I'm sorry
I used to wonder why I'm here
No rhyme no reason would appear
Since we've met, it's loud and clear
I'm here to see you home
