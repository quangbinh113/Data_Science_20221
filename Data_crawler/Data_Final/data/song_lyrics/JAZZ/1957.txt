Song Name: Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis
Hey Charlie, I'm pregnant and living on a ninth street
Right above a dirty bookstore off Euclid avenue
I stopped taking dope, I quit drinking whiskey
My old man plays the trombone and works out at the track
He says that he loves me even though its not his baby
He says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son
He gave me a ring that was worn by his mother
And he takes me out to dancin' every saturday nite
Hey Charlie, I think about you everytime I pass a fillin' station
On account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair
I still have that record of "Little Anthony & The Imperials"
But someone stole my record player, how do you like that?
Hey Charlie, I almost went crazy after Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha to live with my folks
Everyone I used to know was either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis, this time I think I'm gonna stay
Hey Charlie, I think I'm happy for the first time since my accident
I wish I have all the money we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot, I wouldn't sell any of 'em
I'd just drive a different car every day, dependin on how I feel
Hey Charlie, for Christ sakes, do you want to know the truth of it?
I don't have a husband, he don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money to pay this lawyer, and Charlie, hey
I'll be eligible for parole, come Valentines day
