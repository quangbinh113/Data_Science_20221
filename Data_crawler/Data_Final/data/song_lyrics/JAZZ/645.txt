Song Name: You & Me - OT: Hong Kong Morning
Taking a trip down memory lane
Things have changed One thing remains
That they will always have each other
And even though those days have gone
They know here is where they belong
There's some kinda magic in the air
Feel the warmth
That only summer breezes can bring
Sweet little notes of spring begin
Nothing to fear
Taking one step at a time
Walking hand in hand
1 2 3 4
Cheek to cheek
And they're learning How to do that dance
Let this love be forever more they say
I wish for this, to be true for you and me
Holding her close he leading the way
Out at the park Enjoying the Day
And you can tell they'll be okay
Feel the warmth
That only summer breezes can bring
Sweet little notes of spring begin
Nothing to fear
Taking one step at a time
Walking hand in hand
1 2 3 4
Cheek to cheek
And they're learning How to do that dance
Let this love be forever more they say
I wish for this, to be true for you and me
Taking one step at a time
Walking hand in hand
1 2 3 4
Cheek to cheek
And they're learning How to do that dance
Let this love be forever more they say
I wish for this, to be true for you and me
To be true for you and me
To be true for you and me
You and me
You and me
