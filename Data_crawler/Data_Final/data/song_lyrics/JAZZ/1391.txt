Song Name: Lullaby Of Birdland
Lullaby of birdland that's what I
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be ways to repeal
In a phrase, how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtledoves
Bill and coo when they love
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a wheapy ol' willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love
And there's a wheapy ol' willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love
