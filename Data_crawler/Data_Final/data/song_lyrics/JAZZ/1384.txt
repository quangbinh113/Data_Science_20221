Song Name: Embraceable You
Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
You, irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms around you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you
