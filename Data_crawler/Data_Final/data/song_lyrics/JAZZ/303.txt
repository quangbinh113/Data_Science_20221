Song Name: Coming In Hot
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot (brr, brr, brr)
I'm coming in hot (hot, hot, hot, ayy)
Coming in hot, hot, hot (SAK PASE)
Shoot that (shoot that shot)
Ayy, why not?
Yeah, coming in hot (coming in hot)
Just like the fajita (like the fajita)
I write what I live (write what I live)
My life in the speaker (life in the speaker)
I'm nice with the flow (nice with the)
Just like the demeanor (like the demeanor)
I'm feeding my fam (feed up my fam)
I'm feeding the meter, uh
They got the iron while I got the steamer
I bring the fire, but you never seen her
I testify, don't need a subpoena
They want my soul, better go to Korea
I love my dog, just like I'm PETA
Gotta protect Him, I made the call in just like I'm repping
I know we left yeah, now we back together
But I guess that it's Better Later than Never, like ugh
What's happenin'?
I'ma need y'all to quit askin' when
Me and my wife gon' have some kids
Right now we just practicin' (woo, woo)
Practicin'
Teacher said quit rappin', man
That gon' hurt my average
I said "Thank God I ain't average"
Yeah, I'm a bright young man
Kill the GPA (GPA)
And the BPM (BPM)
Look we on (ten)
So say what you say
'Cause that's A with Lecrae
From the A-Train to the A
I'm coming in hot
I don't do the most but I do a lot (mmm)
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot (brr, brr, brr)
I'm coming in hot (ayy, uh)
Coming in (hey)
I'ma shoot that (shot)
Ayy, why not? (Ayy, why not? Ayy, yup)
I'm coming in
Wake 'em up (wake 'em up)
Wake 'em up (wake 'em up)
See 'em still sleepin', so I had to shake 'em up (shake 'em up)
I kept it too real (yuh)
I wasn't fake enough (no)
My real life was a headline (headline)
Yo' real life got a deadline (deadline)
My timeline was a hashtag (yikes)
Your timeline just a hate crime
Coming in hot (yah)
Feelin' like Pac (yah)
Back in '94, when he took five shots
Too much drive to ride yo' wave
Ditch my top when I'm off that lot (skrrrt)
Black on black on black on black on black on black on black
You don't have to ball or rap to get them racks on racks (no)
Uber poolers tryna catch my vibe and find my way (yuh, yuh)
Yeah, I know I know I'm rachet but I'm really saved
Hot sauce drippin' (drip)
E'rybody wan' start dippin' (dip)
First, nobody wan' listen (shh)
Now e'rybody pay attention
Now e'rybody pay a fee (sheesh)
Even Trump gotta take a knee (sheesh)
When the horn blow y'all gon' see
Make the wall fall down like yee!
I don't do the most but I do a lot (do it)
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive (wassup?)
No Big (nah), I feel like Pac (Pac)
I shoot the shot (Brr, brr, brr)
I'm coming in hot
Coming in hot (coming in hot)
Shoot that shot (shoot that shot)
Shoot, why not? (Ayy why not?)
Ain't no Big (ain't no Big), feel like Pac (feelin' like Pac)
We can't lose, we can't stop (we can't stop)
Yeah, coming in hot
Coming in hot
Coming in hot
Coming in hot!
Shoot that shoot
