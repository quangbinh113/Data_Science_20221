Song Name: obvious
I hope it's not obvious
My friends they all called it
Sayin' I'd end up falling for you
I'm doin' my best to hide these feelings
Confessing is the last thing that I want to do
I know I can't be crushin' on a girl who can't be here for long
So I told myself I should just stay away
But these lyrics keep comin' out
I don't think I can stop it now
I wonder if they'll get to you one day
But I'll sing these words I'll never say
'Cause that's the only way
For me to say those words
Just wait and see they'll come for sure
I'm too shy to look you in your eyes
I swear that I'm not lyin' 'cause I knew it's true
From the first time we met I'm so in love with
Everything you say and all the doodles that you post
And every time you sing a song the people crowd a little closer to you
I wish we were closer too
But I know I should be movin' on
Cause you wont be here for very long
And there's no way I could ever make you stay
But at least I'll write this song for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
And I'm hopin' that for you it's okay
If I sing these words I'll never say
'Cause that's the only way
For me to say those words
Just wait and see they'll come for sure
I'm too shy to look you in your eyes
I swear that I'm not lyin' 'cause I knew it's true
From the first time we met I'm so in love with
Time flies way too fast
I've tried to make it last
But your flyin' out in a few more days
But you should know that
My time with you was all that I wanted my summer to be
And even if you're not here with me
I still mean these words I'll never say
You're special in a way to me I can't deny it
But lately I've been tired of hiding
I know you don't feel the same
But I need to get myself to
Say the words I've known they're true
Since the day we met
I've been so in love with
You, you, you, you
Since the day we met
I've been so in love with you
