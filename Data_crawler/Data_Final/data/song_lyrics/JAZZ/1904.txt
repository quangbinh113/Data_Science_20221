Song Name: One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)
(Hey John)
(Yes sir?)
(Come on let's have a drink)
(If you insist)
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place except you and me
Set 'em up, Joe,
You know John I've got a little story that you ought know
Maybe you've heard about this
We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
(I'm telling you, this is what happened)
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine (Oh no, you too?)
So drop another nickel in the machine
Men I'm feeling so bad
I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
I Could tell you a lot (You too?)
But you've got to be true to your code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away

(Let's have another drink, bartender flow it up in here would you?)

That's how it goes
John I know your getting pretty anxious to close (John: You don't know me well then)
Tony thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
'Cause this torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
That long, long road
