Song Name: I Could Write a Book
If they ask me
I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper
And look
I could write a preface
On how we met
Then the world would never forget
And the simple secret of a plot
Is just to tell that them I love you a lot
And the world discovers
When my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that
I love you a lot
And the world discovers when my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends
How to make two lovers of friends
