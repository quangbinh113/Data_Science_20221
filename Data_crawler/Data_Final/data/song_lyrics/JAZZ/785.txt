Song Name: B.S. (feat. H.E.R.)
Yeah
Yeah
Uh
Back on my b-
Done dealing with you

Yeah
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you
Don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back
It seem like I give so much
And don't get nothin' back
I really thought it was love
But you're so fuckin' wack
Always get caught up in love
But I am done with that
I can't get caught up in lust
So now I'm, yeah
Flexin' on my exes, in my model X
Pretty little skinny, little bitty model-esque
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes
Back on my bullshit
Back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown
Got nothing to lose
I am on my own now
I am in control now
I need you to go now
I can fix my own crown
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you
Don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)
Seen you with your ex
I see you still about your old ways
Might just see him for the weekend
You say that's a coldplay
I be feelin' triggered, I
Don't know how to let it go
Really you ain't shit and, I
Know I'm too emotional, hey (Hey)
Puttin' me through it
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it
He be comin' through with it
And I hope you cool with it
I just met your roommate
Put him on my to-do list
Doin' me
Back up on some new shit
Everything in between
I'm out here, I'm gettin' stupid
I'm done bein' exclusive, and
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless
I'm back on my
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Out her actin' foolish, like I'm seventeen
I just bought a new whip
Don't need gasoline (Yeah)
I just seen your new bitch
It boost my self-esteem (Oh, babe)
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)
Flex on my ex, in my model X
Flex on my ex, in my model X
Flex on my-, flex on my-
Flex on my-
You know I'm
Back on my bullshit

Oh-oh-oh
Done dealing with you, so I'm back
