Song Name: Pain
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
I think my vision's getting blurry, swear the reaper's in a hurry
Yeah I say I got no worries but feels like nothing's gonna cure me
I don't really know why, been so damn sick of this ride
Just want off so I can feel normal for once
Fantasize about grippin' the gun
And I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling
I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling, no, no
Voices shout in my head
I don't want no more pain
Voices shout in my head
I don't want no more
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
I've been living by myself, my parents saying find help
But therapy is kinda scary, yeah that's what my brain repelled
I've been living sedentary, driving past the cemetery
Couple feet right from my house, if that's the end then I want out
I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling
I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling, no, no
Voices shout in my head
I don't want no more pain
Voices shout in my head
I don't want no more
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
