Song Name: Don't Wait Up
Do you remember how we lit up the room?
And how you felt before you met all my different moods?
But now I drive you mad when I hit you with the truth
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Don't let your mind think it's someone else, someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Why, won't you put down your phone and look me in the eye?
Got all dressed up for you, but you seem so occupied
Maybe space is all it takes, it's time to fix us
Don't let your mind think it's someone else, someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up
First I kissed you
Then I got mad at you
'Cause I wish I'd
Be happy without you
If I ditch you
Then maybe you would understand
Then maybe you would understand
I need to do something for myself, oh
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up
