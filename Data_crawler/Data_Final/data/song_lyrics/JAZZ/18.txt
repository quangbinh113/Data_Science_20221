Song Name: Paris
Let's fall in love and sing French songs in the rain
Smoke cigarettes and get drunk on champagne
Let's fuck so loud that the neighbors complain
Spend our days under snow white duvets
Let's fall in love and get high at the Louvre
Talk through the night and sleep in 'til noon
Let's scratch our names on the church walls and bells
Empty our pockets on all-black Chanel
Qui tombe, qui tombe
Qui tombe, oh, I know
Qui tombe
My baby, I'm falling for you
Qui tombe, qui tombe
Qui tombe, oh, I know
Qui tombe
My baby, I'm falling for you
