Song Name: Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)
(In other words hold my hand, please be true, I love you)
Won't you fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand, uhuh
In other words
Darling kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Yes be true, mmmh
In other words
I love you
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please be true, yes
In other words
I love
You (oh, oh, fly me to the moon)
