Song Name: Some of These Days
Some of these days
You're gonna miss me baby.
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely.
You'll miss my huggin'
You'll miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I'm go away
You'll feel so lonely
Just for me only
But you know, honey
You always had your way
And when you leave me
Oh you know, you gonna greed me
Gonna miss, your sweet sweet girl
Some of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I'm gone away
You'll feel so lonely
Just for me only
But you know, honey
You always have your way
And when you leave me
Oh you know, you gonna greed me
You gonna miss your sweet sweet girl
Some of these days
