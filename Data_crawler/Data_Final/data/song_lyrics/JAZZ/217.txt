Song Name: Inside the Lines
Worried sky
In need of something green to sleep at night
Aiming high
We're living restless but it's you and I
Can see we are
The shade
The fire and rain
True work of art
It's not a thing we change
Aiming high
We're living restless but it's you and I
Tried to keep our colours
Inside the lines
Inside the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions
In troubled minds
Inside the lines
Bold and brave
Compared to others
We just paint them grey, uh-uh
Here to stay
Know that the two of us
Won't fade away (Fade away)
Can see we are
The shade
The fire and rain
True work of art
It's not a thing we change
Hard to hide
You move me like the moon that pulls the tide
Tried to keep our colours
Inside the lines
Inside the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions
In troubled minds
Inside the lines
