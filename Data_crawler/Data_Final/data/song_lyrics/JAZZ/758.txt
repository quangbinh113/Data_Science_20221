Song Name: I Didn't Know I Was Looking for Love
I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought that love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary, confinement
So when we met, I was getting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love
'Cause there you stood, and I would oh I wonder could I say
How I felt and not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
Never knew how much that I have missed them
Slap, on the lap, of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love
So we build from here with love the foundation
In the world of tears, one constellation
Now you're here and there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
But if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless, boundless, I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love
Ooh
Ooh
