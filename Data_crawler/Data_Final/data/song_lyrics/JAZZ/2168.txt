Song Name: All Of Me
All of me
Why not take all of me?
Baby, Can't you see
That I'm no good without you.
Take my lips
Never never lose them
Take my arms
Never use them
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Go on here without you without you?
You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not
Why not take all of me?
All of me
Why not take all of me?
Baby, Can't you see
That I'm no good without you.
Take my lips
Never never lose them
Take my arms
Never use them
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Go on here without you without you?
You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not
Take all of me?
