Song Name: idfc
Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fuckin' care at all
And you been out all night, I don't know where you've been
You're slurrin' all your words, not makin' any sense
But I don't fuckin' care at all
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fuckin' care
'Cause I'm so fuckin' scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fuckin' care, I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care
So tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me even though it's fuckin' fake
I don't fuckin' care at all, a-a-a-all
And you been out all night, I don't know where you've been
You're probably gettin' fucked, you probably givin' head
And I don't fuckin' care at all
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fuckin' care, I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care
At all
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Mmm
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm only a fool for you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
But I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care
