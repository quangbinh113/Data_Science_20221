Song Name: drivers license
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine, how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone?
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
Oh-uh, and I just can't imagine, how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone?
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Sidewalks
We crossedã…¤
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, now we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
Now that I'm gone?
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
