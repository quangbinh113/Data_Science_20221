Song Name: Strawberries and Wine - Acoustic
She likes chocolate covered strawberries and wine
She likes notes that say, "I love you" all the time
Roses at your feet
Baby girl, be mine
Baby girl, be mine
Pick up your phone I need your attention
My girl so bad we call her detention
I am so glad we moved beyond friendship
And your mama like me
Look I squared up with Cupid told him, "Fight me"
I stole your love, he shot my heart
I'm losing breath, it's getting dark
I think I might need CPR
Baby won't you tell me, do you love me like I do?
Tell me what you willing to prove
'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
It's true that you mean the world to me, yeah
I traveled round the globe, but I know that you're the only girl for me
And I gotta let you know that, yeah, baby, yeah
