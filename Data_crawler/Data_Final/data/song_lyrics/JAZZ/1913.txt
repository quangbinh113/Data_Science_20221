Song Name: Come Saturday Morning (From "The Sterile Cuckoo")
Come Saturday morning
I'm going away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend more than half of the day
Just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone
Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-laugh more than half of the day
Just I and my friend
Dressed up in our rings and our Saturday things
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone
We will remember long after Saturday is gone
