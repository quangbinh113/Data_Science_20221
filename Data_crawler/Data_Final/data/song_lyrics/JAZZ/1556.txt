Song Name: I Remember You
I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said I love you too
I do, didn't you know
I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell like rain out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them, I remember you
I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell like rain out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them, I remember you
