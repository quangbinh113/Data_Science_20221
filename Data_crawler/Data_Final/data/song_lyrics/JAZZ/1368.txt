Song Name: I Put A Spell On You
I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-n-duh-duh-uah
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lying
No, I ain't lying
You know I can't stand it
Your running around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it
'Cause you put me down
Yeah, yeah
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You're mine
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you really high and wide
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now
You hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
