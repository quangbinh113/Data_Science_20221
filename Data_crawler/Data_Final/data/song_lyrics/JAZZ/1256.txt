Song Name: Cold Heart - PNAU Remix
(Oh)

(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things looking better, baby
Just passing through (oh, no, no, no, no)
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it but I kept it hid
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Something's looking better, baby
Just passing through (oh, no, no, no, no)
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it but I kept it hid
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things looking better, baby
Just passing through (oh, no, no, no, no)
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
Well, I thought it but I kept it hid
(No, no, no, no)
Shoorah (oh), shoorah
Shoorah, shoorah
Oh, no, no, no, no
