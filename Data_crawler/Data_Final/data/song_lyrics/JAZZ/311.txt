Song Name: Mad Love
Boy, you lookin' like my type
But tell me, can you hit it right?
'Cause if I let you in tonight
You better put it do-do-down, do-do-down
Now we're through with all the talk
I ain't playing anymore
You heard me when I said before
You better put it do-do-down, do-do-down
Make me say
You the one I like, like, like, like
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine
Keep it up all night, night, night, night
Don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
You come over, we could chill
Tell each other how we feel
But babe you know I love the thrill
When you put it do-do-down, do-do-down
I'm alright on my own
But with you I'm in the zone
One shot, don't let it go
You better put it do-do-down, do-do-down
Make me say
You know what I like, like, like, like
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine
Keep it up all night, night, night, night
Don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
If I back up, can you handle?
Get it all night, gimme mad love
Don't be too nice, better man up
No, don't let me down, do-do-down
If I back up, can you handle?
Get it all night, give me mad love
Don't be too nice, better man up
No, don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
All night gimme mad love
Yeah, don't let me down, do-do-down
Make me say
You the one I like, like, like, like
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine
Keep it up all night, night, night, night
Don't let me down, do-do-down
If I back up, can you handle? (You know what I like, like, like, like)
Get it all night
Give me mad love (come with your body on mine, mine, mine, mine)
Don't be too nice
Better man up (keep it up all night, night, night, night)
No, don't let me down, do-do-down
