Song Name: Bye Bye Blackbird
Gonna pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar is sweet, so is he
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me
So make my bed, light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye
I'm gonna pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and so is he
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me
So make my bed, light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye
