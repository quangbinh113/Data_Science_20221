Song Name: Creature (feat. Swae Lee)
Shoutout 808Melo
Yeah
(Shut this shit down)
When I'm on that, you know I'm on it
The drac' on me, draggin' my feet
Hop in that whip, I'm 'bout the see you
I'm like a creature, I'm on the creep
If I don't get all of my chips, I can't leave just yet
Get that top, then I dip, I'mma leave her wet
I put plates on my neck, like tectonics
I put plates on my whip, it's a rocket ship
Said draco hypnotic
You know I love niggas, gon' pop shit
Louie my body
That be why shawty is clockin' me, clockin' me
I don't owe no apology
I'm everywhere that be dollars be, dollars be
I don't owe no apology
I'm gettin' the money, you know my philosophy
Look, bend her over, blow her back out
Bend her over, pull her tracks out
She know the woo make her tap out
I really live what I rap 'bout
I remember them days in the trap house
Yeah, it got real in the trap house
I went and did some time in the jail
Because I'd rather take the fast route
If you wanna open up bets then I'm open up TD
She like papi all I got is CD
I'm like fuck it, come give me head
I back out and nut on her titty
Ayy, huh, she say I'm a dog, so I'm chasin' her kitty
Light up the smoke like a dutch in the city
I keep two in the head, we gon' catch him like Ricky
Man down
Throw the piece to my bro, that's a hand down
Help him shoot on the lot, make him camp down
He was talkin' back then, he a fan now
I keep nothin' but blues in these pants now
Rubber band for these racks and these bands now
We keep sticks and these drums, like a band now
My new bitch exotic (exotic)
My new bitch exotic (exotic)
You ain't poppin', stop it
Fresh as fuck, no stylist
Niggas stealin' styles, jackin', jockin'
This watch don't do tick tockin'
Niggas know how we rockin'
20k for Amiri's and that's for the jeans
The money was dirty
I got into rapping and now this shit clean
Now I'm on the scene
I made her top me, I know that this dick turned the bitch to a fiend
When I'm on that, you know I'm on it
The drac' on me, draggin' my feet
Hop in that whip, I'm 'bout the see you
I'm like a creature, I'm on the creep
You know I'm on it
The drac' on me, draggin' my feet
Hop in that whip, I'm 'bout the see you
I'm like a creature, I'm on the creep
We livin' life, don't panic
She love the life, don't panic
Before the grave, turn the money to ashes
I just fucked on an actress
Muthafuckas start scattering
All the paper start to scatter
I be doin' all that cashin'
I be doin' all that bashin'
When I'm on that, you know I'm on it
The drac' on me, draggin' my feet
Hop in that whip, I'm 'bout the see you
I'm like a creature, I'm on the creep
You know I'm on it
The drac' on me, draggin' my feet
Hop in that whip, I'm 'bout the see you
I'm like a creature, I'm on the creep
