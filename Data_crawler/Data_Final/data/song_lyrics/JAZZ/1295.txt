Song Name: Stripes
We work when we work, somehow it works
For what it's worth, we work it out
Worse comes to worst, we'll be worse for wear
Word to the wise, we're worth the route
West of wherever we're about to be
Where our whereabouts and our wishes meet
Somewhere like summer (somewhere like summer)
When in Rome, why not roam?
When in Rome
Tell me where you want to go, tell me where you want to go
West of wherever we're about to be
Where our whereabouts and our wishes meet
Somewhere like summer (somewhere like summer)
When in Rome (when in Rome), why not roam? (Why not roam?)
When in Rome
Tell me where you want to go, tell me where you want to go
We work when we work, somehow it works
For what it's worth, we work it out
Worse comes to worst, we'll be worse for wear
Word to the wise, we're worth the route
