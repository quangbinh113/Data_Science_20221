Song Name: Call Me Irresponsible
Call me irresponsible
Call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you?
Well I'm not too clever
I just adore you
Call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible
Yes I'm unreliable
But it's
