Song Name: The Nearness of You
It's not the pale moon
That excites me
That thrills and delights me
Oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation
Oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams
Came true
I need no soft lights
To enchant me
If you would only grant me
The right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you
