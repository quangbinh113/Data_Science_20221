Song Name: Yesterday (Bossa Version)
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the girl I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me oh yesterday came suddenly
Why he had to go I don't know he wouldn't say
I did something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away oh I believe in yesterday
Why he had to go...
Yesterday
