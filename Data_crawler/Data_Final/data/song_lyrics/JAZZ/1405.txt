Song Name: Isn't This A Lovely Day
The weather is frightening, the thunder and lightning,
Seem to be having their way,
But as far as I'm concerned it's a lovely day.
The turn in the weather will keep us together,
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day,
And everything's okay.
Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke, and oh, what a break for me.
I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in the storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.
Let the rain pitter-patter but it really doesn't matter,
If the skies are gray.
As long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.
