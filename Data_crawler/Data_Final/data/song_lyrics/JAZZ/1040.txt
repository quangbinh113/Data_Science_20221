Song Name: What You Don't Do - Tom Misch Remix
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
Heavy words, little lies
Telling everything but the truth, the truth
Three little words over time overheard and overused, used
No sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
No grand gesture could ever be made to measure you
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
The closer we get, oh
The less we need to show
The closer we get, oh
The less we need to show
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, I know you love me, I don't need proof
(Proof, proof, proof)
