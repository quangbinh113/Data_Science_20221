Song Name: Old Fashioned
I know it's not very cool
Standing here, serenading like a fool
But I don't care
I'll gladly be a fool for you
I know the idea isn't new
To fall in love with someone on first view
But I don't care
I think I'll fall in love with you
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favourite dress
I'll take you somewhere new
I'll be old-fashioned for you
It's a clich√© or so I'm told
To give your jacket up to someone when it's cold
But I don't care
I don't mind the midnight air
Oh, oh
I'll walk you home, to your front door
I'll say farewell until the morning calls
I'll be smiling a bigger smile than before
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favourite dress
And I'll take you somewhere new
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favourite dress
And I'll take you somewhere new
I'll be old fashioned for you
Old fashioned for you
