Song Name: I'll Sleep When I'm Older
The taste of a cigarette in Paris in spring
Conversation with elders and the wisdom they bring
Sunrise in Georgia as holy choirs sing
The view from an aeroplane at twelve thousand feet
Meet God on a mountain top along with the stars
Find love somewhere, anywhere, fall deep from the start
Misplace my mind and follow my heart
See the cosmos unfolding and know I'm a part
I'll sleep when I'm older
When the world's got me weathered
I'll finally find my way home
I'll sleep when I'm older
Sleep when I'm older
I'll be a firework, not a flickering flame
Treat life all around me like a one-player game
I'll go to the party and forget all the names
Should it climb back to haunt me, it ends all the same
I'll sleep when I'm older
When the world's got me weathered
I'll finally find my way home
I'll sleep when I'm older

(Older)

I'll sleep when I'm older
I'll sleep when I'm older
I'll sleep when I'm older
Sleep when I'm older
