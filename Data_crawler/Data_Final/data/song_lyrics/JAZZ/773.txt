Song Name: Sweet Dreams
Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This
Who am I to disagree?
I Travel The World
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.
Some Of Them Want To Use You
Some Of Them Want To
Get Used By You
Some Of Them Want To Abuse You
Some Of Them Want To Be Abused.
Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This
Who am I to disagree?
I Travel The World
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.
(MUSIC)
Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This
Who am I to disagree?
I Travel The World
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.
(MUSIC)
(Hold Your Head Up--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up).
(MUSIC)
Some Of Them Want To Use You
Some Of Them Want To
Get Used By You
Some Of Them Want To Abuse You
Some Of Them Want To Be Abused.
(Hold Your Head Up--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up--Movin' On)
(Hold Your Head Up--Movin' On--
Keep Your Head Up).
Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This
Who am I to disagree?
I Travel The World
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.
(Repeat X5)
