Song Name: Woman of the Ghetto - Akshin Alizadeh Remix
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray for once and I'm from the ghetto
We call 'em all jokes and we play drums and playing these drums
You know that he's a sinner, hmm
I saw a stash all long gone, gone, gone with the keys
What a blessing oh and all love
And all love
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray (pray, pray)
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray (pray)
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
You know
You know
You know
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
And help me pray (pray, help me pray)
