Song Name: Love For Sale
When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belongs to a lonesome cop
She opens shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
She goes to work
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample her supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
She's been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love, but true love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy her wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
She's been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love, but true love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love for sale, honey
If you want to buy her wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
