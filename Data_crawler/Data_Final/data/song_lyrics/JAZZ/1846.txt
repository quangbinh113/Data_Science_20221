Song Name: Come Fly With Me
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama-land there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer because we're together
And weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Come on fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come on fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Just say the words and we'll beat those birds
Down to Guanabara Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly
Come on fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Come on fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come on fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
