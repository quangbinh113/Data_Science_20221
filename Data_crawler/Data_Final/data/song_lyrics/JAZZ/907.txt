Song Name: Big (feat. Gunna)
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Pickin' up the money always callin' (always callin')
She gon' touch the ceiling for a sinner (for a sinner)
Dark chains and a blurry morning
Ready on that meet me in the lobby (in the lobby)
Yeah, from the bass, she gon' ride it like a trolley (like a trolley)
X Games when we skate off in the 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt)
Big tanks looking like transformers
Midnight, come get right, on this side
Freak, freak, like my name, Giannis
You gon' know about it when we come through
Bad bitches coming in twos
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof
Red bottoms up on those shoes
Licking off shops like (do-do)
The way we run through, yeah, yeah

Big enough for me to call you papa (call you papa)
Poppin' like I'm over out in Baca
Need the head like medulla oblongata
Gucci like I'm made in Florence
More tequila, I'ma need a driver (need a driver)
Big timer, gave me all his Prada (all his Prada)
Every diamond on me, yeah, I bought it (yeah, I bought it)
Say it twice so I know you want it
Midnight, come get right, on this side
Freak, freak, like my name, Giannis
You gon' know about it when we come through
Bad bitches coming in twos
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof
Red bottoms up on those shoes
Licking off shops like (do-do)
The way we run through, yeah, yeah
I'ma walk through, yeah
Crib with a house and a pool, yeah (pool, yeah)
Let her walk through
Bet it, I'on't think that you'd lose
I like how you move
She a ten and her skin so smooth
It's a two-door Benz and it only fit two
See it through the lens, everything brand new
Oh, you gon' know about it when we come through (come through)
Bad bitches coming in twos (in two)
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do (yeah, yeah)
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof (out the sun roof)
Red bottoms up on those shoes (up on those shoes)
Licking off shops like (do-do)
The way we run through, yeah, yeah
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Bl-blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
When we run through, yeah, yeah
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Bl-blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
When we run through, yeah, yeah
