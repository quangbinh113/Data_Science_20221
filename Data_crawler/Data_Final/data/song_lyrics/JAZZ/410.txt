Song Name: Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat) [BTS Remix]
BTS
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
If I woke up without you, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
Every night and every day (and every day)
I try to make you stay but your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that, your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that
사랑이란 어쩌면 순간의 감정의 나열
조건이 다들 붙지 난 뭘 사랑하는가
영원이라는 말은 어쩌면 모래성
잔잔한 파도 앞에 힘없이 무너져
Every night, every day, I'm swept away by the waves
Don't know what I'm thinking (can't get you outta my head)
내가 두려운 게 그대이든 그때이든
불같이 사랑할래 그댈 지금
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay but your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that, your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love
(Ooh-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la)
Your savage lo-lo-love (ooh-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la)
Your savage lo-lo-love (ooh-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la)
You could use me, baby (ooh, la-la-la-la)
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that, your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love
