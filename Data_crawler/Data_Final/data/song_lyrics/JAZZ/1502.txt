Song Name: How Long
Friday night in a busy bar
You enter with guitar and that leather jacket
A shy invite to dance one time, so unexpected
Mmmm, how long, how long
Foo-do-do-die, since I've met you
How long, how long has that been
New York streets and Paris lights
Barcelona warm long nights
Together we from sight to sight connected
Irish fields and green lush grass
The mountain tops where there's only us
You get down on one knee and ask
And I accept it
How long, how long
Foo-do-do-die, since I've met you
How long, how long has that been
Me and you, here and there
On a two different sides of the planet
From the clay we separate and reunite together
How long, how long
Foo-do-do-die, since I've met you
How long, how long has that been
