Song Name: September In The Rain
The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down, remember
In September
In the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That September
In the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed
To play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
Uhhh that September
In the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
That September
In the rain
I said that September
In the rain
