Song Name: Superstar
I heard that you're moving on now
You sit alone
Hard to find what you're looking for
But I heard that you're doing better now
We're happier when divided
In the dark, you've been going through phases
Hope you love the one you make love to
Making sure that you're not the one broken
But I guess I wasn't perfect
I'll make it easier
And take the blame, go ahead, take the credits
Afraid to fall in love, you should let it
Tear you apart baby, you deserve it
I'm a superstar
Know you can't stand it superstar
Though we could've had something, babe
Just forget about it
Just forget about it
Don't wanna see me happier than them
I'm sorry to say I let you down
Ain't worried bout the pictures in your phone
Or feelings soon to be expired
And don't apologize for the calls you been missing now
Not wasting time on the things I could do without
I hate to go, hate to tell you
I picked up all the pieces that were left behind
I'll make it easier
And take the blame, go ahead, take the credits
Afraid to fall in love, you should let it
Tear you apart baby, you deserve it
I'm a superstar
Know you can't stand it superstar
Though we could've had something, babe
Just forget about it
Just forget about it
Ooh, whoa
Hate to go, hate to tell you I told you so
You say you need me, I'm sure
But that's nothing that I should know
Ooh, whoa
Hate to go, hate to tell you I told you so
You say you need me, I'm sure
But that's nothing that I should know
