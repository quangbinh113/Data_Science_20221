Song Name: My Jinji
Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
I won't be too late
My Jinji don't you cry
This world out of time
Of time out of mind
My Jinji please don't cry
In this world, out of time
Time out of mind
(Out of mind)
Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
I'm down to the drain
(Oh)
Jinji don't you cry
This world out of time
Old time out of mind
My Jinji please don't lie
In this world out of time
Time out of mind
(Out of mind)
Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
It won't be too late
Oh, don't leave me behind
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh, sometimes I
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Oh, don't leave me behind
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh, sometimes I
Without you, I will cry
'Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
