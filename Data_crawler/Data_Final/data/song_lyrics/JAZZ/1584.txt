Song Name: Love for Sale - 2010 Remaster
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh, still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise? Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Everything but true
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you wanna try my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs, love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Everything but true
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you wanna try my wares
Come with me and climb the stairs, love for sale
Love for sale, love for sale
