Song Name: Here Comes the Sun
Here comes the sun little darlin'
Here comes the sun
I say, "It's alright, it's alright"
Here comes the sun little darlin'
Here comes the sun
I say, "It's alright, it's alright"
Little darlin', it's been a long, cold, and lonely winter
Little darlin', it feels like years since you've been here
Here comes the sun little darlin'
Here comes the sun
I say, "It's alright, it's alright"
Little darlin', the smiles
Have returned to the faces now
Little darlin', it seems like
Years since you've been here
Little darlin', it's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darlin', it feels like years since you've been here
Here comes the sun
Aren't you glad to see it
I say, "It's alright"
Here comes the sun little darlin'
I say, "It's alright"
Little darlin', here comes the sun, yeah
Here comes the sun, I say, "Little darlin'"
It seems like years since you've been here
Little darlin', here comes the sun
Oh, baby it's alright now, you can come on out now
And it's alright now, you can come on out now
It's alright-
