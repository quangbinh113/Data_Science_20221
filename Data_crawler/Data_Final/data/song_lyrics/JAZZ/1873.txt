Song Name: A Sunday Kind Of Love
I wanna Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
I wanna Sunday kind of love
I wanna love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonley road that leads me no where
I need a Sunday kind of love
I do my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday schemeing
Every minute
Every hour of
Everyday
I'm hopeing to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays are cold
A love for all my life to
Have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love
I do my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday schemeing
Every minute
Every hour of
Everyday
I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when
Mondays are cold
A love for all my life
To have and to hold
I wanna Sunday
I need a Sunday
I want a Sunday
Kind of love
