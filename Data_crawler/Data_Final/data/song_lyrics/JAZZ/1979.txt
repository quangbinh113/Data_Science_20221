Song Name: Puttin' On The Ritz
If you're blue and you don't know where to go towhy don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz.
Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripesand cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz.
That's where... Every Sunday Evening with their Swell clothes, Rubbing elbowsCome let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticksor "umberellas" in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz.
If you're blue and you don't know where to go towhy don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz.
