Song Name: Like a Virgin
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
But didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was bein' incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Like a virgin, wuh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me
Oh
Oh
Like a virgin
Oh
When you hold me
Feels so good inside
