Song Name: It's Too Late
Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time
There's something wrong here there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin'
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh oh oh
It used to be so easy livin' here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
But it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh oh oh, na na na na na na
Do-do-do-do-do
(La-la-la-la-la)
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you
But it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh oh oh, no-no-no-no-no
Do-do-do-do-do
(La-la-la-la-la)
It's too late
Baby
It's too late
Ho now darlin'
It's too late...
