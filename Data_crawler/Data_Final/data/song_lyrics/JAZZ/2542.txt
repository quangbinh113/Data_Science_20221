Song Name: On The Sunny Side Of The Street
Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.
If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller.
Gonna set my feet
On the sunny side of the street.
Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Live can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.
If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street.
