Song Name: It Never Entered My Mind - Remastered/1994
Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You heard what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch
My back myself
Once you warned me that if you score me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again
It never entered my mind.
