Song Name: Constant
I don't know why people go
It's a shame
And it's usually the people
That say they'd never change
That's when you told me that the storms will come
We just gotta learn to dance in the rain
Then you said
Don't worry, 'cause babe
You got me, and I
I'm stayin' right here
And though the season's change
My love will stay the same
For you, yes it's true
You're the only constant thing in my world
When there's no one left around
It's just me and my girl
I know that change is just a part of this life
But our love will stand the test of time
'Cause baby, you're my constant, constant
Darlin' you're my constant, constant
It's an unpredictable life on my own
I can be surrounded by many
But still feel alone
That's when you told me
That you'd always be there for me
And I'm always coming back
To the one I call home
You're the only constant thing in my world
When there's no one left around
It's just me and my girl
I know that change is just a part of this life
But our love will stand the test of time
'Cause baby, you're my constant, constant
Darlin' you're my constant, constant
(I'll be your constant, constant)
(Baby you're my constant girl)
(Darlin' you're my constant, constant)
