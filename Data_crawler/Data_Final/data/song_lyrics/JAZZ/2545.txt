Song Name: Moonglow
It must have been moon glow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moon glow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I started praying
Oh Lord, please let this last
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'rywhere
And now when there's moon glow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moon glow gave me you
It must have been moon glow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moon glow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I started praying
Oh Lord, please let this last
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'rywhere
And now when there's moon glow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moon glow brought me you
