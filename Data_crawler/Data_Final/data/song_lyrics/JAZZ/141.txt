Song Name: Clouds
Time tried to stop one cold, cold night in June
Somehow I knew you kept on dancing through
And you jumped on a flight in the darkest of blues
Took a trip to paradise through the stars and back over the moon
Oh, tell me it's true, oh
Please just tell me you're alright

Are you way up in the sky?
Laughing, smiling, looking down
Saying, "One day we'll meet in the clouds"
Up in the clouds
No one I knew stood half as bright as you

But now you shine on the perfect avenue
And the light that you left, it helps me to see
A way through all the bitterness, a way to who I really want to be
Oh, light up the streets, oh
Please just tell me you're alright
Are you way up in the sky?
Laughing, smiling, looking down
Saying, "One day we'll meet in the clouds"
Up in the clouds
Up in the clouds, yeah

Some nights I still hear your whispers
And your memories, they hang like a picture
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You'll always be just like a sister
Some nights I still see your smile
Your number, I wish I could dial
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But I can't wait to talk for a while
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Please just tell me you're alright

Are you way up in the sky?
Laughing, smiling, looking down
I know one day we'll meet in the clouds
Up in the clouds
