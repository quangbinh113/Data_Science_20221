Song Name: Natural
Just like the water flowing in the river
Just like when the spring has to turn to summer
Feels like the song 'You're Always In My Hair'
As long as you're smiling, that is all I care
Sometimes it hurts like growing pain
At times it makes me cry like the rain
But I'd cross the ocean if I have to
I'd run through the storm
To get to you right now
It's so natural to love you
Just like the gravity that's pulling me down
I'm always gon' be right there
To hold you down, down, down
Just like the song 'You're My Ribbon in the Sky'
As long as you're with me, that is all I care
Sometimes it hurts like growing pain (sometimes it hurts)
At times it makes me cry like the rain
But I'd cross the ocean if I have to
I'd run through the storm
To get to you right now
It's so natural to love you
So natural to love you
So natural to love you
So natural
So natural to love you
To love you
