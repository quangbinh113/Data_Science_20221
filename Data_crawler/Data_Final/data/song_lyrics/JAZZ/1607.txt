Song Name: April In Paris
April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
Evening melodies
April in Paris, this is a feeling
No one could ever reprieve
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace
'Til, April in Paris
Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?
So, I never knew the charm of spring, ah-ah
Never met it face to face, ah-ah
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace
'Til, April in Paris

Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?
