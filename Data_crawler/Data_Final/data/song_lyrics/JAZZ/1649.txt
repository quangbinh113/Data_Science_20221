Song Name: Brown Sugar - Incognito Molasses Mix
Let me tell you 'bout this girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See we be makin' love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade, blood burgundy
The way that we kiss is unlike any other way that I be kissin'
What I'm kissin', what I'm missin', won't you listen
Brown Sugar, babe
I gets high off your love, I don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
Oh, Sugar, when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with the coco eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Ty
Brown Sugar, babe
I gets high off your love, don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
Now that be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open now I want some more
Always down for a ménage à trois
But I think I'ma hit it solo, hope my niggas don't mind
Stick out my tongue and I'm 'bout ready to hit this gritty pretty bitty with my sisters
(Yo, I don't think y'all hear me)
Brown Sugar, babe
I gets high off your love, don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (sugar)
