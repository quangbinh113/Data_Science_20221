Song Name: Why Do People Fall In Love/People
Why do people... fall in love?
When does the feeling first begin,
That found a way to my heart,
And make the music start the second she walked in?
Where do we get this sensation?
Who designed the combination
The desire when she's near,
The everlasting fear,
That one day she would say goodbye.
It's gotta make you wonder,
Why do people fall in love?
When do they lose their self-control?
Is there some power in a touch,
That sends a crazy rush,
Running through my soul?
What do you call this condition,
When it hurts so good inside?
I really wanna know,
Can someone tell me why...
Why do people fall in love?
What little bell goes off inside?
Can't we find better things to do, something safe and new that I haven't tried?
But here am I needing someone
And I need you till I die.
People fall in love.
When they fall in love...
People, people who need people are the luckiest people when they fall in love!
