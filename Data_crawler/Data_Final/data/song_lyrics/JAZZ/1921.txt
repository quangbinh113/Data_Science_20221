Song Name: Something
Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover.
Something in the way she woos me, I don't wanna leave her now.
You know I believe in how...
Somewhere in her smile she knows, that I don't need no other lover.
Something in her style that shows me. I don't wanna leave her now.
You know I believe in how...
You're askin' me will my love grow, I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now, it may show. I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she moves me
Something in the way she knows, and all I have to do is think of her.
Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her now.
You know I believe in how...
