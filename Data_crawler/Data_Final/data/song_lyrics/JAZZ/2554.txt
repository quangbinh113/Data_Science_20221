Song Name: Fine And Mellow
My man don't love me
Treats me oh so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen
He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong
But if you treat me right baby
I'll stay home every day
If you treat me right baby
I'll stay home every day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone
