Song Name: 24K Magic
Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players, put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!
Pop pop, it's show time (show time)
Show time (show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh, they don't know? (Go on, tell 'em)
Oh, they don't know? (Go on, tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (sho'nuff)
Wearing Cuban links (yeah)
Designer minks (yeah)
Inglewood's finest shoes (whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the colour red the blues
Ooh, shit
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me, and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix your face
Ain't my fault that y'all be jocking (keep up)
Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon

Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out
Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas)
Gangstas (gangstas)
Bad bitches and your ugly ass friends (haha)
Can I preach? (Uh-oh)
Can I preach? (Uh-oh)
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip (sip), do your dip (dip)
Spend your money like money ain't shit, ooh-ooh (we too fresh)
Got to blame in on Jesus (hashtag blessed)
They ain't ready for me, uh
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me, and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix your face
Ain't my fault that y'all be jocking (keep up)
Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Hey girls
What y'all trying to do? (What y'all trying to do?)
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!
(Whoo!) Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player (whoo!)
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player, (ah, whoo!)
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player, ooh
Now, now, now
Watch me break it down like uh
24 karat, 24 karat magic
What's that sound?
24 karat, 24 karat magic
Come on now
24 karat, 24 karat magic
Don't fight the feeling
Invite the feeling
Just put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Tell me what y'all trying to do)
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player (hands up)
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Do)
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player (24 karat)
Uh, look out
(24 karat magic, magic, magic, magic, magic)
