Song Name: Don't Rain On My Parade
I'm gonna live
And live now
Get what I want
I know how
All that the law will allow
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw
That bell will go clang
Though I'm alone
I'm a gang
Eye on the target, and wham
One shot, one gun shot, and bam
Hey, world here I am
Don't tell me not to fly
I simply got to
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade
Don't tell me not to live
Just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's
A ball of butter
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it
But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection
Or freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion
The cinder or the
Shiny apple of its eye
I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once, right sir?
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy, and you'll see
I gotta have my bite, sir
Get ready for me, life
'Cause I'm a 'Comer'
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Nobody
Should rain on my parade
