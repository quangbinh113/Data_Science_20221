Song Name: Men In Black - From "Men In Black" Soundtrack
Woo
Here come the Men In Black
It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's
Here come the Men In Black
(Men In Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah, nah, nah
The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me, MIB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suits with the black Ray Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the MIB's is at
Uh, and
Here come the Men In Black (Men In Black)
Galaxy defenders (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Here come the Men In Black (Men In Black)
They won't let you remember (won't let you remember)
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Now, from the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom, on the impendin' doom
But then like "boom" black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer, vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MIB's, can I please?
Do what we say, that's they way we kick it
Yaknahmean? (mmm, hmm)
I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MIB's, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?)
Men In Black
Uh, and
The Men In Black
The Men In Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me
Just bounce with me (bounce with me)
Just bounce it with me
Come on, let me see ya just slide with me
Just slide with me (slide, slide)
Just slide with me (slide, slide)
Come on, let me see ya talk a walk with me
Just walk with me (walk with me)
Take a walk with me
Come on and make your neck work
Now freeze (uh-huh-huh-ha)
Here come the Men In Black (Men in black)
Galaxy defenders (oh, ooh)
Here come the Men In Black (Men in black)
They won't let you remember (no, no)
Alright check it
Let me tell you this in closin'
I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me, if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go with ya life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the men in
That's the men in
Here come the Men In Black (here they come)
Galaxy defenders (galaxy defenders)
Here come the Men In Black (oh, here they come)
They won't let you remember (won't let you remember)
Here come the Men In Black (oh, here they come)
Galaxy defenders (oh, ho, oh, ho)
Here come the Men In Black
They won't let you remember
