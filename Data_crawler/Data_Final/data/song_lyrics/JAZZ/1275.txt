Song Name: You Can't Hold Me Down
You can't hold me down
(Chorus)
You can't hold me down
Don't wanna be pushed around
Why ya'll wanna stress me for?
Can't a young man have fun anymore?
Been to more places than you ever saw
Why you always wanna keep me poor?
Can't my world be cooler than yours?
Keep a smoke inbetween my jaws
Or is it your job to point out my flaws?
Just because you got your mind on pause
Cause I ain't got no time tonight
For all the things that just ain't right
Like traffic lights and crowded trains
Tonight it just won't be the same
(Chorus2x)
Why you always wanna try and stop me?
I don't think you can really top me
Can't my car be quicker than yours?
Or is it my job to always wipe floors
Don't blame me for the way I live
My work is done, it's time to give
I don't think you should get all mad
Just because I wanna groove so bad
Cause I ain't got no time tonight
For all the things that just ain't right
Like traffic lights and crowded trains
Tonight it just won't be the same
Why you always look at me so wrong
Just because I wear my hair so long?
Can't my world be bigger than yours?
Or is it my job to always wipe floors
Can't me talk be smoother than yours
Why you always wanna shut your doors?
Cause I ain't got no time tonight
For all the things that just ain't right
Like traffic lights and crowded trains
Tonight it just won't be the same
