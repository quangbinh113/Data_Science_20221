Song Name: Remember Me
Please, allow me to show you something
Wrote you a letter
Now that I'm here without you
Hope that you're better
Hope that you found someone new
'Cause I'm getting older
Know that I've changed
And I can't go back now
Nothing's the same
But I won't forget how
You called my name
When I was afraid
And now I'm afraid
Will you remember me?
Will you remember the way that I was?
Will you remember me?
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me?
Will you remember?
Do you remember me?
Do you remember?
Will you remember me?
Last summer
We made plans like we would always be
We said by now that we'd have everything and more
I never thought that we'd be dreaming on our own
'Cause I'm getting older
Know that I've changed
And I can't go back now
Nothing's the same
But I won't forget how
You called my name
When I was afraid
And now I'm afraid
Will you remember me?
Will you remember the way that I was?
Will you remember me?
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me?
Will you remember?
Do you remember me?
Do you remember?
Will you remember me?
Will you remember?
Do you remember me?

Will you remember?
Do you remember me? (Mmm)
I think that was it
