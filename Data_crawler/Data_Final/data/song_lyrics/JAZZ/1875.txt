Song Name: Hallelujah, I Love Him So - First Sessions Outtake
Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know
He's my baby and he lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
He brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
When I'm in trouble and I got no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, "He told me so"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
If I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him on my door
In the evening 'fore the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And tells me, "Baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Oh, if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him on my door
In the evening 'fore the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And he tells me, "Baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I love him so
Don't you know? Oh
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, oh you know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, oh Lord
Hallelujah, oh
Hallelujah, I just love him
You know I love him
Hallelujah
