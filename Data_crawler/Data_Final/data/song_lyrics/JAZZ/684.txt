Song Name: Crystalised
You've applied the pressure to have me crystalised
And you've got the faith, that I could bring paradise
I'll forgive and forget before I'm paralysed
Do I have to keep up the pace to keep you satisfied?
Ay, ay
Things have gotten closer to the sun, and I've done things in small doses
So don't think that I'm pushing you away when you're the one that I've kept closest
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
You don't move slow, I'm taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echo, does it lessen your affection? No
You say I'm foolish for pushing this aside
But burn down our home, I won't leave alive
Ay, ay, ay
Glaciers have melted to the sea, I wish the tide would take me over
I've been down on my knees, and you just keep on getting closer
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay

Glaciers have melted to the sea (things have gotten closer to the sun)
I wish the tide would take me over (and I've done things in small doses)
I've been down onto my knees (so don't think that I'm pushing you away)
And you just keep on getting closer (when you're the one that I've kept closest)
Go slow, go slow, woah-oh
Go slow, go slow, woah-oh
Go slow
