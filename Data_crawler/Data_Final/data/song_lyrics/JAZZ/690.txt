Song Name: Valerie - Live At BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, London / 2007
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you find the right man
Who'll fix it for you
Are you shopping anywhere (Uh, uh)
Changed the colour of your hair (Uh, uh)
And are you busy? (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And did you have to pay that fine (Uh, uh)
That you were dodging all the time (Uh, uh)
Are you still dizzy? (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Woah, Valerie, oh Valerie, oh, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
