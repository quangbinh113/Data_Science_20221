Song Name: Breathe
Sometimes I get nervous
What will they say, what will happen?
Ooh, what will I become?
It's getting late
The moon is full, the wolves begin to cry again
Say that you'll be there for me
For me
'Cause this story's about
To breathe, to breathe, to breathe, to breathe
Breathe
Oh, breathe
To breathe
