Song Name: Do It Again feat. Carolyn Leonhart & Robert Smith
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop,
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop.
If you are looking for some adventure,
Don't you forget what you have to do,
Just take a step in the right direction,
And right away hell be there with you.
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop,
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop.
When you are playing around with fire,
Dangerous passion is what you feel,
Don't waste your time in the wrong direction,
Honesty gets you a better deal.
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love,
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Hold him, hold him, hold him fast,
Never mind if it doesn't last!
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop,
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop.
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love,
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Hold him, hold him, hold him fast,
Never mind if it doesn't last!
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop,
Aaaah!
Don't ever start it if you can't stop.
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love,
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Hold him, hold him, hold him fast,
Never mind if it doesn't last!
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love,
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Hold him, hold him, hold him fast,
Never mind if it doesn't last!
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love,
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
Hold him, hold him, hold him fast,
Never mind if it doesn't last!
Do it, do it again!
Do it, do it again with love.
