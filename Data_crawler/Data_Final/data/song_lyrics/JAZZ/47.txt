Song Name: Calypso
Does she move like air?
Yeah, I bet they stop and stare
Would she hold my hand
If I were a better man
Honey, said I'll bring you flowers
I'd really love to learn your name
Sit and talk with you for hours
Well, just name a time
Honey, said I'll bring you flowers
Would it brighten up your day
Little missy bounds for hours
Well, just name a time all day
What does she see in me
Lock them doors and throw the key
It's really something in the way
And those gray eyes, they make me pay
Honey, said I'll bring you daisies
Would you like the way they smell
Never yes-es only maybes
For Calypso, I fell
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Calypso, no way
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Calypso, no way
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Calypso, no way
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Singing Calypso
Calypso, no way
