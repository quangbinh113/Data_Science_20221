Song Name: Liquid Spirit - Claptone Remix
Clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Un-reroute the rivers
Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
So let the liquid spirit free
The people are thirsty
'Cause of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch winds
When the water hit the banks of that hard, dry land
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Clap your hands now
Liquid spirit
Un-reroute the rivers
Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
So let the liquid spirit free
The people are thirsty
'Cause of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch wind
When the water hit the banks of that hard, dry land
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Clap your hands now
