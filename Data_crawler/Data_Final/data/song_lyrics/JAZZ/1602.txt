Song Name: Audrey Tell Me
She picks me up, late at night
Her lips are shy and her cheeks are pink and white
I know that look, I've seen it before
She steps out now, slowly shuts the door
A chemical curse, courses through my veins
A wisp of her hair, tangled in my brain
And if I go, in the morning I'll want more
And if I stay, in the morning I'll just wanna say
Audrey tell me, tell me I'm your favorite guy
Audrey tell me, tell me can I go for a ride
In your pink E-30, drivin' down the 405
Audrey tell me, tell me Audrey is that alright
Destination only miles away
How much longer Audrey can I stay
The same mistake, the risk I take
It's a choice I'm ready to make
And if I go, in the morning I'll want more
And if I stay, in the morning I'll just wanna say
Audrey tell me, tell me I'm your favorite guy
Audrey tell me, tell me can I go for a ride
In your pink E-30, drivin' down the 405
Audrey tell me, tell me Audrey is that alright
There's nothing familiar, in the rear-view mirror
And our sunsets dripping off the interstate
Open the door, put it in gear
Hand on the wheel, foot to the floor
Audrey told me so
Why? I don't know
Can't be sure...
Audrey tell me, tell me I'm your favorite guy
Audrey tell me, tell me can I go for a ride
In your pink E-30, drivin' down the 405
Audrey tell me, tell me Audrey is that alright
