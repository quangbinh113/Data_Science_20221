Song Name: No More Rain (In This Cloud)
No more rain in this cloud
No more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come and I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(There's no more rain)
My sunshine has come (no more rain in this cloud)
(Let it go) And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud (no more rain)
There's no hiding place
When someone has hurt you
It's written on your face and it reads
"Broken spirit, lost and confused
Empty, scared, used and abused, a fool, oh"
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
(It's written all over your face, yeah)
And the smile you used to wear
Seems a little bit out of place (tracks of your tears)
People, oh, hold on, in time
It gets a little better, oh yeah
My sunshine has come (no more rain in this cloud)
(My sunshine) And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(There's no more rain, no, no)
My sunshine has come and I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(No more rain, no more rain)
So you want to live and to you I shall give
All the space that you requested
Hope you don't live to regret it
So you say you're in your prime
Baby, don't waste your time (no more rain)
Remember my love (no more rain)
It's only a thin line (too little, too never, too late)
My sunshine has come (no more rain)
(My sunshine) And I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
And there's no more rain in this cloud (no more rain)
(There's no more rain)
My sunshine has come (no more rain)
(My sunshine, no more rain)
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(No more rain in this cloud, no more rain)
Spring has come and winter's gone, my love
(No more rain, winter's gone)
But don't look around for me, child
I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone
(I'll be gone, gone, gone)
(No more rain) Not afraid (not afraid)
Because the seasons have changed
I'm gonna count my blessings (no more rain)
And just follow the sun 'cause you see
My sunshine has come
(Now, I wanna take a minute to kick it like this)
(Has come, y'all wit' me?)
And I'm all cried out
(Y'all know what I'm talkin' about?)
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(You know what to do, no more rain in this cloud)
My sunshine has come (no more rain, no more rain)
(There's no hiding place)
And I'm all cried out (when you're hurting)
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(No more rain in this cloud, no, no, no)
Baby, don't want tear drops
Drying upon my pillow
(I used to think the world of you)
Only room for raindrops (no more rain)
Don't belong on my smile (baby, there's)
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(Nothing I would not do)
Baby, don't want tear drops
Drying upon my pillow (You broke me down)
Only room for raindrops
Don't belong on my smile (You broke me down)
(No more rain) And there's no more rain in this cloud
(You, you, you, baby, broke me down)
My sunshine has come (Goes around, comes around)
(What goes up) And I'm all cried out (Must come down)
(Things you do) And there's no more rain in this cloud
(Come back to you, y'all believe that?) (I said)
My sunshine has come (Goes around, comes around)
(What goes up) And I'm all cried out (Must come down)
