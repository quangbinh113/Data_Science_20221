Song Name: I Put A Spell On You (Fifty Shades of Grey) - From "Fifty Shades Of Grey" Soundtrack
I put a spell on you (I put a spell on, spell, spell)
Because you're mine (because you're mine)
You better stop the things you do
I tell you, I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better, daddy
I cannot stand it 'cause you put me down, oh no
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All mine
You know I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down, ooh
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
