Song Name: Dream a Little Dream of Me
The stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear
Just saying this sweet dreams
'Til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave
All worries behind you
But in your dreams
Whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear
Just saying this sweet dreams
'Til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave
All worries behind you
But in your dreams
Whatever they be
Dream a little dream of-
Dream a little dream of-
Dream a little dream of me
Of me
Dream a little dream of me
