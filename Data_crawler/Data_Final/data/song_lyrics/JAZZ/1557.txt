Song Name: I'm Old Fashioned
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlights
I love the old fashion things
The sound of rain
Upon (a window plane?)
The story song that April sings
Where are all these years fancies?
Or passing fancies?
Still side and side
Holding hands
These, my heart
Understands i'm old fashioned
But baby I don't mind it!
For that's how I want, to be
Just as long as you, agree
To stay, old fashioned
With me
Stay old fashioned with me
(Awesome Solo Sax)
I'm old fashioned
But baby I don't mind it!
That's how I want
That's how i want, to be!
With that sound of rain
Upon my (widow pain?)
The story song that April sings
Where are all these years fancies?
Or passing fancies?
Still side and side
Holding hands
These, my heart
Understands I'm old fashioned
But baby I don't mind it!
For that's how i want, to be
Just as long as you, agree
To stay old fashioned
Won't you stay old fashioned?
Stay old fashioned
With me
Stay old fashioned with me
