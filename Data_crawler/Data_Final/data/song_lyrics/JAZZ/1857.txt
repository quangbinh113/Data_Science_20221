Song Name: Something In The Air Between Us
Sand and stars
The secret life of planet mars
Somewhere I can feel the sun
There's something in the air between us
Let it rain
Nothing ever stays the same
Your tears are falling in my dreams
There's something in the air between us
I've been soaring like a cloud
I call your name out loud
In taxis and in towns
And I have walked upon the beach
A rainbow within reach
The borderlines of love are gone
Drive me home
The night is burning gypsy red
I hear your voice inside my head
Oh, there's something in the air between us
In my room
The algebra of loving you
Is measured out in coffee spoons
There's something in the air between us
And when the night plays your guitar
I want to be with you
No matter where you are
And as the cars and lights go by
I'll shine there in your eyes
Until the moon and stars collide
And when the night plays your guitar
I want to be with you
No matter where you are
And as the cars and lights go by
I'll shine there in your eyes
Until the moon and stars collide
Something in the air between us
Something in the air
Between us
Something in the air 
Between us
