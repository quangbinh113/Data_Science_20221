Song Name: Vow - Alternate Version
Day by day
You belong to me
You've been lovely all the time
You got me right here through my heart
Baby, stay the same
Don't you feel the same?
You've been curing all of my pain
Soon, I will get your parent's blessing
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be mine
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be my bride
Your lovely eyes
Where the golden stars
Are shining bright with all the joy
I got you right there through your eyes
Stay the same
Don't you feel the same?
You've been curing all of my pain
Soon, I will get your parent's blessing
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be mine
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be my bride
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be mine
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
You say that I am the one, let me take you be my bride
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
Are you gonna love me for the rest of your life?
