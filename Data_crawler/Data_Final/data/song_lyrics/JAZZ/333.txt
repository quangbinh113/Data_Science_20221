Youngman, Let's get high
Shawty (high)
Youngman, Let's get high
Girl I love it when we high
Do it turn you on, shawty? Tell me if I'm wrong
I can see it in your eyes when you're high
That you feelin' my vibes, baby, you ain't gotta lie
I been waitin' all day to get high
With you shawty, you know you my boo
I got all this weed for you, girl, let's get high
Tonight, shawty, let's get high, shawty
I just got your text, that said, "Where you at?" (High)
You had a long day, need some weed for the stress
'Bout to wash up and get dressed (High)
Send me your address
And I'll be on my way, let's fuck and roll up some haze
I pull up to your place, see that smile on your face
Show me just how much you miss me, come take off all this BAPE (Yeah)
Girl, you know you wanna get high
With me, shawty I got what you need, me, backwoods and hella weed
I can't wait to get high
With you, girl, with you, girl, you should know, you should know
I can put you on another high
So let's ride, shawty, let's get high, shawty
'Girl, I love it when we high
Do it turn you on, shawty? Tell me if I'm wrong
I can see it in your eyes when you're high
That you feelin' my vibes, baby, you ain't gotta lie
I been waitin' all day to get high
With you shawty, you know you my boo
I got all this weed for you, girl, let's get high
Tonight, shawty, let's get high, let's get high
'Cos, I love it when we high
You know you love it that's why i fuck with you
Hate it when they try to blow our high
But we pay that no mind I'm so glad you're mine
And every time we get high
