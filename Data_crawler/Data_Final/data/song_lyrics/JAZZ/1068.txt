Song Name: Girl From Rio
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models
Tan lines, big curves, and the energy glows
You'll be falling in love with the girl from Rio (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let me tell you 'bout a different Rio (yeah)
The one I'm from, but not the one that you know
The one you meet when you don't have no Real
Baby, it's my love affair, it's my love affair, yeah
Just found out I have another brother
Same daddy, but a different mother
This was something that I always wanted
Baby, it's a love affair, it's a love affair, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-woah
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, it runs in my blood, oh
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, you already know, oh
A dime, a dozen, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I know, oh
It's my love affair, yeah (hit it, whip, fade)
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models
Tan lines, big curves, and the energy glows
You'll be falling in love with the girl from Rio
Vai malandra, gringo canta, todo mundo canta
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models
Tan lines, big curves, and the energy glows
You'll be falling in love with the girl from Rio
Vai malandra, gringo canta, todo mundo canta
Honório Gurgel forever (sou eu)
Babies having babies like it doesn't matter (ah, é)
Yeah, the streets have raised me, I'm favela (demais)
Baby, it's my love affair, it's my love affair, yeah
I just had to leave another lover (mais um?)
Guess he couldn't handle my persona (não fala!)
'Cause I'm cold like winter, hot like summer (yeah)
Baby, it's my love affair, it's my love affair, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh-woah
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, it runs in my blood, oh
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, you already know, oh
A dime, a dozen, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I know, oh (woo)
It's my love affair, yeah (um, dois, três, vai!)
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models

Vai malandra, gringo canta, todo mundo canta
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models
Tan lines, big curves, and the energy glows
You'll be falling in love with the girl from Rio
Vai malandra, gringo canta, todo mundo canta
