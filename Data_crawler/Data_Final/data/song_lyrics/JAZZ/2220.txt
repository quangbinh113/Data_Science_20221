Song Name: She Was Too Good to Me
She was too good to me
How can I get along now.
So close she stood to me
Everything seems so wrong now.
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile
That was her fun.
When I was mean to her
She never said go away now.
I was a king to her
Who's gonna make me gay now?
It's only natural
I'm so blue.
She was too good to be true.
