Song Name: Pieces Of Mind
You should have heard what he would say
It's hard to think he would have called
That it made a grain of sense at all
He fell in love and so did she
Could anybody stand to pray
Yet he expected her there
Recognize what's staring at you
You can get it either way
You can come along till you bury yesterday
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
Pieces of your mind
It's alarming what delusion brings
The focus goes you lose your thread
Leaving trouble ahead
Recognize what's staring at you
What is staring at you
You can get it either way
You can come along till you bury yesterday
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
The pieces of your mind
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
The pieces of your mind
A matter of time
A matter of time
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
Till we come together again
Till we come together
Pieces fo your mind
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
Till we come together again
Till we come together
It could only be a matter of time
Picking up the pieces of mind
Till we come together again
Till we come together
The pieces fo your mind
Picking up the pieces
It could only be a matter of time
Till we come together again
Picking up the pieces
Pieces of mind
