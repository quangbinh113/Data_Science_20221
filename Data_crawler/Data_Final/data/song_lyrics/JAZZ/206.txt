Song Name: Beautiful (feat. Camila Cabello)
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that Gucci look on you, amazin'
But nothin' can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're sayin' you're the one for me, I need to face it
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
Oh, my God, where did the time go?
I wish the hours would go slow, how is it 6 a.m.?
Your touch is heaven-sent
Beautiful, beautiful sight right now
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Got the angels singin' ooh-ah, right now like (ooh-ah)
And this is why we got to touch (ah)
Sometimes words are not enough (no)
Painted in your golden kiss
Honey dripping from your lips
I thank God and my lucky stars
Darling, don't you know what you are?
Yeah, baby, you are
Hey (hey, baby)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel (ooh)
Love your imperfections, every angle (oh, no, yeah)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know (you know)
So I just had to let you know
The way that Gucci look on you, amazin'
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know (ah-ah, yeah)
I just had to let you know
Swear to God, you're beautiful, yeah
