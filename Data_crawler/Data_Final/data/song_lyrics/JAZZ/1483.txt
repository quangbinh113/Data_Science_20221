Song Name: Motownphilly
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The East Coast family
Never skipped a beat (nah)
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
Then we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
(Boyz, Boyz)
Yo, these four new jacks is real
Smooth on the harmony tip
Nate, Mike, Shawn, and Wan
You know the mentality
Keep flippin' the gift
The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Philly town
Rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we were
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing, they came up to me I said
"Well what's your name?" (Boys II Men)
"Hey, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
Than I said, "Alright fellas
Well let me see what you can do"
And then the smart one named Wan, he said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz, Boyz, Boyz, Boyz, Boyz II Men
ABC, BBD
