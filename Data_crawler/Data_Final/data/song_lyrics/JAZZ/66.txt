Song Name: They Just Exist
Well there's blue
In the sky everyday
But all they wanna see
Is the gray
And I see beauty in the facets
Of every life
But until a life is gone
They don't have time
What they won't see
Is all the artistry
In love and hope and grief
In God, in death, in memories
But what I see
Is life as one big tapestry
With vibrance, holes in time
And a million threads
That intertwine
There's just something
About the way that this life is
Where pain and joy and love
And loss perfectly fit
There's just something
About the way that this life is
But for most of it
They just exist
When we fall
We've got skinny and bruised hearts
But most will only focus
On the scars
But I hope in time
They recognize
There is a choice
To find deep within those scars
Beautiful light
What they won't see
Is all the artistry
In love and hope and grief
In God, in death, in memories
But what I see
Is life as one big tapestry
With vibrance, holes in time
And a million threads
That intertwine
There's just something
About the way that this life is
Where pain and joy and love
And loss perfectly fit, oh
There's just something
About the way that this life is
But for most of it
They just exist
