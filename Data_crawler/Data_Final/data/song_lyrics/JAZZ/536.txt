Song Name: Turn Back The Clock
Another day is ended
And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days
When life was so much better
Oh, no
Lying here in silence
Picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
How I realise
They were the best years of my life
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days
When life was so much better
You might say it's just a case of giving up, no
But without these memories
Where is the love?
So where is the love?
If I could have it over
Live my life again, ohhh
I wouldn't change a single day
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days
When life was so much better
Why can't I turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days oh, no, no
I remember when
Life was so good
I'd go back if I could
Oh, oh I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away
I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away, hey
