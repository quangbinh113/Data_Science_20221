Song Name: Best Friend
It's come to my attention
That I don't show enough
Of what I think
It's only when I drink, I open up
But I promise that I love you
Even with that hairdo
I'm sorry I made fun of it
It's not your fault it looks like shit (like shit)
I have never tolerated someone for so long
I've never laughed so much
I haven't written a sad song
There's no one else I'd rather fall asleep with
And dream with
You're my best friend in the world
When we're ninety-eight and ninety-nine (ninety-nine)
Tumbling down the stairs
You'll barely catch me in time (tumbling down)
We'll argue about what to watch on TV
Finally pick a movie, then we'll fall asleep (asleep)
We'll still be a little bit strange
Some things never change
It's funny 'cause you drive me half insane
A universe without you would be thoroughly mundane
There's no one else I'd rather fall in love with
And that is my best friend in the world
You're my best friend in the world
