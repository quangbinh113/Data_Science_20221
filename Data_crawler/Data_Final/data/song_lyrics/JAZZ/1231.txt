Song Name: My Head (Canâ€™t Get You Out)
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
Every night and every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you lay?
Won't you lay?
Stay forever and ever and ever
La-la-la

Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
La-la-la

Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
