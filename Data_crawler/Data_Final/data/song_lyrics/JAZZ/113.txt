Song Name: Shouldn't Be
I can't stop feeling like none of this matters at
Fool around, tell me words
That you don't mean
I'm already numb to it
I'm already numb to it
Feed me lies, tear me up, break me down
I don't wanna be playin' these games
I'm already used to that
I'm already used to you being this cold
But keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real
I know we've been over this, it's nothing new
You're still gonna be leaving me here
It's easier hating you than missing you
But I don't wanna be feelin' this way
I'm already through with it
I'm already tired of thinking at all
'Cause keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real

And making you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?
No matter what I say to you
You're gone
I've been tryin' in vain to hold on
No matter what I say
Keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you've missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real
And making you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?
