Song Name: A Child Is Born
Now, out of the night
Soft as the dawn, into the light
This child, innocent child
Soft as a fawn, this child is born
One small heart, one pair of eyes
One work of art, here in my arms
Here he lies, trusting and warm
Blessed this morn, a child is born
One small heart, one pair of eyes
One work of art, here in my arms
Here he lies, trusting and warm
Blessed this morn, a child is born
