Song Name: I Can't Give You Anything But Love
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the one thing I've got plenty of, baby
Dreaming awhile, scheming a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you always pine for
Gee it's nice to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets woolworth's doesn't sell, baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well, well baby
I can't give you anything but love
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the one thing I've got plenty of, baby
Dreaming awhile, scheming a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you always pine for
Gee it's nice to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets woolworth's doesn't sell, baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well, well baby
I can't give you anything, I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love
