Song Name: Ooh Ahh (My Life Be Like) [feat. Tobymac]
My life be like
Ooh-ahh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
My life be like (Yeah)
Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
Ooh ahh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
My life be like (Yeah)
Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
My life be like (Yeah)
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low-key and stayin' candid
Reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Church for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fontaine
Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's high octane
Explosive how I came
Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hastle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind
Thin is the air I breathe
Teary-eyed nose runnin', wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me my behavior, had me lost at light speed
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
The fear of never fallin' in love
And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like)
Bad characteristics covered in Christs blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up
The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up
The highs and lows
Paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze
Tryin' to ease my woes
In this world of sin
Clothes to thin to fend
So to God I send
Words of help to win
In grumblings so deep, letters could never express
So the sounds of "Ooh ahh" beneath my breath projects
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
(Don't be bad)
My life be like
Ooh ahh ooh
Dum dum ditty
Here come that boy from the Capital City
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars or the truth will do (Uh)
I believe there's a private stunnin'
And I believe in the Kindgom coming
I believe if you seek the truth
You don't need to look far 'cause it's gonna find you
So why oh why do I trip and stumble?
And ooh ahh as commitment crumbles?
I can't believe that I'm here again...
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do (My life be like)
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Ma-ma-my life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
