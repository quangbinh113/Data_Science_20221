Song Name: Fallin'
I keep on fallin' in
And out of love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
Oh, oh, I
Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
Oh, baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin' (Yeah, yeah)
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall (Sing)
Fall
I keep on fallin' in and out (Out)
Of love (Love), with you (With you)
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
I'm fallin' in and out
Of love (Of love), with you (With you)
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
I'm fallin' in and out
Of love (Of love), with you (With you)
I never (No), loved someone (No, no)
The way that I love you
What?
