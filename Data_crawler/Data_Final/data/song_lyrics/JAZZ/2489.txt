Song Name: I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me
Yesterday you came my way
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill, you see.
That it was love at sight
And I was right to love you as I do,
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.
Your eyes of blue
Your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do,
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
You're telling everyone I know,
I'm on your mind each place you go,
They can't believe that you're in love with me.
I have always placed you far above me,
I just can't imagine that you love me;
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one,
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
Skies are gray,
I'm blue each day when you are not around,
Ev'rything goes wrong, my dear, I've found,
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you,
It all seems too good to me to all be true.
Your eyes of blue
Your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do,
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
You're telling everyone I know,
I'm on your mind each place you go,
They can't believe that you're in love with me.
I have always placed you far above me,
I just can't imagine that you love me;
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one,
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
