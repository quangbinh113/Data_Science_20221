Song Name: Beach Break
Do you wanna move my way?
'Cause I move, I dance
I'll show you how to dance with me
I'll dance, I'll show you how to dance, hey, hey
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way
See you lookin' over my way
Oh, I pretend as if it was the first
What's the problem, did I effect you?
We saw this comin'
But will you stay?
'Cause I move, I'll dance
I'll show you how to dance with me
I'll dance, I'll show you how to dance
Hey, hey
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way

You wanna dance but we're swimmin' on the water
Pretty girl in the red dress
Never thought this could be such a mess
I'll move, I'll dance
I'll show you how to dance with me
I dance, I'll show you how to dance, baby
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way
Show you how to move the way
My way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
Ah, yeah, my way, ah
I move, I dance, I'll show you how dance, baby
I dance, I'll show you how to dance, baby
