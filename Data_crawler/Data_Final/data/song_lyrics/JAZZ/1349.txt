Song Name: Ur Baby (feat. Khalid)
I don't know why you gotta be like you don't want it, yeah
You know that I can give you what you want, yeah
So put your name in it, I wanna scream it out
Just come and get it, I know what you want
Right here with me (yeah)
Yeah, I'm feeling what you're sayin' (sayin')
Thought in your body language
I'm swerving to your lanes
Okay, 'cause you like danger
I see it all in your eyes
Something I know you just can't hide
I got what you need for the night, right here with me
If I could be your baby
If you could be my baby
If I could be your baby
Only you can make me
If I could be your baby
If you could be my baby
If I could be your baby
Only you can make me, yeah
Be the boss
Show me how you do your job
Pay that cost
Show mе how you work for yours
I'll be here
Nеver said I'm going nowhere
Ah-oh, right here with me (yeah)
Know you for a minute and I'm holding you down
You know how it is every time I come around
Ain't nobody seein' what I see in ya
If I'm speedin' while I'm in it, gotta keep it up
When I'm pullin' up, you gotta leave your phone on silent
I like what we doin' when we do it in private
I just wanna be the one you wanna confide in, yeah
You're my baby
If I could be your baby
If you could be my baby
If I could be your baby
Only you can make me
If I could be your baby
If you could be my baby (baby)
If I could be your baby
Only you can make me, yeah
(Yeah-yeah, mm)
