Song Name: Endless Love
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
(Your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And I
I'd play the fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(No you know I don't mind)
Cause you
You mean the world to me
I know I've found in you
My endless love... endless love
And I
I'll be a fool
For you, I'm sure
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)
And, yes
You'd be the only one
'Cause no, I can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
My endless love
