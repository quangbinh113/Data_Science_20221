Song Name: (There Is) No Greater Love
There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song
No heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me
You're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone
There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you
