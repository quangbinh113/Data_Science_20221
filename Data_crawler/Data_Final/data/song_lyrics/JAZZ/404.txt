Song Name: Better
Ten minutes in I'm knees deep
Remind myself that I got to breathe
Been talking for hours now
Can't get you off my mind
Could stay for days, just you and me
I want to stay all night
Talk the things we like
Catching fireflies with you
Give you all my time
Just to make you mine
There's a reason why you make me
You make me, you make me better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
You make me so much
Two hours in you're all I see
Dreaming of everything we could be
Let's talk for days and nights
I don't want to let you out of sight
Let's stay for years, just you and me
I want to stay all night
Talk the things we like
Catching fireflies with you
Give you all my time
Just to make you mine
There's a reason why you make me
You make me, you make me better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better, better, better
You make me so much better, better, better
I want to stay all night
Talk the things we like
Catching fireflies with you
Give you all my time
Just to make you mine
There's a reason why you make me
You make me, you make me better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
You make me so much better
I want to stay all night
Talk the things we like
Catching fireflies with you
Give you all my time
Just to make you mine
There's a reason why
You make me better
