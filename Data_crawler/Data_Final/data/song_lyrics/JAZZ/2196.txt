Song Name: Wallflower Waltz
Propped up against the gymnasium wall
Leaning with surface lament
Not one whispered word
Nor crack of a smile
Emotions as solid cement
There's no need to sympathize
For kind and sure are those eyes
Are you getting scared my dear
Are you getting scared
To shyly compliment the mirror
To balance the compared
Then falls one solitary tear
Oh, to be the stared
And stumble with the inflicted faults
While stepping the wallflowerr waltz
Held and pushed by unleashed desires
Tethered in self-sacrifice
Reluctantly charmed by being approached
But guarded by one's own device
There's no need to criticize
For kind and sure are those eyes
