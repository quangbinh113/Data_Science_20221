Song Name: Want It Back
It's Patrice and Guts and Studio School Voice NYC
Hip Hop after all
Yeah, free town's alone land of diamonds
Real swagamuffin
Yeah, Africa, Europe, Afropean music
Boom
Oh, oh, it's now or never
Could wait for ever, ever
Oh, oh, it's now or never
Want it back, want it back
Our world we want it back
When it's rough, and it's tough
We won't be giving up
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
Same old news on the television
Switch it off, I cannot watch this with my son
Call me a dreamer, I'm not the only one
It only seems impossible until it's done
History is good until we tell another one
We will sell another gun and blame them
If they use it up to kill another one
Well it's still be for the storm
We set sail against the colors and the norms
Here we are
Oh, oh, it's now or never
Could wait for ever, ever
Oh, oh, it's now or never
Want it back, want it back
Our world we want it back
When it's rough, and it's tough
We won't be giving up
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
Why be less when you can be more
You did your best yet here we are
Came many miles, blazing my trail
Come off the waves
Why be less when you can be more
Tried your best still here we are
Came many miles, blazing our trail
Oh, come off the waves
Want it back, want it back
Our world we want it back
When it's rough, and it's tough
We won't be giving up
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
I'm a queen, I'm a king
And I want everything
