Song Name: Pepeta
Noriana, Rayvanny!
Oh pepeta, oh pepeta
Oh pepeta, oh pepeta
Oh pepeta
Bad girl you can be my baby mama
I wanna take you place we can chill for the summer
Your body language Tropicana
Private jet we can fly to Bahamas
Flat tummy chains on your waist (hayaa)
You better than my ex
I got the room party you can be my guest (hayaa)
I wanna feel that taste
(Sakata) Know you like it when I whine it
(Sakata) You wanna pull up right behind it
(Sakata) Feel the wave come and ride it
(Sakata) But don't get to close
(Sakata) I'm killer baby no lie
(Sakata) You know I can change your whole life
(Sakata) Keep it burn it like a wildfire
(Sakata) But don't get too close
I can tell you want love
Say you only want a top gyal
Ain't no body whine like me
But my love ain't free
Been there, hit it, hit it
Don't stop, bring it, bring it
Body on lock, feel it, feel it
Hips tik tok, get it, get it
Queen that's me
No time for them basic bs
Yeah, that gin got me lit
I put my hands on my hips
When I'm done, you are gonna miss me yeah
What u want, baby I'll be your
Number one, nothing can beat me
I'm in charge, listen to me yeah, me yeah
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta
Sakata, oh pepeta
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta
Know you like it when I whine it
(Sakata) You wanna pull up right behind it
(Sakata) Feel the wave come and ride it
(Sakata) But don't get to close
(Sakata) I'm killer baby no lie
(Sakata) You know I can change your whole life
(Sakata) Keep it burn it like a wildfire
(Sakata) But don't get too close
Kama tunda, naitaka
Ntailamba hiyo, ntainga'ata
Kama rhumba, nasakata
Namutoto hiyo napata
Cuz I got what you want and
You know its hot just like fire
If the heat in this room is not from me and you
Take me higher
Cuz baby don't you know
I got that rapa pum, pum, pum, pum
Pick it up now from the floor
Let me show you what I can do
Cuz baby don't you know
I got that rapa pum, pum, pum, pum
Pick it down, pick it up for me
I got that rapa pum, pum, pum, pum
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta
Pepeta, oh pepeta
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta
Oh pepeta
