Song Name: Look Me in My Eyes
Look me in my eyes
When you say that I'm about you
(I'm about you, I'm about you)
Look me in my soul when you're saying
That I doubt you
(I don't doubt you, I don't doubt you)
Keep it on the low
Just so I know I surround
(I surround you)
And if I gotta lie
Just to keep myself around you
(Yeah around you, yeah around you)
Look me in my eyes
When you say that I'm about you
Look me in my soul
When you saying that I doubt you
Keep it on the low
Just so I know I surround
And if I gotta lie
Just to keep myself around you
Shawty get the bag and throws it up
I was feeling all alone
I guess it's time to pour it up
What you want
Is in your vision
You just got grow it up
Real niggas in my city
Ain't too many more of us
They say
Life is just a moment
I won't ever call my bluff
Shawty you're the only reason
That I need to sober up
I keep fighting all my demons
See 'em screaming in the club
Alcohol goes through my liver
Money raining from above
Guess it's time to call it off
You said it
And I meant it
I don't regret it
I only learned a lesson
Look me in my eyes
When you say that I'm about you
Look me in my soul
When you saying that I doubt you
Keep it on the low
Just so I know I surround
And if I gotta lie
Just to keep myself around you
