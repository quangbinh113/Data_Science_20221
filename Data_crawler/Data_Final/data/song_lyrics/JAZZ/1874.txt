Song Name: Mrs. Cold
Hey baby, Mrs. Cold
Acting so tough, didn't know you had it in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long
You should have hurt me before I put my raincoat on
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You have found it because
You knew you'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby, what's going on?
You lost control and you lost your tongue
You lost me, deafened my ear
Nothing you can say is gonna change the way I feel
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You have found it because
You knew you'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
I stepped too close to your boundaries
You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby, what is love? It was just a game
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
