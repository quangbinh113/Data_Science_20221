Song Name: Rest Assured
Used to hold my secrets in when we first began
Pouring out my heart just wasn't part of the plan
But I know
This love is for sure
And now I can open up without feeling insecure
Yeah
Never knew that we could become more than just friends
I was out of luck but you still gave me a chance
I won't go
'Cause with you I'm home
When the flowers are blooming girl you just can't ignore
Suddenly I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont ever leave you rest assured
'Cause I, I know that forever's not enough
But I'll be your side when time's get rough
My heart is all yours to keep
I'm yours for the taking
'Cause you're all I've been waiting for
Rest assured
Used to get all nervous
When I first held your hand
Little did I know
You'd turn me to a better man
Mi amor
It's you I adore
And all of this time
I spent with you got me wanting more
Yeah
Can't believe I used to walk around and pretend
Til' you came around and let me be who I am
There's no way
That I wouldn't stay
And girl you should know that I still feel the same
Suddenly I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont ever leave you rest assured
'Cause I, I know that forever's not enough
But I'll be your side when time's get rough
My heart is all yours to keep
I'm yours for the taking
'Cause you're all I've been waiting for
Rest assured
