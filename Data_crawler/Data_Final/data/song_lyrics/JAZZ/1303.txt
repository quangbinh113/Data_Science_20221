Song Name: Fire In My Head
Girl, I don't want nobody else
You say I'm looking like a Rothko
And I want you too
Saint Laurent smells good on you
So girl, I don't want nobody else
And I feel cold now lately
Cold now, baby
There's no fire left in my head
And I feel cold now lately
Cold now, baby
There's no fire left in my head
You say that you are movin' on
My face distorted and oblong now
And I feel cold now lately
Cold now, baby
There's no fire left in my head
And I feel cold now lately
Cold now, baby
There's no fire left in my head
And I feel cold now lately
Cold now, baby
There's no fire left in my head
