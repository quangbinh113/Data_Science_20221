Song Name: Moon River - Remastered/2006
Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's ends
Waiting 'round the bend, my Huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
Me and my Huckleberry friend
Me and my Huckleberry friend
Waiting, waiting
Me and my Huckleberry friend
