Song Name: Suicidal
You wanna talk funky?
And this bed's too big for me without you
I doubt you'll ever feel the same
I got a massive hole inside my heart
Girl, it screams your stupid fuckin' name
And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'll even scream for help
No way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrist
It might help
How was it enough to put Louis V flashlights
Dyin' on them bitches like a Louis print flashlight
I was in my bag I was tryna get my cash right
Always wanna spazz out I don't like to act right
And I'm feelin' suicidal
I don't pray to God I ain't never read the Bible
Fuck that
If you catch me on the bad day
Down back, get the fuck out of my way
And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'll even scream for help
No way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrist
It might help
I don't even know how to take these drugs
I ain't suicidal flexin' on my idols
I was tellin' 'em all to walk a mile in my shoes
But you can't just afford them (yeah)
I did hell drugs 'cause we bought 'em ('cause we bought 'em)
She bought Balenciaga (yeah)
She don't got a father (eh)
Hennessey on tip like it's water like it's aqua
And I'm always suicidal for the shit I'm getting commonest
Raised by streets only made 'cause of my mama
And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'll even scream for help
No way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrist
It might help
