Song Name: Love Scars 4
Don't give up on me
You know that I love you, baby (baby)
You know that I trust you, baby (baby)
Nobody else's, oh
Know that I love you, baby
Know that I trust you, baby
Girl, you barely know (barely know)
How I really felt (really felt) about you, woah
And don't think I'd forget, I said I love
I said I love you, girl
And, baby, you're stuck
Transmission went out
Transitions, my house
New positions to try out
Let's go, babe, right now
Let's go, babe, right now
Baby, let's go
I know, I know, I know, I know that you're still in love (yeah)
I know, I know, I know, I know that you're still in love (do it again)
I know, I know, I know, I know that you're still in love (yeah)
I know, I know, I know, I know that you're still in love (love)
You're in love
You're in love
Don't give up on me
You know that I love you, baby (baby)
You know that I trust you, baby (baby)
Nobody else's, oh
Know that I love you, baby
Know that I trust you, baby

Girl, you barely know (barely know)
How I really felt (really felt) about you, woah
And don't think I'd forget, I said I love
I said I love you, girl
