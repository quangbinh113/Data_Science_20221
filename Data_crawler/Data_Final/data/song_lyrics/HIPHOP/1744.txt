Song Name: Look At You
Okay I'm in effect
I hit the liquor but it hasn't hit my system yet
Okay lets hit the deck, sorry I missed your text
He want a picture in the shower of my biddies wet
Is that a litmus test
I'm not your Santa, baby
You gon' need to simp
Before I start reciprocating
Why your girl wan' talk to me
When I'm not engaging
You don't cuddle me enough
To do your litigating
He want me to put out
He should go to cd baby
Lil baby, he harder than ever
Thats my oopsie daisy
Blue your babies
You can't outdo your 2k rating
Not tryna show off, honey, who's parading
Look at me look at you then look back at me
Thats embarrassing
You see how my ass sit in these baggy jeans
Don't make me send you back to therapy
Okay I'm outtie, don't get me started
Hitting me at 2 am like I know you want me
Right, I beg your pardon, I'm not your Dolly
Tryna get your balls between my legs like you Obi Toppin
Knock it off, Sway
You my Phonte
You gon' have to put me up like a lock tray
Thick lips, thick ass cuz I'm god's fav
All I needs a lipgloss and some Moncler
It goes if I say, I'm sorry
Won't ride it like a jockey
Your girl shining
Here comes Johnny
You cant handle doggy, baby please quit asking
Make me take a Aspirin, that is so attractive
Look at me, look at you, then look back at me
Acting like I owe you some, who gave you the audacity
He think he a keeper but I'm only playing catch release
Show you where the clit is, boy, I don't have the capacity
You need a map, ay
Honest to god, get off my back
We not attached, ay
I'm writing it off, off of my tax
We never smashed, k
Sign on the dot, calling me bae
What am I Mac Dre? I don't get got
Put you into place
You on a poster
You want a side piece
Go get a holster
You wanna talk
You wanted closure
Ugh as if
Have I ever hit you when I'm sober
Look at me look at you then look back at me
Thats embarrassing
You see how my ass sit in these baggy jeans
Don't make me send you back to therapy
