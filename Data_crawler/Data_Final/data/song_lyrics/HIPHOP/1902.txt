Song Name: Locked Up
I'm steady tryna find a motive (motive)
Why I do what I do
The freedom ain't gettin' no closer (closer)
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen (stolen)
No registration ('tration)
Cops patrolin' (patrolin')
And now they done stop me and I get locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no, they won't let me out
Headin' uptown to re-up (re-up)
Back with a couple keys (keys)
Corner blocks on fire (fire)
Under covers dressed as fiends (fiends)
Makin' so much money (money)
Products moving fast (fast)
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag, fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(My nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
(I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(Baby girl, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no, they won't let me out
'Cause visitation no longer comes by (comes by)
Seems like they forgot about me (about me)
Commissary is getting empty (empty)
My cellmates getting food without me (without me)
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
(Move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(Oh, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no, they won't let me out
(My nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out (oh, oh, oh)
(They won't let me out) baby, I'm locked up
They won't let me out, no, they won't let me out
Can you pay me a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Pay a visit, baby (no, they won't let me out)
'Cause I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
Where's my lawyer? (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Get me out of here (oh, they won't let me out)
I'm locked up
(They won't let me out, they won't let me out)
Baby, I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
Where's my niggas on the block? (No, they won't let me out)
Tell them I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
Oh (they won't let me out)
Can you please accept my phone calls? (They won't let me out)
'Cause I'm locked up, locked up, locked up
