Song Name: Fair Trade (with Travis Scott)
I don't understand why you blame me
Take me as I am, it's the same me
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy
Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosy
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'
I'm outside, 29, G5, seaside
I been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that, it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Momma used to be on disability but gave this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin', I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I still see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep on us anymore, it's with security
I'm outside (yeah), 29 (yeah), G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
I don't understand why you blame me
Take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm trying)
Senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see (Outside)
Rollin' in a Rolls and ain't no saftey
Ridin', engine revvin'
Gotta roll over to you gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown as I'm going out to eat
You can hear the raw sounds when it rock up in your sleep
I'ma roll on her 'fore I let her roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in a harmony (sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (sick, sick)
It's just a worryin', I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (yeah)
Early morning, shoulder rubs and lawyer signed the settlement
I'm never settling this shit get darker then my melanin
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrolling through my call log by emojis how I'm saving 'em
Del Mar as the beach where my hoe was but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies dem
Backwood in your face, won't push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (break it)
They sent a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know they position, you know ass up with the face down (let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' an event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me it's just sense
I'm droppin' the top, no tint for the whip
I'm dropping the top 'cause bro tried to spin
She dropping the top she back again
Fuck her 'cause she at the crib again, company
I let it slide when I really should slid
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repaying me back
Now fall out my real
Tell me what kind of payment is that?
I put that on my kid and my trust
Yeah, it is what it is
I'm outside, 29, G5, (ah-ah-ah), seaside
I been losing friends and finding peace
But honestly that sounds like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one then I'm still here
Outside, front line, Southside
I been losing friends and finding peace
Honestly, that sounds like a fair trade to me
I don't understand why you blame me
Take me as I am, it's the same me
Senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see
Up on a mountain (up on a mountain)
Search through the valley (search through the valley)
You hear me calling (you hear me calling)
Won't you come find me? (Won't you come find me?)
Please don't forsake me (please don't forsake me)
All of a sudden (all of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (breaking)
I feel it coming, I, I
