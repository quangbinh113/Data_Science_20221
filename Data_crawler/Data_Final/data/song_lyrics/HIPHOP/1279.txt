Song Name: Fallin
(Menoh)
(Menoh!)
Brr-ah
Uh, uh (yeah)
Risin' (risin')
Yeah, you risin', yeah, you fallin'
Yeah, you polished, yeah, you flawless
Need your space, oh? Beg your pardon
I did the race, my love, I saw it
I found a weakness and I fought it
She got that cake, she in my comments
Said she got faith (faith)
Said she got faith and she pullin' up on me
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
Everything gon' get better my way
Every day, I be rockin' the latest
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
I can see in their face, they outdated
Not my fault that you should've updated
Oh, this old flow is ancient, I be on go mode, Liu Kang, Kang
I got that gas when I'm feelin' jaded, you ain't the man if you ain't most hated
They say, "Vercetti, you comin' like that?", I said, "Hold on, bro, I'm comin' right back"
I'm in that mode, I'ma call you right back, I don't go to sleep 'cause I'm on it like that
I'm in the kitchen, lil' ho, are you kiddin'? That vibe that you thinkin' I already did it
These Japanese denim, you can't even get it, this 33 waist, no, I can't even fit it
You try to cross me, then I tell 'em, "Good riddance", I'm tryna get guala, I fuck with good business
Forgot that they know us, but now the coupe tinted
Worried 'bout missin', I'm worried 'bout digits
Yeah, you risin', yeah, you fallin'
Yeah, you polished, yeah, you flawless
Need your space, oh? Beg your pardon
I did the race, my love, I saw it
I found a weakness and I fought it
She got that cake, she in my comments
Said she got faith (faith)
Said she got faith and she pullin' up on me
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
Everything gon' get better my way
Every day, I be rockin' the latest
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
I can see in their face, they outdated
Not my fault that you should've updated
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
Everything gon' get better my way
Every day, I be rockin' the latest
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (oh, my)
I can see in their face, they outdated
Not my fault that you should've updated
