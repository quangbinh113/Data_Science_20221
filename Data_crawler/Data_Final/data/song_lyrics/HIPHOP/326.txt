Song Name: Alone (feat. A Boogie Wit da Hoodie)
Uh
Yeah yeah
Uh
Taylor, Taylor
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
I just wanna be alone yeah
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
Ye, I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
Every other day another issue
Argue, fighting make me want to hit you
When it comes to that point I just can't be with you
Got me stressing fuckin up my mental
Sitting back thinking about all the shit we been through
Always treated you first never like a pencil
Used to love when I see you and hug and kiss you
Now I feel like a fight every time I'm with you
You did for me and I did for you
I ain't bragging that's what real niggas do
I ain't changed stayed a buck with you
Remember when I was in love with you
Remember when I used to fuck with you
Now the vibe is uncomfortable
Remember when I used to fuck with you
Feeling like the vibes are uncountable damn
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
I just wanna be alone yeah
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
Ye, I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
Came home bumping A boogie
We went half on a baby
Went half on a baby
Was there the whole pregnancy
Till you gave birth on the day of your labor
That day I was there
You gave me a son and forever and ever I'll always be thankful
Got me popping the pills for the pain I think I'm starting to go crazy
But forever I'll be stuck with you
Now I gotta throw up the deuce
Got me here singing about the blues
Nah girl I can't fuck with you
With the gang sipping 80 proof
Talking about what I'm going through
Really don't know what to do
Who to blame is it me and you?
Trust issues got you so confused
Wanna know who I'm talking to
Where I'm going and what I'm doing
I can't tell you girl I'm so confused
Damn
Told you over and over again
I still love you but please understand
I can't take it, girl this is the end
This is the end
I just wanna be alone
Yeah
Yeah
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
I just wanna be alone yeah
I just wanna be alone
You and me can't get along
Too much drama when I'm home
Rather be up on the road, yeah
Always blowin' up my phone
Always got me at my zone
Think it's time to move on
Ye, I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
I tell you over and over again
I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone yeah
I just wanna be alone yeah
I just wanna be alone yeah
