Song Name: Last Man Standing
Ayo
Uh-uh, uh-uh
No more revolutionaries, it's just fuck the opps, ignore the peace
Died in the hood, he never left with so much more to see
Heard the news 'bout him, really hurt me to my core for weeks
The other side and 12 huntin' while we explore the streets
Jealous of my melanin, will make you human more than me
They threatin' us, oppressin' us, we 'posed to play that cordially
Thinkin' 'bout that shit, like what if George is me?
Justice fucked up, it's them, sit back and watch them torture me
Like why you ain't gon' help me, just recordin' me?
Feel pressure, then I'm shootin', final seconds out the quarter, three
'Cause I be damned if I let a pig put a fork in me
The feds knockin', that just mean the devil at the door for me
I just hope the Lord with me
They tried to change the rules
But shit ain't goin' how they planned it
Guarantee you I'm gon' be the last man standing
Officer down, bodies droppin', them shells landin'
Chi-town leader' like Fred Hampton, uh
Them babies starvin', their parents can't even afford Pampers
No wonder why it's hustle or die, and clap hammers
He dropped out of school, he only speakin' that trap grammar
They teachin' us lies, them facts scatter
Don't want us with self love, missin' history, ain't got answers
So they ain't promotin' the black Jesus or black Santa
Know our day'll arise when we see through all of the propaganda
On that front line, fist balled like Black Panther
Starin' in the eyes of a nigga-hatin' cracker
Like why the fuck I gotta prove to you my black ass matters?
No, really, why the fuck we still marchin'?
Badge abusers still sparkin'
'Cause my skin color, I've seen real darkness
They tried to change the rules
But shit ain't goin' how they planned it
Guarantee you I'm gon' be the last man standing
Officer down, bodies droppin', them shells landin'
Chi-town leader' like Fred Hampton, uh
