Song Name: LOST IN THE CITADEL
Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy? Do your dreams still sink in down?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find your way to come back around
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
My God, you're an angel
I only seen you in your halo
I was hoping we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes
I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
Why I thought it was forever?
I only see you maybe never
Why I thought we'd be together
When you treat it like whatever?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my love is fallin' down
Playing the victim when all my envisionings
Come slowly tumbling down
Putting me back on the ground
I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy? Do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find your way to come back around
