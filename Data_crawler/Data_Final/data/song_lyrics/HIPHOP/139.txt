Song Name: Antidote
Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote (yeah)
Poppin' pills is all we know (ooh)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood)
Don't go through the front door (through the back)
It's lowkey at the night show (ooh)
So don't you open up that window (ooh)
Don't you let out that antidote, yeah
Party on a Sunday (that was fun)
Do it all again on Monday (one more time)
Spent the check on a weekend (oh my God)
I might do it all again (that's boss shit)
I just hit a three peat (ooh)
Fucked three hoes I met this week (Robert Horry)
I don't do no old hoes (oh, no, no)
My nigga, that's a no-no (straight up)
She just want the coco (cocaina)
I just want dinero (paper hunt)
Who that at the front door? (Who that is?)
If it's the feds, oh-no-no-no (don't let 'em in, shhh)
Don't you open up that window (yah)
Don't you let out that antidote (yah, ooh)
Poppin' pills is all we know (yah)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood)
Don't go through the front door (in the back)
It's lowkey at the night show (ooh)

Everything can happen at the night show (ooh)
Ooh, at the night show

Your bitch not at home, she at the night show, ooh (straight up)
Fuckin' right, hoe (ooh)
Had to catch a flight for the night show (ooh)
Let's get piped though
Bottles got us right though, we ain't sippin' light though (syke)

Stackin' up day to day
Young nigga, you know you gotta go get it, go get it, my nigga
They hatin', they stinkin', they waitin'
Don't be mistaken, we dyin', they stayin'
Lord, I'm on fire they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
'Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one and you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where
Poppin' pills is all we know (ooh)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood!)
Don't go through the front door (through the back)
It's lowkey at the night show (ooh)
So don't you open up that window (ooh)
Don't you let out that antidote
