Song Name: Petty Too (feat. Future)
(IRoccOnTheBeat)
(Who made this shit, Pharaoh?)
He got caught with a bitch I hit like twice, but I denied
I put my lil' bitch on him, he thinking with his dick, so he gon' slide
You can't call me petty, me, I share my bitches with the guys
I got bitches who I fuck and they got names, but I can't brag
I'm a heavy hitter, you wanna fly out your friend, you better be ready with her
Bitches cool, they never put me on blast 'cause I'm not petty with them
I did a show five hundred thou', ask Bands, I got my Patek bigger
Back to Miami, got her ass on fleek, she got her panties bigger
I just got a plug, he keep me flooded when that price low
I like trenches hoes who sell they lean card for they micros
I be in the trump, stuffing my Runtz up with my white hoes
Police pop out daytime, but we pop outside at night though
Petty ass
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you ready, then I'm ready too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, then I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you ready, then I'm ready too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it) (yeah, Pluto, woo)
Cutting off my partner, was thinkin' trappin' wasn't no hobby
Drop you off the label, you ain't ready to catch a body
Plugged up like cable, you gon' think I'm Black Mafia
Sub twins, soon as we catch up, nine dollar
Whack that nigga, have his family writing me a novel
Went to Louis Vuitton just to show off my Balenciagas
Get mop from a prostitute, I feel her teeth, she ain't gettin' a dollar
My young ho 22, she don't keep it P, I'ma fuck her mama
She ain't just for the street, these hoes for the Earth
I knew she was a freak, she grew up in a church
These hoes poppin' Plan B's like they Percs
Said I was a deadbeat when I bought my daughter a Birkin
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, bitch, I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you ready, then I'm ready too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you petty, then I'm petty too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Bitch, you ready, then I'm ready too, uh, uh (bitch, let's get it)
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh
