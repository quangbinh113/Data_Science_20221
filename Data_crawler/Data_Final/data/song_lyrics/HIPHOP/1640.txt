Song Name: Summer Is Over
Living in a past life
Maybe it's the last time
Heavy on the inside
Looking for my star sign, oh
Everything is tie-dyed (ooh)
I don't wanna live a lie (ooh)
So how I'm supposed to feel alright?
How am I supposed to get up from the feeling?
I see crowds of millions there
All fucked up with their hands in the air
Ready just to party like the summer don't end, end
Maybe our love is a demon unchained
If it was the same, would you do it all again?
How long does the high last, you know? (know)
I need you like the sun, sun, sun, sunshine
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over)
I need you like the moon, moon, moon, moonlight
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over), oh-oh, yeah
Got me trapped, thinking nobody can save me
You're the person I gotta pay for, that's my baby
I've been thinking I was better on my own
Made decisions that would make you wanna hate me
I thought pressure was supposed to make us diamonds
Sunshine, crystal waters on these islands
How are we living? We're so toxic, I'm sick
Gotta pretend that It's nothing when
I see crowds of millions there
All fucked up with their hands in the air
Ready just to party like the summer don't end, end
Maybe our love is a demon unchained
If it was the same, would you do it all again?
How long does the high last, you know? (Know)
I need you like the sun, sun, sun, sunshine
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over)
I need you like the moon, moon, moon, moonlight
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over), oh-oh, yeah
What's the point of getting locked in here?
Was the point to get trapped in here?
On the road, I made a love song, yeah (Summer is over)
Why you wanna go somewhere? (Summer is over)
Now you had me feel lonely
And I'd rather be doing me
Now I've stuck around (summer is over), I know
(Summer is over)
I need you like the sun, sun, sun, sunshine
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over)
I need you like the moon, moon, moon, moonlight
Now summer is over (summer is over), summer is over (summer is over) oh-oh, yeah
