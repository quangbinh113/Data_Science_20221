Song Name: Die Right Now
I don't wanna die right now
I don't wanna die right now
Tell them people, "Pipe down"
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I don't even wanna die now
I might fuck her right now
She just said, "Goodbye" right now
Made me wanna die right now
I might fuck her right now
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I can't even cry right now, oh
I do this for the kids like me, bro I believe in you
Pain on top of pain inside you, but hurt and bleedin' too
Just go and chase your dreams when nobody gon' believe in you
You ain't gotta take your life 'cause you put here just for a reason to
You put here just for a reason to
And to be honest, lately I ain't even sleepin' too
It's so much shit up on my mind
I'm fightin' demons too, I needed you
Fightin' depression, I ain't been eatin' food
I had thoughts about this rap shit
Thoughts about the suicide, droppin' up in the casket
He don't wanna go but they caught him up in the traffic
But that's just how it go when you tryna just make it happen
I don't wanna die right now
I don't wanna die right now
Tell them people, "Pipe down"
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I don't even wanna die now
I might fuck her right now
She just said, "Goodbye" right now
Made me wanna die right now
I might fuck her right now
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I can't even cry right now, oh
I wish my bro could just see me blow
I wish he know how I far I made it, he don't fuckin' know
But when he out, I swear to God I'm finna split the dough
Get some more, life gon' crash, sometimes you lose control
And why the fuck we gotta die?
I got older and older and dropped a tear for all my guys
I got older and older and dropped a tear for every cry
I got older and older and dropped a tear for all my guys, yeah
I don't wanna die right now
I don't wanna die right now
Tell them people, "Pipe down"
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I don't even wanna die now
I might fuck her right now
She just said, "goodbye" right now
Made me wanna die right now
I might fuck her right now
Too much on my mind, it's right now
I can't even cry right now, oh
