Song Name: Fate (with Young Thug & Swae Lee)
Pretty baby, I won't lie
I can't get it right, one shot
Roll this up and let's skydive
I hope you are not afraid of heights
(Mike Will Mike will)
Cause I'm just a true
Rolling like a fool
What has I got myself into
Hurry up and choose
I'm in sky and i chill
With this ice in my ears
I want to look good out and live
We shared that apartment with sheets
I jump off a jet to a building
I take care of everybody billings
I wish they can stop with the killing
I thought you didn't need me, they need me
Ain't telling my business they winning, winning
Maintaining six hundred and six childrens
Somebody else die when you sit and chillin
In the prison your grandchildren
You can kicking it bright and early
And you ready the gat killin'
My heart and body wish she can heal it
