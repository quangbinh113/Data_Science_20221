Song Name: Before I Go (feat. Rod Wave)
Can't nobody take it away from me
I'm in these waters but I don't know how to swim
Got all these problems but I don't know how to deal with it
I miss my mama's face, I'm still a lil' kid
Everything my momma say I try to remember it
My youngin five, he say he dyin' to live
I don't know why but they be plotting to kill me
Can't let nobody take me away from my children
Can't let nobody take me away from these millions
Everybody gon' die before I go, go
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
Everybody gon' die before I leave
I know 'bout the art of war and I know how it got to be
Before you take me out the game I'ma make you foul me from the three
I'ma make you stand up in the paint, I'ma make it harder than you think
They be hatin' on a n-, it don't matter 'cause I'm heaven sent
They waitin' on a n- but I know it's out of jealousy
Shooters on the roof of my residence, just like the President's
And a shooter in the coupe, step on sh-, only keep tellin' me (yeah, yeah)
I'm in deep water, but I don't know how to swim
Got all these problems, I don't know how to deal with 'em
I miss my mama's face, I'm still a lil' kid
Everything my momma say I try to remember it
My youngin five, he say he dyin' to live
I don't know why but they be plotting to kill me
Can't let nobody take me away from my children
Can't let nobody take me away from these millions
Everybody gon' die before I go
Everybody gon' die before I go, oh
Everybody gon' die before I go, oh
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
I been going way too hard with the pills
Seems like that's the only way I can feel sometimes
If I could, I'd fill my cup up with tears
I know my haters would love to hear how a vulture cry
I be so high the day I go, I'ma be so f- fresh
I pray to God to take it slow, call my number next
I don't know why these n- hatin' and they want my flesh
All the real n- appreciate me and what I done for this
I'm in deep waters and I feel myself sinkin'
I never died, no more, I really told my baby
All of my pain be on display because I'm famous
These n- scared of me, so they gon' have to snake me
I'on't wanna die for love, can't let 'em get the best of me
I'm a big ol' stepper, I don't need no stepper 'cause I'ma step for me
Even though I'm a thug, I listen to mama, man, she lecture me
I keep the '5 when I lay down, 'cause I can't rest in peace
I'm in these waters but I don't know how to swim
Got all these problems but I don't know how to deal with it
I miss my mama's face, I'm still a lil' kid
Everything my momma say I try to remember it
My youngin five, he say he dyin' to live
I don't know why but they be plotting to kill me
Can't let nobody take me away from my children
Can't let nobody take me away from these millions
Everybody gon' die before I go, go
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
Everybody gon' die before I go, woah
