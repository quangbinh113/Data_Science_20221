Song Name: Thuggish Ruggish Bone
We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs (Thugs, thugs, thugs)
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
You're feelin' the strength of the rumps that bump
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' yo peoples, 'cause we so real
Chill, better bring yo weapon when steppin', bring on that ammunition
Trippin' on sip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine, so scream out "Mo!", and let me hear ya holla
Nut about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flamin' my dank and drinkin' brew
Thinkin' about hangin', countin' my bankin
Thuggin' trues, fools
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug, bustas
You know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straightjacket's, gotta make that money, mayne
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teachin'
You're "soldiers" (How thugstas must act)
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack wig blew all the way back
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in The Land
But creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain, rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And runnin' from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the Double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff, puff puff to the brain, shot
Left P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English? Really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone, so leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe that we runnin' this Thug Style
So what now?
See the Bone Thug claim thug, never gonna change, so flame up
Sit back and just smoke the same cut
Leathaface on ah creep, and I came up
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Gotta give it on up to the Glock, Glock
Pop pop, better drop when the buckshot blow
The Bone in me never no hoe, so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Little Mo Hart run up, nut up, and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip then
Me stickin' me bloody victim man, but they test nuts
To the chest and put 'em to rest, and but I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and gotta get through my soul, but it won't budge
Mugged, drug me victim, the blood on me runnin' my mental
The thug in me stuck in me, keepin' it simple, the bud in me me running me pen, so
To the temple, buck when you duck, to the Thuggish Ruggish T's
St. Clair P's, to field, to the G's, and a buck to all my enemies
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
We got Layzie and Krayzie
Bizzy's in the house
Wish is in the house
And Flesh
And Shatasha
Cleveland's definitely in the house
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
