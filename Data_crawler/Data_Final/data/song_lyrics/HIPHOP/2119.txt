Song Name: You Got Me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian Queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She's studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she love my show in Paris at Elyse Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart
Intense and shatter, she like, that shit don't matter
When I get home, get at her, pull out her phone
Whatever, let's lay, let's get together, shit, you think that not?
Think that dog went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is makin' her hot
Started building with her constantly 'round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop and keep telling me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some
Another lonely night?
It seems like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy, keep that shit tight
But yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Sike, I'm playin' boo, you know it's just with you I'm stayin' boo
And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you
Is you crazy? You my king, for real
But sometimes, relationships get ill, no doubt
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
That snake could be that chick and that rat
Could be that cool cat that's whisperin'
She's trying to play you for the fool, black
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every-five-minutes, it's all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's in tact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some oh, I'm a celebrity
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squaws and listenin' to they girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where the drama begins and she like yo
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
