Song Name: GNF (OKOKOK)
Uh
Shh
Wait, slow it down (baow)
Okay, okay, okay (don't give no fuck, Yo, Varohl)
If 12 comin', we gon' take 'em on the chase (I ain't give no fuck)
Just a cold heart and a banger on my waist (them Glocks gon' bust)
And they hoppin' out, nigga, that ain't no debate
And them killers gon' jump out the roof
If I give them the green, then them lil' niggas shoot, uh
And I really got rich out the blue
But I see red when I'm in the booth
His advance, I spent that on the coupe
Had to really take a stand with the troops
Uh, so, bitch, if you see me, salute
And we too turnt, nigga, we don't recruit
I seen his lil' diss, that was cute
My lil' sniper gon' blow like a flute
And shout out to Pop Smoke
But they don't really wanna fuck with Lil Woo
Be direct, boy, you talking to who?
I got shooters that don't even hoop
If it's that, ain't no callin' a truce
Why they mad? I'm just talkin' the truth, bitch
Wait, slow it down (baow)
Okay, okay, okay (don't give no fuck, Yo, Varohl)
If 12 comin', we gon' take 'em on the chase (I ain't give no fuck)
Just a cold heart and a banger on my waist (them Glocks gon' bust)
And they hoppin' out, nigga, that ain't no debate
If you diss on the 'net, get your scalp hit
You'd be better off watchin' your mouth, bitch
Real killers don't care 'bout no clout shit
They ain't drop, spin the block, reroute quick
Hut one, hut two, we steppin'
We be really tryna use these weapons
Squeezin' on that two plus seven
Hollows plus you, that's Heaven
Man, I really done turned to a maniac
In that storm, I was stuck where it's rainy at
If they owe me respect, gotta pay me that
So his mama gon' cry for her baby back
And if all of them die, I'm okay with that
'Cause the G-A-N-G, we don't play with that
Four-nickel, I packaged the Drac' with that
Walk up and make sure that his brains splat
Wait, slow it down (baow)
Okay, okay, okay (don't give no fuck, Yo, Varohl)
If 12 comin', we gon' take 'em on the chase (I ain't give no fuck)
Just a cold heart and a banger on my waist (them Glocks gon' bust)
And they hoppin' out, nigga, that ain't no debate
