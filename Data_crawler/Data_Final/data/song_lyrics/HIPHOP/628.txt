Song Name: Divorce (Intro)
Oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Shared a room with my mom until I'm fifteen
And I was livin' on my own when I turned sixteen
When your parents break up, you lose your siblings
But sometimes it ain't better if we fix things
Said the bruises on my body will always go away
But the words you said to me, they will always fuckin' stay
And yeah, I get presents upon my birthday
But that don't mean shit 'cause y'all still separate
Goin' home to home will make you really feel so crazy
It's love for all my siblings, know we rockin', shout out Haley
My brother sixteen, and he 'bout to have a baby
It's a beautiful struggle, I thank the man above daily
'Cause what you know about livin' out bags, goin'
House to house, and pack all the bags and I'm like...
Everybody say, "just chill and relax"
But then my heart went and shattered like they threw it on a glass, yeah
Shared a room with my mom until I'm fifteen
And I was livin' on my own when I turned sixteen
When your parents break up, you lose your siblings
But sometimes it ain't better if we fix things
Said the bruises on my body will always go away
But the words you said to me, they will always fuckin' stay
And yeah, I get presents upon my birthday
But that don't mean shit 'cause y'all still separate
I'm that kid that was kind, on the type I was on
Blame it on myself and yeah, my mind it went disabled, uh
Monday to Tuesday, I'm with my mom, that's the judge's choice
Wednesday to Thursday, I'm with my dad, said the judge's voice
Shared a room with my mom until I'm fifteen
And I was livin' on my own when I turned sixteen
When your parents break up, you lose your siblings
But sometimes it ain't better if we fix things
Said the bruises on my body will always go away
But the words you said to me, they will always fuckin' stay
And yeah, I get presents upon my birthday
But that don't mean shit 'cause y'all still separate
Oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh
