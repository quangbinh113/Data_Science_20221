Song Name: Mind Yo Business (Feat. Latto)
Hitmaka
First off, bitch, mind yo' business (business)
Bad bitch, everyday like Christmas
Attitude on, "Fuck you, pay me"
It take more than a Bentley to date me
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him (nah)
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him
Ooh, I love when they chase me (I love when they chase me)
Good luck if you tryna replace me (nah)
220 on the dash like Stacy (ayy)
And yeah, that nigga fine, but he move too janky (movе too janky)
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got morе than me, I can't fuck him (bitch I can't fuck him)
If he ain't got what I need, I duck him (I duck him)
Pussy gon' pop like a pea, I bust him (pussy pop, pop)
Bad bitch gon' shop, no gimmicks (no gimmicks)
Brand new drop top, not rented (not rented)
And every time a bitch start, I finish (I finish)
If it ain't money in the text, don't send it (nigga don't send it)
First off, bitch, mind yo' business (bitch mind yo' business)
Bad bitch, everyday like Christmas (bitch I'm bad)
Attitude on, "Fuck you, pay me" (yeah)
It take more than a Bentley to date me
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him (nah)
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him) Latto
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him (ayy)
Nigga, please, got me fucked up (fucked up)

Bitch, I met my nigga way before the BBL (ha-ha)
Bitches twice my age, but ain't half his pay (yeah)
If he ain't get more than me, then he ain't get no play (yeah)
Only business that I mind is the one that pay (one that pay)

Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him
Got me fucked up, I don't trust him (I don't trust him)
If he ain't got more than me, can't fuck him (hell nah)
