Song Name: Super Freaky Girl (with JT & BIA feat. Katie Got Bandz, Akbar V & Maliibu Mitch) - Queen Mix
She's alright (ayo)
That girl's alright with me (this the queen mix right here)
Miami, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, New York
Stand the fuck up (yeah)
Ayo (brr, oop, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I can lick it
I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks
And keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone
He always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-E-A-K (freaky girl)
F-R-E-A-K (freaky girl)
A-K, A-K, A-K
E-A-K (freaky girl)
F-R-E— (uh, JT)
Pink pussy, pink coupe, no roof
Made him eat my pussy leavin' NOBU
Maxed out his card, fuck the total (yeah)
Pulled up for a check, pussy mobile
Freak bitch, legs up, cash too (cash)
Niggas eye fuck me when I pass through (eye)
CC this pussy, you a buy nigga
Can't be broke and be my nigga (no)
Neck froze all year, cold summer
Bad bitch, get him for his pin numbers
Eat the pussy, beat the pussy, drill drummer
Big racks, all I'ma tryna get from him
Yo, Nick'? (What up, JT?)
You the winner (thank you)
And I'm the princess of this shit

Gang, gang got the hammer and the wrench (some gyal ah freak, gyal ah freak)
Why you body that verse like that? (Gyal ah freak, freak, freak, freak)
Uh

If I'm takin' the dick (I'ma take it, I'ma take it)
And I got ninety-nine problems
'Cept for makin' it fit (oh)
I see some bitches, mini-me's
And it's makin' me sick (ew)
I'm just the realest bitch you seen with Nicki takin' a pic (Barbia)
I like all my diamonds dancin' (uh)
They wanna know if we fuck in a mansion
Mmm, ask Nicki
If I'm in the room, then shit get sticky
I'm so bad I could touch myself again
Fuck myself like the Clermont twins (uh)
He wanna fuck on all my friends (uh)
I'm too rich for an OnlyFans
Ayo, Drillary Clinton
I'm a very freaky girl
So don't bring me to mama's (uh-huh)
If I pull up with that blicky
Stickin' out of my Prada (bang-bang)
And I ain't goin' if you broke, so go get you some dollars (okay)
I get my own, you know the saying
"Mo Money, Mo Problems"
He like 'em freaky, pussy squeaky
Give me that tongue, make it leaky
I make it wet, nickname Fiji (ooh)
Let him record me, turn it to me, me (yeah)
Now he only seeing me, me
Out on his man, I told him to leave me (on God)
You don't love me, you love that I'm freaky
Can't play with my heart, better play with your wee-wee (hahahaha)
AK
Told him, "Leave that bitch alone
She ain't fuckin' you right" (Fuck her)
You can beat it, but you gotta wear a glove like Mike (yeah)
You know the dick real good, he be doin' it right (I'm on it)

While his bitch blowin' up my phone every other night (uh-huh)
But I can't argue with no bum bitch
I'm cool J, take a LL (fuck, yeah)
And I'm too player to ever kiss and tell (shh)
Your nigga spend a forty right at Chanel
Then I send him back to you like, "Farewell"
He give me left strokes, back strokes

Ayo, New York, Malii
He wanna eat it, if he bite it
I'ma turn 'round and fight him
I'ma put this pussy on him
Have him sleepin' like NyQuil
What's up daddy? He like, "Mami, I jacked UE's from Biden"
I'm like, "Oh, just keep me fly"
Drippy stylin', profilin', uh
'Cause these bitches be eaters and bottom feeders (uh)
I been had stripes like I'm down with Adidas (uh)
Bitches on my body 'cause it's follow the leader (uh)
Niggas on my body 'cause I'm hot like a heater
Price going up like a cab with a meter
Bad little bitty, they be fiendin' to meet her
Bad little bitty, they be fiendin' to be her
Whole lotta money like Nicki and BIA
Keep your two cents, bitch, this ain't a meter
I ain't talking Spanish when I say, "Señorita"
Told that bitch ghostwriter, "Yo, send your reader"
Oh, you ain't know, ho? Ask Wikipedia
These bitches hungry, guess I'm just greedier
These bitches ugly, my bitches prettier
Horseback ridin', I be like, "Giddy up"
When I touch a city, paint it red like graffiti up
I ain't gotta beg for sympathy from the media
Eediat, mm-mm, haha, ha, hahaha, ha, haha
Mm-mm-mm, mmmm
