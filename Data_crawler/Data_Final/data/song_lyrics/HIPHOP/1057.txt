Song Name: Believe What I Say
(Yo) yo (check our situation), yo
My men and my women
(Yo) yo (check our situation), yo
My men and my wom-
You need something unexpected (yo, yo), some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected (yo, yo), and still feel protected
Just one time for the record (yo, yo), just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message (yo, yo), don't agree with the methods
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doing waking me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play something that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't want my mind alerting
People saying tweeting gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurting?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
Have these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo
Nail me to the cross with long nails like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was asking for
I gave you every single thing you was asking for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be going through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'd know
Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes
Things I cried about I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but she didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe... man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughing at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (the wall...)
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (right on, right on)
One last sparkle to follow
