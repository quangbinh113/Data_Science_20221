Song Name: Night Away (Dance) (feat. Tion Wayne)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(Yoshi)
(Good job, Sho!)
Met a few girls that I liked
Gorgeous hips, gorgeous eyes (ah-ha)
They broke my heart on a sly
They didn't ride, it's fine 'cah I ain't got time for a wife (no way)
Too many girls that I've liked
Can't be wife, ain't got time
She wanna be my queen for the night
But I gotta chase dough, not chase her thighs
She wanna
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
(She wanna) she wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs
There was Brenda (mm), La Tisha (mm), Lisa (mm), Tanisha (ah-ha)
Nicky, she a diva
Since she got a new boyfriend, I ain't seen her (ah-ha)
Snapchat Sophie B, and Athena
Just playing games I don't really want either
Heart so cold if I'm keepin' it real
'Cause she need me, I don't need her (I don't)
Who's who?
I'ma do me, I beg you do you, you
To tango, it takes to two, two
Focus on my own moves, yeah
She wanna
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs
(Mm-mm)
It was Sabrina and Lucy (grrt)
Before the rap ting, I was bookie (mm-mm)
You would've thought I was Harry Styles, the way I always had Louis (boom)
I got a brownin' looking all Asian (bad)
Say she wanna link Wizzy and J1
Even though I got BRIT nomination, the WAP come bigger than A1 (brrah)
We can't go there, it's all long (long)
If you don't wanna hear, you'll feel it
I got a young boy move, Jackson (brah, brah)
Because he just wan' beat it (ayy)
And she my babe's, she's no one else
Back your mash and just corrode them (mm-mm)
True, say I've come a long way from Feltham (brah, brah)
She love bad man so just (brah, brah)
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs (dargs, dargs)
Still young and lit
And she don't know that I just turned 16
'Cause I'm in charts, she thinks I'm rich
More pending checks than Burberry
Yo, she asked me to follow her socials
That's the reason I antisocial
Still dropping viral vocals
Worldwide, but I'm still so local
Who's who?
I'ma do me, I beg you do you, you
To tango, it takes to two, two
Focus on my own moves, yeah
She wanna
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I-I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs
Dance the night away, we still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to-
Dance the night away, live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm the dargs
