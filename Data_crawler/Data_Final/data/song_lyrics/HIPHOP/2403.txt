Song Name: She Likes My Tattoos
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
She's the best thing, I don't wanna stress her out
She was right still
I've been needing alcohol to fix how I feel, aye
You were right then
I let all my demons sit and rot inside my head, again
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
She's the best thing, I don't wanna stress her out
She was right still
I've been needing alcohol to fix how I feel, aye
You were right then
I let all my demons sit and rot inside my head, again
I'm sending out an S.O.S to save my soul
'Cause all these alcohols gonna take control and all my
Demons come out at night
And I'm scared to let you see 'em
And I'm scared to break your heart
'Cause every time you leave me, I get sad and fall apart
Baby, welcome to the freak show, ooh
Where all you see is me
And all you feel is fake
Breathe
Breathe me inside
Breathe
Baby, take my hand, you'll be alright
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
She's the best thing, I don't wanna stress her out
She was right still
I've been needing alcohol to fix how I feel, aye
You were right then
I let all my demons sit and rot inside my head, again
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
She's the best thing, I don't wanna stress her out
She was right still
I've been needing alcohol to fix how I feel, aye
You were right then
I let all my demons sit and rot inside my head, again
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
And the next move is all that I need
Wake up, get fucked up, girl, take my hand
I want what you got, so can I have it?
I want you
So tell me what you're wanting from me
She likes my tattoos
Malibu and coke mixed with some orange juice
She can't tell lies, she'll just say I love you
Ain't no telling what she gon' do on her next move
She's the best thing, I don't wanna stress her out
She likes my tattoos
