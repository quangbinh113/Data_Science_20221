Song Name: Vicious
Who is that, that nigga that keep playin' with them bands? (Bands)
You know when your nigga get some shit he never had?
Cashin' out the Rari, max it out to make you mad (woah)
All my hoes tap out, they so fufu, thought it was facts
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
And I-
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious

That's a one-way flight from Pittsburgh, woah, woah

I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
And I-
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
