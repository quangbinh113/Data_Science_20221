Song Name: Costa Rica (feat. The Kid LAROI) - Remix
Mmh, mmh, mmh
Give me a two, give me a go, uh
Yeah, I'm back, uh
Ayy, like Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
Now I'm living on my heaven shit
Louboutins, on my devil shit
Told her kick rock and she kickin' up pebbles, bitch
Slide with a truck 'cause I stay on my Travis shit
My bitch she bad with a booty and freckles, bitch
We in the foreign, the gas on the pedal shit (Skrrt)
Baby my sign, man, for her, I go steppin' shit
There ain't no time, 'cause for you, this forever shit (Ooh, ooh)
Chopper go (Boom, brr, brr)
Fuckin' on me in the studio
Fallin' for me got you moody, though
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
Walkin' like I'm in this bitch
Sixteen with a fourty piece on my wrist, I-I
I'm in the back of the 'Bach with a thot
And she throwin' it back and I'm thinkin', damn
Is this love? This ain't love and if it's fuck
'Cause I can't love no thot
Can't do this with you, I won't, I'm not
Gotta do this on my own, I got
Plans to make it, bands to save
Lil' baby I can't be fuckin' with you
Don't act surprised, I been this way
Lil' bitch this here ain't nothin' new
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat fit Billionaire
