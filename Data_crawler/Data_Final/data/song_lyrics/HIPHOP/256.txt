What they gon' do?
What they gon' do?
What they gon' do?
My wrist on ooh (Ooh)
My wrist on, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Hey)
Southside on the track, yeah
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga
I can feel the money (I can feel the racks)
I got some young niggas pull on the opps
And they kill for money (They slide they slide)
You ever felt a zombie? (Who?)
Yo' body gon' smell like vomit (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I done went bad (Bad)
Ever since I got checks I don't run and get mad
That's not how I react (React)
But she throwin' it back, I done threw it right back
I spent 40K flat (Flat)
Don't worry my nigga, get part of the clip
So I got it right back (Right back)
By the way, way that it's going down
It's been going up
I can't hold nothin' back, I won't hold you up
I can't fit all my pain in this styro' cup
Always talk to myself 'cause it's only us
Always deep in my mind, don't know who to trust
I been rollin' 'round town feelin' woozy
Tryna ride on my side, I get choosy
I don't know who is tryin' to use me (Hey)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin')
Hoppin' out the 'Ghini ('Ghini)
All my wishes came true like a genie (Wishes)
All my money comin' blue when they print it
That nigga Offset (Brr-brr)
Fuck you in a sentence (Rah, rah, rah, rah)
See you in a minute (See you in a minute)
I see you in a Rolls and it's rented (Rolls)
Nigga tried to try me like I was a gimmick (Exposed)
Now I got a number one and they hear me (Number one)
You heard that?
I was trappin' and I had to take a bird bath (Yeah)
Guns on me, I was going down the wrong path
I'm humble with the money and I don't cry (No)
Beat me at the game, I'ma grab it (Grab it)
I stock out my paints in the cabin (Stop-stop)
Drippin' too clean like a napkin (Drip-drip-drip)
She was a bean with a rack out (The bean)
Money to the racks so I lap 'em (Woo)
Don't give em a formula, I cap 'em (Nah)
I'm from the jungle I'm an animal (Rah)
You bitches ain't shit, they scandalous (Woo)
Knock his head off, I commanded him (Boo)
I'm from the bando, my daddy had abandoned me (Bando)
Momma tried to cover up and bandage me (Mama)
I'm the first one to lead the whole legacy (Legacy)
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga
I can feel the money (I can feel the racks)
I got some young niggas pull on the opps
And they kill for money (They slide, they slide)
You ever felt a zombie? (Who?)
Yo' body gon' smell like vomit (Ooh)
They thought I would fail, I conquer (Fail)
I swim with the sharks, piranhas (Piranha)
You tattletale, informants (Twelve)
I move like a boss, I'm important (Boss)
I fuel up the 'Rari, performance (Skrt)
I been left out the streets like an orphan (Streets)
I was strong but I wanted to forfeit (Strong)
I got famous and rich, now I'm corporate (Uh)
By the way, way, it's going down
It's been going up I can't hold nothing back
I won't hold you up
I can't fit all my pain in this styro cup
Always talk to myself 'cause its only us
Always deep in my mind, I don't know who to trust
I been rollin' 'round town feeling woozy
Tryna ride on my side, I get choosy
I don't know who is tryin' to use me
Them shooters gon' slide and it's quiet
Ain't noboody here (On God)
I nut on her titties and booty
She cleanin' up the residue with her lip (Straight up)
Every nigga cross me, dawg, on God
I'ma catch him, I don't care if it's in 10 years (21)
Lost my bruddas to the street, we gon' slide
Kill some, go home and shed tears (True story)
When it's time to ride (Slide, Slide, Slide)
Catch me in the 6 with a blicky (Blicky)
Nigga took the stand, he a Mickey (Mickey)
Niggas get to tellin' when it's sticky (Sticky)
Can't believe you niggas tryna diss me (What?)
Show you how fast I'ma get him (On God)
Then I find his body by 3 Mississippi (On God)
Richard Mille on me, cost half a ticket dog (Half a ticket)
Need to open up a bunny ranch
'Cause I got all the bitches, dawg (On God)
Why you in the car if you ain't gon' shoot?
You another witness dog (Lil' bitch)
Them big ass, cheap ass veneers
Y'all need another dentist dawg (Straight up)
Been fuckin' with 'Set since way back, dawg
This shit go way back (Way, way back)
Disrespect, we don't play that
You can get shot in your wave cap (Whole lotta shots)
You was in the house playin' 'Tendo
I was on the block where the J's at (On God)
I'ma stand on it if I say that
Say it with your chest when you say that (21, 21)
Nigga (Pussy, bitch)
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga
I can feel the money (I can feel the racks)
I got some young niggas pull on the opps
And they kill for money (They slide, they slide)
You ever felt a zombie? (Who?)
Yo' body gon' smell like vomit (Ooh)
They thought I would fail, I conquer (Fail)
I swim with the sharks, piranhas (Piranha, rah)
You tattletale, informants (Twelve)
I move like a boss, I'm important (Boss)
I fuel up the 'Rari, performance (Skrt)
I been left out the streets like an orphan (Streets)
I was strong but I wanted to forfeit (Strong)
I got famous and rich, now I'm corporate (Uh, hey)
