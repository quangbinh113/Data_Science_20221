Song Name: For Real
Damn DJ Plugg, you just kill-
Bobby Kritical
For real, for real, for real, yeah
Sleep on 'em that's Tempur-Pedic
Get the green like it's kale
Pockets they fat just like Kenan
Told her I love her, ain't mean it
That's because I hit the meanest
You heard that I am from Mars
I heard that you was from Venus
I met that bitch in a meeting
I fucked that bitch from the meeting
I been was planning to leave her
So I just left it to Jesus, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Lil Vert like Gerald, told that girl to cheer up
Fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her she embarrassed
Heard your whip Gary Barbara, ew
Wait, for real? For real? For real?
Diamonds they wet like a seal
Diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal
Everybody know it ain't real
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
Won't say no names but my niggas they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up
Look at my chain, throwing salt 'cause it's snowing
Vivienne West with my fur looking polar
My Gosha from Dover, I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me, don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing, don't think that I ain't noticed
I left my door and I forgot to close it
Boy better keep it sealed
Fuck around, get killed
Fuck around, get drilled
Cut your hands if you steal
Whip it up like a meal
I just made me a mill'
Money jumping out my pockets
Tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone
Leave me alone
I'm on TV, with the VVS, so I 3-D my stones, yeah
We really don't get along
She anemic, I'm more chill
Had to keep this shit for real
All the way 'til the beat build
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
