Song Name: Everywhere You Go
Oh, you 'bout it now, what's your body count?
What your stash like? That ain't no large amount
Nigga, what your crib look like? Know that's your momma house
Nigga, why you yellin', "Free him"? You ain't gon' bond him out
Nigga don't know what that drama 'bout
You ain't really no stepper if you can't do it when the sun is out
If you know like I know (like I know)
You better not never leave your pole (oh, oh)
Keep it everywhere you go (everywhere you go)
They'll probably slide on you, just to get some stripes
He was only 17, they gave him life
If you know like I know, you better play your cards right
We been in the trap all night
If you know like I know (like I know)
You better not never leave your pole
Keep it everywhere you go
You know they schemin' on the low
If you know like I know, you know like I do (like I do)
Keep your enemies close, and pray your family stay true (pray your family stay true)
When it's too much to cope, I'll be the one you run to (one you run to)
Left you at your low, but you left when I got there too (hey-hey, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
If you know like I know, you can't trust nobody (nobody)
Niggas say they solid, but be the ones who be plottin'
How you steal from me? I put the bread loaf in your pocket (nobody)
Niggas bite the hand that feed 'em, then complain about the profit (nobody)
Stop it (ayy)
Me and my bro tryna kick in the door, when a nigga was broke, we was losin' hope (brrrt)
Out the window with the Glock, when my nigga from with the lick, I had to let it blow (brrt-brrt)
Knew that nigga was a hoe, he ain't shoot it with me when I had to unload
Say they're real, then they fold, who gon' stick to the code?
(Who gon' stick to the code?) (Mm, if shit go down?)
If you know like I know
I'ma always be a real nigga, uh, solid as they come
Nigga, we at band practice, hunnid round drums
He been talkin' on the internet, hop out, he lookin' dumb
That Choppa soundin' like a giant
Talkin', thump, thump-thump, thump-thump
And we go dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb
Can't beef with him 'cause he a bum, I fucked his bitch and left her 'lone
Got too much smoke up in my lungs
You a gangsta, or a bitch? Make your mind up
Ain't no more room up in my gang, can't none of you pussies sign up
Got a hunnid dollar line-up, just like layin' on these bitches
Better not have sex with these bitches
If you know like I know
These bitches only want your dough
If you know like I know (like I know)
You better not never leave your pole, oh, oh
Keep it everywhere you go (everywhere you go)
They'll probably slide on you, just to get some stripes
He was only 17, they gave him life
If you know like I know, you better play your cards right (cards right)
We been in the trap all night
If you know like I know (like I know)
You better not never leave your pole
Keep it everywhere you go
You know they schemin' on the low
I'ma always be a real nigga, uh, solid as they come
