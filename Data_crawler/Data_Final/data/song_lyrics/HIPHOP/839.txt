Song Name: Invincible
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
I said, I feel invincible (Yoz, what you tellin' me?)
They like, "Poppy, what you gettin' to?" (To, to)
I pop a Perc', go retarded, wait
Haha, hahaha
Yeah (Ahaha), yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah (To, to, grrt, grrt)
Yeah, yeah
I said, I feel invincible (Huh)
It's a hundred niggas in the spot
I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' through 'em)
It's 85 just to walk on
I don't talk to these niggas (Nah)
'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (Corny)
I'm feeling horny (I'm feeling horny)
And I shoot like Robert Horry (Horry)
I'm off this percolator shit (Woo)
I got a percolated bitch (Percolated bitch)
I give her this percolated dick (Yeah)
I show her these percolated tricks
Pop Smoke, they know who run the city
Pop Smoke, nigga, you can ask Diddy
Pop Smoke bust up a Citi or TD
Pop Smoke goin' 50 for 50
I pop a Perc, go retarded
Then shoot up the party, then change the artillery
Energy
I'm givin' nothin' but energy
I give her Perky and Hennessy
I give two shots to the enemy, hope he remember me
What the fuck a nigga tellin' me?
I spent 250 on my wrist
I spent 250 on my bitch
Double G, niggas know I'm a threat
Walk in the spot and turn everybody Crip
DJ Clue, my nigga fuck with the Woos
Tell SpinKing to play it back (Back)
While the Woos throw the bag
They know I'm shootin' for the stars
Aimin' for the moon (Moon)
I shoot at any opp (Opp)
'Cause niggas know I'm Woo (Woo)
Send that nigga to the medic
Everything raw, no edit
Pop Smoke did it
I said, I feel invincible (Huh)
It's a hundred niggas in the spot
I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' through 'em)
It's 85 just to walk on
I don't talk to these niggas (Nah)
'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (Corny)
I'm feeling horny (I'm feeling horny)
And I shoot like Robert Horry (Horry)
I'm off this percolator shit (Woo)
I got a percolated bitch (Percolated bitch)
I give her this percolated dick (Yeah)
I show her these percolated tricks
Pop Smoke, they know who run the city
Pop Smoke, nigga, you can ask Diddy
Pop Smoke bust up a Citi or TD
Pop Smoke goin' 50 for 50
