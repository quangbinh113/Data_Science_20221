Song Name: Stick Talk
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the scene ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us 'cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us 'cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you want dope
I forgot, ain't got a word on body count
Riding in the club, barely tripping now
Ordered up a sofa, told her, "Ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Get it little harder, get the Benz
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the scene ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us 'cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
Fully loaded, whip fully loaded clips
Fuck her with my niggas, I ain't smoke a zoot
Red eyes in, I got them zones with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the scene ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
