Song Name: Still Here (feat. Cordae)
It ain't the same in this world but I'm still here
Gotta be strong as I can having all these fears
Being stuck in these chains for so many years
But I gotta play the game 'cause I'm holding all of these tears
Uh, hot summers with cold winters
Empty stomachs with no dinners
Fast losers and slow winners, real niggas, no hoe in us
Never pretenders, all authentic, my nigga
Uh, I know the struggling very well
They say life ain't no fairytale and real music barely sells
My lil' homie just made bail
I heard that Earth's a strange hell, as a reason I can't tell
Vision clouded, wires routed, nothin' new about it
Getting high, thinkin' 'bout that cash, what would we do without it?
Niggas with the least to offer usually who the loudest
Meditation, smoke that medication through the mountains
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I heard You, found myself and I'm searching
We been sinning but won't do it on purpose
Give it my all, goin' harder but my heart is still hurting
What did we do to deserve it? Yeah
It ain't the same in this world but I'm still here
Gotta be strong as I can having all these fears
Being stuck in these chains for so many years
But I gotta play the game 'cause I'm holding all of these tears
Just reminiscing about the days a nigga needed whippings
The way I'm actin' nowadays, a nigga really miss them
No real location, moving around, that's how a nigga living
A rolling stone, I lay my hat down, well, you get the picture
With words, I'm tryna depict, and some people would never get it
Some people pretend to get it just to act like they can fit in
Playin' the hell out these women, most women cheat on they man
Just to find nobody's better and expect for him to understand
I mean it's cool to be broke, I mean it's cool to be raw
Yeah, I sound dumb as a bitch, that's what I'm hearing from y'all
I can't be happy and gangster, 'cause these niggas will test you
Bring the problems to me, on Jesus, I promise you I'll bless you, yeah
It ain't the same in this world but I'm still here
Gotta be strong as I can having all these fears
Being stuck in these chains for so many years
But I gotta play the game 'cause I'm holding all of these tears
