Song Name: It's All on U
Antt did the track
(Beat gang)
Huh
Yeah, never let them pussy n- play me
Put that on my baby, forgis on a maybach truck
It cost two-eighty
Richer than them niggas that be hatin'
Shooters like McGrady in kentucky
With that fetti goin' crazy, (huh)
Stick tucked, I let my chain hang
Rich and gang bang
Leave a fifty in this b- to rain in, (huh)
Bustin' shit, don't wear no plain jane
Hundred-thousand dollar rollie scottdale
An AP on the same hand
You with the opps, that mean you ain't my mans
You movin' like the cops, can't take a chance
Thirty-thousand in my pants
Yeah, dog shit in my pockets, where your bands?
Hit the show with thirty hitters
I'm with Cudi, he'll blick before he land
Cash it all the time, don't wait for shit
Twenty chains, crazy kid
Rich n-, I can't f- no basic b-
You never been no boss, you drankin' tris
You never been no shooter, you's a b-
Quay-quay with me, he got stick, (huh)
Pour the wocky up and drop a six
Icy than a b-, put my city on the map
We in the mix
I been slimin' shit out since a jit
Cuban cost two bricks
We got all them thirsty hoes takin' pics
You wanna sign me? Yellin' out three mill'
Tweakin' in this b-, just popped a pill
Gang 'nem yellin' out, "Free Kill"
Yeah, f- a record label, we too real
F- award shows, we in the field
Shoot that chopper like I'm skilled, n-
I love my lil bean 'cause she real
She want me at my best but love me at my worst
Still I can't let 'em kill bill
I keep three glocks and a stick
One regular, one got a d-
One of 'em fully, with a fifty and a switch
A n- diss, his ass better stay focused
Nowadays, the real n- be doin' a lot of ho shit
Yeah, you know me, I'm on my zone shit
My n- don't speak english
All they know is when we pull up, hop out, squeeze and
I'm f- demonin' him
Bullets miss, I'm immortal
And I'm bossin' up, I got the 'rari truck on pre-order
The fifty for the richard mill'
I ain't even see a quarter
I need my twenty-five, where I reside, these n- down shorter
I got expensive taste
I'm drankin' wock', I scrape
Takin' zaza to the face, on a private jet in either state
They say they down for me but really fakin'
Ain't one to help, put on my shoes, man
I couldn't tie my laces (yeah)
Like John Gotti, beat a thousand cases
We keepin' people straight, they doin' voodoo way in Haiti
I'ma speak my mind everytime
I don't care how you take it
I keep it real, and for that all the real n- embrace me
Jumped off the tour bus and all the b- start to chase me
But then my pockets start spreadin'
I big faced it
The cheese, the cheese done got me beefin' with my lady
She pulled up to the ugly corner
Jumped out, tryna mace me
(Beat gang)
