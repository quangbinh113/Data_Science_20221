Song Name: D.M.B.
Yeah
Fake homies do turn to fake phony dudes
Let me find out that you phony too
Yeah, fake homies do turn to fake
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my b-
Hold my gun, load it up, count my slugs (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my b- (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup
Be my b-, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut
Be my cunt, yeah, so what?
F- them hoes (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
F- they talkin' 'bout?
'Cause they don't know nothin'
Time to call it what it was
First I thought it wasn't nothin'
Probably think I wanna hit and run
Bad girls wanna have fun
I don't want no goody two-Shoes, no, none
I ain't no priest, I ain't gon' preach
I ain't want no goodie-goodie, but she still praise Jesus
I share my clothes with my b- like she my sis
I don't beat my b-, I need my b-
She clean my crib, she feed my friends
She keep my secret, she keep my fridge packed, my freezer lit
That's how deep I get, negative degrees
What's the type of b- I need?
Roll my, roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bi- (that's my b-)
Hold my, hold my, load it up, count my slugs (that's my b-)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my b- (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup
Be my bitch, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut
Be my cunt, yeah, so what?
F- them hoes (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
F- they talkin' 'bout?
'Cause they don't know nothin'
She got bank accounts too
With big amounts, sh- you couldn't count
Just pick the number that you couldn't count to
Like an attitude, curve a n- when she didn't have to
Around the lords like a British counsel
With all these sticks around you
We can build you a wooden castle
Got a penthouse, see the Bronx Zoo
Got a town house with the town view
Got surround sound with the top down
Ride through Allerton up to Soundview
I was lost then, but I found you
I was slim thick with a bounce too
It's your tough love that I'm bound to
I f- it up, then it's round two
Roll my, roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my b- (that's my b-)
Hold my, hold my, load it up, count my slugs (that's my b-)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my b- (I fell in love with you)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup
Be my b-, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut
Be my cunt, yeah, so what?
F- them hoes (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin' (I fell in love with you)
F- they talkin' 'bout?
'Cause they don't know nothin'
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
Baby (I fell in love with you)
Hey, it's been a little time since we both (I fell in love with you)
Felt full since our first encounter (my first encounter)
And baby (I fell in love with you)
Don't let another n- try my baby, girl you know I'm one call away
(I wish a n-would, I'm one phone call away)
It's nothin' (sh- ain't nothin', baby)
And baby (I fell in love with you)
My angel and my Goddess, when my head get clouded
My head get cloudy, my thoughts get cloudy
You're my soulmate, my Goddess (my soulmate)
And baby (I fell in love with you)
Took a little time in a gray place (I fell in love with you)
For nothin', no thanks
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my b-
Hold my gun, load it up, count my slugs (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my b- (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup
Be my b-, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut
Be my cunt, yeah, so what?
F- them hoes (that's my b-)
They don't know nothin'
F- they talkin' 'bout?
'Cause they don't know nothin'
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
