Song Name: TikTok
Ayy, man, if you got your motherfuckin' lemon pepper steppers on, man (yeah, if you got your bitches on)
Tie them hoes up tight 'til where you ain't got no circulation in your ankles (you can't even walk, nigga)
'Cause, 'cause vibe to the song, man (for real), if you got your shit on, look
Ayy, if you got that shit on, take it off
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip, then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok, no, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop

Flip, flip, flip, run a nigga out his flip-flops
Flop, flop, flop, crack a bitch off a TikTok
Rock, rock, rock, don't stop like you runnin' from the cop, cop, cops
Let this thing pop, pop at the opp, opp, opp
I just got the drop, drop at a nigga drop-drop (drop, drop)
Stop and roll, grab the pole, let me know what you know
If you got that shit on
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right

Ayy, do your stuff, pick it up, drop it down to the ground
Round for round, pound for pound
Make it sound like this sound
Round of applause for the cause
Don't worry what it cost, Blueface, baby, I'm a boss
If I lost, take a loss
Get it back, got a crack
Lift that ass with a jack
Put a bitch on her back
That's a fact, I'ma mack
She gon' do it for a stack
Stack it up, stack it up, grey cup, do your stuff
Pussy wet like a tub
We gon' do it in the shower for a hour
