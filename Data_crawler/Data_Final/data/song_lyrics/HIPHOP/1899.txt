Song Name: Got Your Money (feat. Kelis)
Oh, baby
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls, to, oh
All the pretty girls in the world
And the ugly girls too
'Cause to me you're pretty anyway, baby
You give me your number, I'll call you up
You act like your pussy on interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fuckin' me
But I have a little problem with you not fuckin' me
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
'Cause you say you got my baby and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No, it's bad bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pistols
Dirty won't be havin' it in this house
'Cause bitch I'll cripple your style
Now that you heard my charmin' voice
You couldn't get another nigga, the coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better gimme that money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Yo, so I glanced at the girl, girl glanced at me
I whispered in her ear, "You wanna be with me?"
You wanna look pretty though in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you're caught up in the holy hhost trance
If you stop, I'ma put some killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
FBI, don't you be watchin' me
I don't want no problem, cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you cannot be found
I'm just Dirt Dog trying' to make some money
So give me my streaks and gimme my honey
Radios play this all day every day
Recognize I'm a fool and you lovin' me
None of you, nuh, better look at me funny
Nuh, you know my name now gimme my money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Yo, yo, nigga play it in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out and let me hold it tight
You're looking at my wrist saying, "That's so nice!"
The price fits the diamonds, shining in disco lights
Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'ma get this money and rob them
Lucky Dog when I won the lotto
Ran up on my car for carrying Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass
Stop annoying me, yeah, I play my music loud
It take the bastard Ol' Dirty to move the crowd
They say, "He had his dick in his mouth"
Eddie Murphy taught me that back at the house
Now gimme my money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey
