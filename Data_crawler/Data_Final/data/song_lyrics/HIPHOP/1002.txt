Song Name: Rent Free (feat. GRACEY)
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me
But my name's on the tip of your tongue (mhm)
And that's on you, baby
You, baby, I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue?
That's on you, baby, you-you, baby
Livin' in the city 'cause I wanna (yeah)
Tippin' many drivers in the city with a Hunna (woo)
Quarantine won't stop me in the city, I'm a runner (nah)
Strava with a 5K under 22 when I fly away (geez)
Pink Vaporfly when I zoom
Eight figure net if I enter any room
Any tune that I'm hoppin' on is gonna Sonic Boom (Sonic Boom)
And now my phone is ringin' (you-you, baby)
Hit me out the blue, but then I never give an F (rah)
Black and white, I keep it true, don't try me like a ref (damn)
Mixin' with the cutter in my own kitchen with a chef (mm)
Help so many people that they call me UNICEF
For they all beggin' for the recipe (ayy)
Son of a man that's been workin' the hardest
To passin' out the energy, they pissin' on my enemies
No stress over here, bossin' in my Moncler, nigga
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me (you don't fuck with me)
But my name's on the tip of your tongue
And that's on you, baby (that's on you, baby)
You, baby, I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue? (The tip of your tongue)
That's on you, baby, you-you, baby
And I'm livin' rent-free
Big bangers comin' from the ego theory
Callin' Charlie just to spend it on his jewelry
Now I'm showin' it off 'cause I'm unruly
Man's in everythin' like a neutron (ayy)
And I keep on winnin' even when I do wrong (ayy)
Too strong (woo), winnin' with my winners, but it's too long (mm)
Still, I come with a drip so fresh that they all wanna tweak
Lookin' at a Tory like I paid for the meat
Lookin' at the catalog, paid for the beef
Lookin' at the analogue, paid for the grief (you-you, baby)
I'm a real bad man if you're on the wrong side
Got bare space for that piggyback ride
If I want it, I get it (yeah)
Never regret it (yeah)
If I go dyin', I'm dyin' in credit, ah
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah (mm-mm, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me (you don't fuck with me, baby)
But my name's on the tip of your tongue
And that's on you, baby (that's on you, that's on you, baby)
You, baby, I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue?
That's on you, baby (that's on you, that's on you, baby), you-you, baby
Mm-mm-mm-mm, yeah-ay
Yeah, mm, yeah-ay
Ah-mm
Mm, mm, mm
