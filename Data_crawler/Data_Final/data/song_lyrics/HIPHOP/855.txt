Song Name: Never Bend Never Fold
Yeah (Chopsquad)
Herb, what up, my nigga?
Yeah (uh), yeah, okay
Talk to 'em, okay, ayy
Rich niggas with me (rich niggas)
Real niggas with me (real niggas)
Real killers with me (real killers)
Send a nigga six feet (bah)
We be totin' blickys
Get your whip, Swiss cheese (bah)
Think I'm out of Tennessee
Bitch I'm with the grizzlies (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
Ayy, rappers all the time but we savages at the crib
Tell Minnie pull up foreign, tint the windows on this bitch (yeah)
You know we plan on shootin' first, if we ain't bulletproofed this bitch (grrah)
Keep a nigga with me that's gon' tell the police that they is (they is)
Think a nigga drunk, I put that forty to his wheel (bah)
If we don't go on a chase, know I'ma do 'em big (skrr)
We went on two hits a day when brodie bought a seal (back to back)
I can't even have the cake, feel like I'm doin' trick (woo)
And that's no bap (no cap)
Had a hunnid at my momma house, before rap (that's before rap)
Left a nigga with his strap like he had no strap (dropped it)
Know somebody gotta die, we put it on cap (on God)
And you can't sell a dime bag, bitch that's four strap (this shit raw)
We still live some young niggas (like some young niggas)
We still live some young niggas (like some young niggas)
Ayy, same guns as our young niggas (ayy, brr)
But we got money like some old niggas (like some old niggas)
Ayy, you can't come around, you told nigga (get the fuck off, nigga)
Uh, can't talk bad about my bros, nigga (can't say shit about 'em)
Know we stickin' to the code, nigga (whatever we doin')
Never bend, never fold, nigga (yeah, yeah)
Herbo wanna shoot 'em, I'm like, "Broski, we got children" (yeah)
I was bein' G Herbo, like, "Broski, we got millions" (spend that shit)
My hitman say he hidin', I'm like, "Find that nigga, spin again"
His momma pulled up in a Lamb' and I can't find that nigga ceiling (drop)
Seein' six figures turn to seven, what a feeling (go)
Got the killers itchin', let 'em at 'em, let 'em get 'em (stretch his ass)
Niggas with they hell in the Heaven, so we chillin' (fuck 'em)
Like we go to school up at seven but we drillin' (yeah)
Askin' teachers, "Can I hit the bathroom?" but I'm shootin' dice
If I lose I'm robbin' niggas, drop that shit or lose your life (put that shit down)
I'm a grizzly but I'm like a zebra, I got too much stripes (too many)
How I take the feeling, bend some corner, stole that pipe (throw that)
Me and hoes be playin' catch, I throw a text, they throw they neck
Boy, take your shit off in this bitch, you know I'ma throw that check
Flexing 'round my niggas, you better show them upmost respect
We bully niggas on that court, fuck around and press the ref (why you start shit?)
We still live some young niggas (like some young niggas)
We still live some young niggas (like some young niggas)
Ayy, same guns as our young niggas (ayy, brr, DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
But we got money like some old niggas (like some old niggas)
Ayy, you can't come around, you told nigga (get the fuck off, nigga)
Uh, can't talk bad about my bros, nigga (can't say shit about 'em)
Know we stickin' to the code, nigga (whatever we doin')
Never bend, never fold, nigga (yeah, yeah)
