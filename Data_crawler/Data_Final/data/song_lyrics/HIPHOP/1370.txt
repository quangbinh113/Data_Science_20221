Song Name: Goin Up
(Grrt, bow)
Goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, started on the corner (up)
Bently Truck, red guts, couple milli' up, could've been a goner (up)
I put on for my city, youngins wanna do it, this ain't no persona (up)
Richard Mille on my wrist, oh shit, nigga, you say what you wanna (grrt, baow)
I was real from the start, still kinda hard, no love for informers
Been a real nigga, still a real nigga, they still think I'm a performer
Focus, I better my life (yeah), ain't have no place on that corner (no)
They so, so mad (so, so mad), but I'ma keep goin' up
Trap for a livin' (trap), I was flippin' that pack for a livin' (pack, pack)
Who'd thought it'd be rap for a livin'? Back in the day I was packin' a Smith (grrt baow)
Make up my mind, then passin' the vision
Who put the block on the maddest petition? (Me)
I ain't even finna act what it isn't
I'm sturdy, gotta move with tactical decisions
Broski really good at scorin', shootin' while it's pourin'
He ain't good at passin' precision
Late nights tryna catch an opp, hit him in his top (boom, boom, boom)
Play it cool, get back to the business (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Young nigga livin' the gang way
Every nigga here with me the same way (okay)
Just a youngin, was playin' that corner (that corner)
Now I'm up and they all on my dangling (my way, oh, oh)
Where I come from, them trenches we, "Ooh" shit
I don't care 'bout shit, bitch, I'm ruthless (ruthless)
Pourin' up, I ain't sippin' no Henny
But I might just roll up gelato to boost it (boost it)
Suckin' dick, bitch, I buy you a toothpick (yeah)
I can't argue with you 'cause I poof shit (yeah)
And that bag look like you on some fool shit (fuck?)
I'ma still pull a string, no acoustic (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Knew when my mama told me I'm a nuisance
It cost a couple thousand to go stupid (yeah)
Show plus a hundred thousand, are you stupid? (Show)
Straight from the bottom now that youngin' too sick
Can't whip a car unless it's in the deuces (okay)
I'm just a youngin nigga livin' life (okay)
They tryna figure me out like a Rubik's (no)
I dare pussy nigga tryna fight (I dare)
They start duckin', duckin' like they gooses (grrt, bow)
Goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, started on the corner (up)
Bently Truck, red guts, couple milli' up, could've been a goner (up)
I put on for my city, youngins wanna do it, this ain't no persona (up)
Richard Mille on my wrist, oh shit, nigga, you say what you wanna (grrt, bow)
Goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, started on the corner (up)
Bently Truck, red guts, couple milli' up, could've been a goner (up)
I put on for my city, youngins wanna do it, this ain't no persona (up)
Richard Mille on my wrist, oh shit, nigga, you say what you wanna
