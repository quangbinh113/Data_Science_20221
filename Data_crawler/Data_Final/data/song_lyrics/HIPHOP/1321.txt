Song Name: thought i was playing
(Mike WiLL, Mike WilLL)
(Young Rari)
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a tran'
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twins
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin', you know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
What the fuck you pussies must've thought that I was playin' (playin')
Must've thought he couldn't get caught, they buried that boy in the sand (damn)
Wiped that little bitch's noses (slime), it only cost a couple of grand (yup)
Find out he ever stole, I'm choppin' off his hand
Hot like a stove with a pot and the pan, we takin' over the land (ha)
I can go chop up a few blocks again, nigga can't wait to come spin (can't wait to come spin)
I'm out of the way but they pullin' me in, I'm 'bout to commit a sin
I took a lil' loss, now I'm here for the win, niggas don't want me to win
I bought a new car for my twin, this shit ain't just for the trend (nope)
63 AMG Benz (skrrt)
I hit the engine, I put it in sport (skrrt) I'ma fishtail it and spin (skrrt)
Callin' a opp, you can tell him, "It's up"
Know I'ma want some revenge
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a trend
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twins
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin', you know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
Grave digger, big 4L, I'ma made nigga (21)
Say they twins, throw they body in the same river (on God)
Never tucked my tail, I went to war with real killers (pussy)
I'm your wifey surgeon, dawg, I give her lip fillers (pussy)
SF90 cost a M, dumped his Glock like Ye did Kim (21)
Sippin' on pimp juice, watch my brim (21)
How you a shooter? You ain't even hit the rim (on God)
Summertime killing' in Air Force Ones
When it get to winter, I'm steppin' in Timbs (on God)
I called Draco Floyd, give him a uppercut, we hit that boy in the chin
Eight-figure nigga, I'ma drop out (21)
AK, heavy metal, rock out (21)
I'm in yo' hood, what you talkin' 'bout? (21)
Beat on my chest with my gun out (pussy)
I put a house on your head (pussy)
My money long, it won't run out (pussy)
VVS diamonds, the sun out (21)
We just count money for fun now
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a trend
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twins
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin', you know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
