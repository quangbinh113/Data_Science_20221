Song Name: Fade Away
Young Seven make it splash
I'm smokin' doobies to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juggin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
I'm a young nigga straight from the bottom
Won't be long 'til I get to the top
Feel like half of my bros on the rock
This for Smelly and E, I ain't never gonna stop
I was juggin' and grounded, didn't get where I got
At this point in my life, I done seen me a lot
If you're slackin' at work, then I'm takin' your spot
All this VVS diamonds, I'm takin' your watch
I been dealin' so much, I ain't never tell cops
I'ma just lurk 'til I get me the drop
Step out of line, we gon' wait for our time
Yeah, you think you're so low, 'til you finna get popped
Talkin' on smelly, you finna get dropped
All my lil' shooters keep Glizzy, they flock
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block
I'm smokin' doobies to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juggin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
I'm smokin' doobies to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juggin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
Yeah, I miss the way that this shit used to be
Fucking famous hoes in California, this shit new to me
They say that I changed since I got money
Well that's news to me
'Cause through all the bullshit that they threw
I still stay true to me and that's truthfully
Through all the lies and the scrutiny
Through all the times that they used to be
Talkin' down on my name, now they wanna come around
But they ain't new to me
I used to think you was everything
Now you not even cool to me
I used to think you was everything
Yeah, that's how I used to be
And you can not say that I didn't try to make time but I guess time away
Got you in your brain, thinkin' about my mistakes
I don't got the time to waste
I'm smokin' doobies to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juggin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
I'm smokin' doobies to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juggin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
This boy got a hit
