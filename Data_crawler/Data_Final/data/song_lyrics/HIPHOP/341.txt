Song Name: Mannequin Challenge (feat. Juice WRLD)
You good, T-Minus? (Uh)
The Rolls Royce is grey, I've been callin' it granny
I copped the Lamb' truck, and that bitch panoramic (Skrrt)
Gon' fuckin' on lil' shawty, momma and granny
I'm takin' her space and that squish me like sandwiches
Fuck what I did, and fuck all the damage
I'm tryna kill you, and your kid, and your mami (Brr)
I just told the judge, man, fuck what you talkin'
And fuck what you sayin', I'm smokin' these whammies (Hah)
These Percys, these Xannies, I'm pourin' up this Activis (Woo)
I'm failin' this test every time (Yeah)
I fingered this hoe while we ridin' (Yeah)
I'm 'bout to expose you with rhymes (Yeah)
I came out the zoo with these guys (Yeah)
I slept in the woods with the guys (Yeah)
Get out the way when they come (Yeah)
Of course, the whole crew with the shine (woo)
I just did a week in jail, and I caught me three new bitches (No cap)
Before you knew Dapper Dan, bitch I was grandpa drippin' (On God)
I had a million dollars stashed away, in a spot on the west side (Woo)
I bulletproofed the whole car
The stickers on the windows and all of the tires (Yeah)
I gave a million dollars to my dawg, now a nigga worldwide (Yeah)
Yeah, I got a collar on my hoes
I'm puttin' diamonds on her toes
Nigga, we came from cookin' noodles on the stove (Woo, woo, woo)
The Rolls Royce is grey, I've been callin' it granny
I copped the Lamb' truck, and that bitch panoramic (Skrrt)
Gon' fuckin' on lil' shawty, momma and granny
I'm takin' her space and that squish me like sandwiches
Fuck what I did, and fuck all the damage
I'm tryna kill you, and your kid, and your mami (Brr)
I just told the judge, man, fuck what you talkin'
And fuck what you sayin', I'm smokin' these whammies (Hah)

Of course, the whole crew with the shine (Woo)
Off on the Perc' and the Xan' again, yeah (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Walk in the sky like I'm Anakin, yeah (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Double G on me like a mannequin, yeah (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Make 'em freeze like a mannequin challenge in here (Uh huh, uh huh, yeah)
Me and slatt dealin' the damage (Yeah)
Kidnap the children and murder the parents (Yeah)
I went to Mexico, I brought the pesos (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fucked her say, hola, I'm screamin' in Spanish (Yeah)
I got the tool, no Handy Manny (Chk-chk, grra)
You'll get jacked, son, like you Randy (Grra)
I told the bitch to go swallow my kids
I don't even wanna have no family (Yeah)
It's me and Thugger, we rulin' the planet, yeah
We goin' harder than granite
Money old enough to fuck up your granny, yeah
I might go fuck on your granny (Slatt)
The Rolls Royce is grey, I've been callin' it granny
I copped the Lamb' truck, and that bitch panoramic (Skrrt)
Gon' fuckin' on lil' shawty, momma and granny
