Song Name: All Night (BTS World Original Soundtrack) [Pt. 3]
Yeah
I kick out the door, yeah, I kick out the door (door)
Go grab the mic and I let out the sore (sore)
This my fanmail, wanna give out my heart (heart)
This an archive, I just record the flow (flow)
Come to my studio, magic happens (yeah)
Two step chillin', this feels classic
Ain't no job with no stress, no pressin'
So, baby, let's go, seatbelts are fastened
반딧불 같은 flashin' lights
우릴 스쳐가는 flashin' nights
꼭 아파야 해 그냥은 안 돼
시간이 지나면 웃겠지만
뭔가 보일 때까지 일단 걍 달려 (달려)
괜찮아, 내 수고는 내가 알어 (알어)
We keep ridin' the whole night, hol' on tight, yeah
We keep all the party in the room all night
We don't wanna put it on the brake, hold tight
해 뜰 때까지 더 계속해 all night
영감아, 기다려, 널 잡을게, all mine (yah)
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
I still have a dream 여전히 작업실
지나가는 사람에게 물어봐 1타 가수 누군지
코 앞이잖아, 그래미, this is for real
TV 나와 하는 돈 자랑들은 이젠 그냥 귀엽지
가끔씩 이 모든 게 꿈은 아닌가 싶어
해가 뜨기 전 어둠은 꽤나 짙어
때론 네가 걷던 길 위엔 시기와 시비가
앞서 걷던 사람들의 발자국 보다 훨씬 더 (oh, yeah)
Ayy, 많을 수 있다는 사실만 넌 알아둬
Ayy, 이제 선택은 네 몫이야, what you gonna do? (Uh-huh)
Ayy, yeah, she calls me charming, need an Army
Marching for your love, I'm a sergeant
I'm not from this planet, a martian
For you, I go the hardest
Can't stop when you get me started
You gonna make me park the Aston Martin
Tints on the windows, I don't do no talking
Oh, girl, I told you from the go
I need you to stay with me, loyal and faithfully
Ever so gracefully touching my soul
I know that you pray for me, trying to make a way for me
Girl, you know, I'ma always hold you close
Never let go, nope, you
Never let go, uh-uh, of you
All or nothing for ya love, I'ma risk it all
If it's not your name coming up on my phone
I won't pick up the call, not at all
Love the way you take it off, on my rocket you taking off
Yeah, we done got love involved, love involved
We keep all the party in this room all night
We don't wanna put it on the brake, hold tight
해 뜰 때까지 더 계속해 all night
영감아, 기다려, 널 잡을게, all mine
We keep all the party in the room all night
We don't wanna put it on the brake, hold tight
해 뜰 때까지 더 계속해 all night
영감아, 기다려, 널 잡을게, all mine
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all nights
