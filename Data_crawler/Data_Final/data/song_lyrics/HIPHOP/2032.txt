Song Name: No Limit
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, fuck with me and get some money (Yeah, ayy)
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with G and get some money
No limit, I'm a fucking soldier, ayy
Always lit, yeah, I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rock, she act like it's a boulder, ayy
'Rari, shopping, let me, cop it
Always, poppin', hella, poppin'
She's a bopper, homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping, album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to fuck around and call Kamaiyah
Hoe stirring up the pot, jambalaya (Young Gerald)
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money
I need tongue, I need face
Give me brain, concentrate
Apple phone, Prada case
Kill a weave, rock a lace
Fuck the Moet, buy the ACE
Fuck the Ghost, drive a Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie
Fuck the Rollie, Patek face
My career takin' off
These hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth
How these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs?
Bitch I ain't Jared
If you really want some smoke
You can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Saz√≥n
I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club 'til the end, from the start
You know me, Cardi B
Pussy poppin' on the charts, ah, ah
If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
In your face, what'd you say? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, fuck with me and get some money, yeah ayy
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with G and get some money
Yeah it ain't nice fam
You could study where I'm from on my Viceland
This is nothing new to me, this my life fam
I can pull a million girls from my mic stand
Pull one at my show 'cause I like fans
Later on I got two in my night plans
Man this year I got three hundred one night stands
Keep a Costco pack of rubbers in my night stand
Damn Daniel, back again with the, hah, Saint Laurent
Ayy, they send me product, yeah it's retarded
Ayy, this is free, ayy, bitch you brought it
Bitch you on my dick, ayy, bitch get off it
If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her (I like her)
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her (Wife her)
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
In your face, what'd you say? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, fuck with me and get some money, yeah ayy
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with me and get some money (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck with G and get some money
