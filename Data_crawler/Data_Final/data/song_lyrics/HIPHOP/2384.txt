Song Name: PILL BREAKER (feat. blackbear & Machine Gun Kelly)
Yeah
Even when I'm not around
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
When you feel down
When you feel down (down)
When you feel down (down)
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
I just put my heart up on my sleeve, make it fashion
I just checked up on my ex, still cappin'
What happened? Put you in the past but the pain is everlastin'
We just split a Xanny, everything was moving fast
But now it's kinda slow
Sit you in this drop, girl, we gotta go
Blurry lights, I'm going 'round the turns
Lipstick stains on my Margiela shirt
Pill you up with love, anything you need
This that type of shit that make my legs fall asleep
Always leaving, always in a rush
City sleeping, I'll be staying up 'cause
Even when I'm not around
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
When you feel down
When you feel down (down)
When you feel down (down)
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
It's purple in my 7UP
I'm hurting, this is not enough (hurting, I can't fix it, oh)
I ate a Percocet for lunch (pop that perky, yeah)
I'm in Heaven off this angel dust
I woke up in a red room, she did a white line
I'm in a dark place, I'm in the spotlight
Long sleeves cover the scars, dark circles under my eyes, yeah
I'm faded, it's late and I'm still awake, trying to find help
Told her, "I'll kill everybody you love, just so that I can have you to myself"
Even when I'm not around
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
When you feel down
When you feel down (down)
When you feel down (down)
Until the day we drown
Said I'll pill you up with love when you feel down
