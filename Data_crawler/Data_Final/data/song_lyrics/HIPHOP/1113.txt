Song Name: 2AM
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some
Go run it back and tell the news, news, news
Lil' buddy mad I got it lose or somethin'
Pulled up, or are you way too cool?
You in the house gettin' loose or somethin'
Drive me under (yeah), leave me wonderin' (yeah)
Flight to London, oh, yeah
Drive me under, make me wonder
Flight to London, oh, yeah
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some'
I just spent three long summers
Tryna get you back in the house, girl, cuddle (girl, cuddle)
Tryna get you back in the house for the double up (double up)
Hit you from the back watch how that booty bubble up
Yeah, best friend watch me juggle her, baddie
Get in the bed, baby, snuggle up I'm, daddy
Ride around fully loaded and it's automatic (fully loaded)
You should see the catty skrrt, it got a fatty
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some'
Two to the head, two shots too wild
To get you out your situation, situation
Two to the head, two shots too wild
To get you out your situation, your situation
Two in the morning, okay
