Song Name: Hear Me Calling
Ring, do you hear me callin'?
Purps On The Beat
Me no want no drama
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling
Break away and make a way to make it
Love the way you looking when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
Gots to be jokin'
Where in the fuck did you think you were goin'?
Folding and packing your clothes
Like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
A wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sipping, beautiful
Heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know
Let me in your heart
Don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
Inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
Inside my head, yeah
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling
You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in L.A. like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo' truck
You start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the Mansion
Take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tasting it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feeling
Yes, girl you the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling (darling)
Ring, do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
