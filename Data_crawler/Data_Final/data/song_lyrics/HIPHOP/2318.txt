I'm Like Damn Okay bitch
You could breathe but you can't text me back
Aye
Ho I'm Justin with the vibes I'm bringing sexy back
Yea

Aye
Yeah my mama was a crip but she not handicap
Walk around with fire she arson
Stealing food out the market
Now my pocket's fat as Cartman
Like a grownup saying sit down!
A brand new Wraith I park it
Made it out of them Apartments
All the way down to red carpets
Ashurp

Ain't no bitch without a dad
Finna tell me what a real man is

Got to get a check
Like I'm out here Burning
Got to get the earnings
Early in the morning
One thing about the tables
Little bitch it Keep turning
Fire in a crib Mississippi burning
Drop one of mine refund returning
Turn 'em into food if the pot keep stirring
You don't know enough. Little bitch. Keep learning
Being that broke out here is concerning
Niggas think they camouflage, but they tanking
GTA and real life. I play with Franklins
Face card valid in my city check my ranking
Niggas say they gang gang, but they ain't in
I got two hoes with me. One's a lint licker
The booty club don't give advice, but I big tipper
Her body is a work or art you get the big picture
Sending mix signal's no off a mixed Liquor
You fuck with me you going to be mad
High Key
I'll leave you like your dad
High key
Usher son I got it Bad
High Key
You bitch made you a drag
I See
Ridin Thru the city with a Blower
Ha Ha
Just came off a 50-city tour
Ha Ha
Used to be my bitch but not more
Ha Ha
Tradelines we finally up the score
Ha Ha
You Prepared to die for that pussy

So get the fuck up outta here
Fuck you
Fuck You Child Nigga
I'll bury you & that motherfucker
Now what you want to do about it
I'm Wit it nigga
I'm a goon
I'll blow the whole house down with a forty
Little bitch Don't play with the big bad wolf
Feeling kind of stingy today Don't play with your life
Little bitch You could get that took
God like walk around with my hair Like wool
Break bread Gotta make sure everybody full
Jordan the wizard Cuz I ain't with the bull
Top dog Great Dane Rotwilder Pit Bull
These days I got the whole hood watching me like a boot leg DVD
These days all my diamonds dance on me Like I got a PPP
Stretch the truth You see the reach
They selling dreams Well bring receipts
I ain't injured but I don't compete
They flip flop You see defeat
Its charity I feed the streets
I'm gone fuck your bitch
We can be friends after
Let's keep it a thou wow
I'm the grand master
I ain't never save no bitch
I'm Never playing pastor
Stop saying you from LA
If you from Lancaster
Perfidious words
You ain't outside like a curb
Aye
You niggas is nerds You only outside in the burbs
We finally purge
Since somebody gave you nerve
You either die and You burn
Or you could live and you learn
