Song Name: Please
Okay Joel, that's fire
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shxrkz
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
I feel we might've lost our touch
Tomorrow can't come sooner (Yeah), healing won't be fast enough
Keep her or remove her
I can't make the choice alone, we always stayed together
Oh, sometimes I wish I never met her
But we both know that's a lie
Hard to leave it all behind
To me it feels alive, this big ass thorn stuck in my side
I know that I could give into my pride at any second, any time
Girl, this life I'd leave behind but I know you don't care to try
Mine, taking back what's mine
Over all, this talk about our best nights
Your voice leaves me wrecked, like
I don't got none left in me
You've stuck through all our bad fights
Tell it to me straight that I'm the worst
But we're the best right now
We've been falling out
Fast forward
Searchin' in the crowd, I saw your face and I freaked out
Last time was bad, but I know that this ain't our last round
When you're comin' down
Turn this shit up loud, yeah
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
Passed out, my new life is fast now
Don't think I can catch up, my loves way back in the past now
Better then without a doubt, if I could bring you with somehow
Then maybe we could try it out, for once we could forget about it all
Please don't let me fall
Hold on tight once, please don't let this be the final call
Runnin' my mind out this time
Runnin' my mind out this time
Over all the countless lies
Wanna get you out my life
Divided, we don't stand a chance, against ourselves, I mean it
Takin' shots for you, girl, I wish you would stop the bleedin'
Can't you see, open your eyes
Can't you see, wanna stay blind?
Can't you see that you're the one that I wanna keep?
Over the love, I'm done, I'm on my own for once
Said you would try again, that I'm your number one
You can't bring me no more
Love ain't for free no more
You ain't for me no more
Gave up once or twice, but know I tried
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
I took a perc and hit my knees, my knees, my knees
Life costs a price and deaths for free, for free, for free
Life is a test, I guess we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please, I'm beggin' you, please
