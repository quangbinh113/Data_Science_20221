Song Name: From Now On (feat. Future)
Yeah
FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo t-shirts
Put that shit on, everyday from now on
Switching up my image, no more pictures with my styrofoam
Why the fuck I keep buying these houses if I'm never home?
I'm with gang, they never wrong
Supermodels, I'm stepping on 'em
Search for 'em, my weapon on 'em
Buy three, four bags in one time
Treat the condo like a trap house
Other spot, a baby compound
Bad bitches getting the run-around
Bruh a trackstar, he run shit down
I made this shit half of a one pound
I told bro dem one band one sound
She like, "Fuck the club, let's stay in"
'Cause she gotta get new tape in
My pockets too big, they could never belittle me
Bae, I'm a hell of a nigga, ain't wit the arguing
What's your dilemma
I buy her Kelly's, the real one
How you the hero but stay with some villains?
I ain't gone switch on my niggas dem
I run the game like I'm born with the ball
Youngin' ain't corny at all
Five foot nine, but I ain't that small, feel like I'm seven feet tall
Bro ain't stop, he just on pause, he comin' trim when I call him
FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo t-shirts
Put that shit on everyday from now on (Pluto)
Millions of dollars, walking in Prada, drinking out of sty-ro-foam (Pluto)
Gotta talk in code when you on FaceTime, like the feds on the phone (oh)
Live a billionaire lifestyle, but I still get bricks to ya door
Lil' one got the stick, ready to go blitz, lil' one stay on go
Flatline a nigga, one car, pull the pounds up in U-Hauls (Whew)
Dodging a life sentence and popping all this shit I talk
I done piped up another nigga-bitch, I'm too rich, my fault
I just alley-ooped a hoe to my dawg, he just slam dunked her (a hundred)
Balling like 'Bron, but now I'm starting to feel like messiah ('siah)
Codeine drinking, but I swear the money get me higher (higher)
Bitch told the judge I'm on pills, my mansion got marbles (marbles)
Charge a M for a show, still a serve a bell to you tomorrow
FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo t-shirts
Put that shit on everyday from now on
Everybody can fold but I won't, everybody want it but I don't
I make niggas follow and I lead, I make bitches cum, and I leave
Virgil Maybach it's so sweet, we just get 'em, ain't no beef
You can get her back, I can't keep her
We be getting "shh", that's our secret
Rappers wanna kick it, can't reach
You and five of y'all niggas can't see me
Really straight to war, nigga can't beat me
Akademiks know he ain't as rich as me
Brodie ready to eat for a twenty piece
I ain't got nothin' to say to you mini-me's
Ready to buy a lil' nigga contract
Yeah-yeah, whatever, we on that
Disappeared on them, they got weird on me
I'm the fall back king, number one shit
Me and King Pluto, that's a smooth tag team
Gotta live with it, can't wake up from it, this is not a bad dream
Look how life changed, TVs in the shower, used to steal flat screens
Shh, I know that they listening, fuck 'em
Know not to ask me about nothing
If I ain't somewhere getting money then I'm fucking
Fdrtt Fdrtt
That's that switch sound
I ain't going out without a fight, I'm telling you that shit now
Whatever I get, I'mma share with my brother
That's how we get down
If you get offended, it is what it is
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta so I gotta slick mouth
