Song Name: Fly Sh!t
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride in the foreign, my trunk in the front
Neck, wrist bustin', it look like a blunt
Shut down the mall, get whatever I want
Ten racks for a fit, only wear that shit once
Two-tone Cullinan truck, yeah
Feelin' like Giannis, I get bucks
We really runnin' it up
Bitch, don't spill what's in my cup (yeah)
It's goin' down, I'm goin' down, yeah
Gotta get you in my bedroom, need that shit right now
It's goin' down, I'm goin' down
I'ma make you feel special, let me show you how (yeah, yeah)
Only fly shit, wake up, make deposits (yeah)
Hot topic, they know I got options
Only fly shit, wake up, make deposits (yeah)
Hot topic (yeah), they know I got options (yeah, yeah)
This Audemar, my diamonds pink
I spent one-eighty, this shit crazy
VVS, bitch, no fugazzi
Since a kid, it's been, "Fuck you, pay me"
Ace of Spades, get wasted, uh
She say, "Lil' bae, you my favorite"
Gucci heels, I'm such a lady
Vintage CC from the '80s (yeah)
Ain't shit basic, they want me
They send me cases, sit on my neck
To the block, some basement, Off-White brand
In quotations, "R.I.P Virgil"
Two-tone Cullinan truck, yeah
Feelin' like Giannis, I get bucks
We really runnin' it up
Bitch, don't spill what's in my cup (yeah)
It's goin' down, I'm goin' down, yeah
Gotta get you in my bedroom, need that shit right now
It's goin' down, I'm goin' down
I'ma make you feel special, let me show you how (yeah, yeah)
Only fly shit, wake up, make deposits (yeah)
Hot topic, they know I got options
Only fly shit, wake up, make deposits (yeah)
Hot topic (yeah), they know I got options (yeah, yeah)
Ride in the foreign, my trunk in the front
Neck, wrist bustin', it look like a blunt
Shut down the mall, get whatever I want
Ten racks for a fit, only wear that shit once
Two-tone Cullinan truck, yeah
Feelin' like Giannis, I get bucks
We really runnin' it up
Bitch, don't spill what's in my cup
