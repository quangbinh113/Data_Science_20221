Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm in my bag (yeah)
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag (yeah)
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag (yeah)
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, yeah, bag a big bag
Yeah, nigga, I got a real-real addiction for this cash (yeah, nigga)
I got a real ambition for this cash (yeah)
13 years old with a shoebox stash, yeah
I'm always up to something, never sitting on my ass
Nigga, this Glizzock got my skinny's sagging
Nigga, I tote that Glizzock with a passion (baow)
Nigga, I tote that Glizzock with a passion (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I talk a whole lotta shit 'cause I can bag it
Up, up, yeah, it's up there
Bitch, my heart cold (yeah), my last name Moncler
My pockets fat swole, no, I don't eat pears
And trapping ain't dead (what?) These niggas just queers
I'm sipping color purple syrup, balling hard just like the beard (swoosh)
Yeah, and Larry Bird, I'm shooting shit, I know you heard
Ten toes, never in no hurry, nigga, I call shots, you heard?
Money talking, what's the word? (Brrt, huh, what's up?)
Ayy, I pray, but don't go to church
Don't ask me to split a verse
Can't trust no hoe, that's devil work
Yeah, I know the devil work (I know)
And I know that nobody's perfect
Still can't trust a bitch, for certain, hmm
For real though (the fuck?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm in my bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, yeah, bag a big bag
Yeah, nigga, I got a real-real addiction for this cash (yeah, nigga)
I got a real ambition for this cash, yeah
13 years old with a shoebox stash, yeah
I'm always up to something, never sitting on my ass
Yeah, nigga, I got a real-real addiction for this cash (yeah)
I got a real ambition for this cash, yeah
13 years old with a shoebox stash, yeah
I'm always up to something, never sitting on my ass (the fuck?)
Nigga, yeah
