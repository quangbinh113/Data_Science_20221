Song Name: While I'm Here (feat. Polo G)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Seph got the waves
Othello on the, Othello on the
Now this shit deeper than me, but we can talk about my past
Box out with that glizzy, 'cause they know Loaded down to crash
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
They gon' love you when you dead, I don't think that's overstated
I know that I'm the man, I don't think I'm overrated
Got sad when they said, "Boy, your granny ain't gon' make it"
Got mad when they said, "Your bro under old white blanket"
I spin for that man, I left a couple niggas stankin'
Hе kept that shit a band, told me, "Niggas hella janky"
And now that I got bands, I got hеlla niggas fakin'
I'm quick to let it blam, if this shit start lookin' janky
I know that I'm the man, yeah, I know they can't replace me
He reachin' for my chain, I take a risk (bitch, I kill)
'Cause on my chain it sit a couple hundred bricks
And if he played then he get hit up with the blick
Now this shit deeper than me, but we can talk about my past
Box out with that glizzy, 'cause they know Loaded down to crash
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
I'm from Chiraq, the streets'll spark, no we don't pay the hitters
Don't give no fuck, they send slugs through the bravest niggas
Where single moms have it hard, tryna raise a killer
Felt so much pain, keep takin' drugs 'til I can't remember
It can be your right hand mans, you never know
Dealin' with these deaths, keep takin' xans just to cope
Clutchin' on this chopper, I know you reap what you sow
Got me ridin' with this Drac' like I'm signed to OVO
My hood lookin' up to me like I'm they only hope
No soldiers left behind, so I keep all my homies close
All you see is blood when them demons get provoked
Quick to leave a nigga on that pavement dyin' slow
Now this shit deeper than me, but we can talk about my past
Box out with that glizzy, 'cause they know Loaded down to crash
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
I've seen my momma cry, that shit turned me to a demon
A nigga disrespect me, blam him, ain't no way I mean it
I know they want me dead, then can keep on dreamin'
My driver got a strap, nigga, ain't no double teamin'
Diamonds 'round my neck, you can see I glisten and gleanin'
Fell in love with sex, you got a friend, who you bringin'?
If they drop the window, I'ma go out squeezin'
Hit him in his body, now that boy been wheezin'
No police behind me, bustdown cuban got me freezin'
Ice on in the winter, I done over-froze the season
I really come from nothin', now my income really leadin'
This young nigga took off, and now they tryna find a reason
Now this shit deeper than me, but we can talk about my past
Box out with that glizzy, 'cause they know Loaded down to crash
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead
Show love while I'm here, don't wait until I'm dead (don't wait)
