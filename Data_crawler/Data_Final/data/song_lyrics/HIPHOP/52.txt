Song Name: Lit Right Now
Ayy, Mateo, man, wake up man, c'mon
You over there sleep, boy, I'm lit right now, man, get up!
What?
Get up!
What?
Boy, get up because
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
I'm so lit right now, your life is so borin', ayy
Why y'all sleepin' on me? I can hear you snorin', ayy
I'm so lit right now, my diamonds on that wet-wet
Makin' hits right now, I swear we up next-next
Lit up in France, and in Europe
Countin' big bands on the tour bus
All the girls go crazy off that reverse
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
They say, "Ayo, why you always wearing Bape man?"
Call up big ape 'cause I'm little ape man
Boppin' multiply by three times eight man
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
They say, "Teo, why Medusa all up on you?"
In Barbados eating sushi like I'm Kung Fu
Thought I couldn't do it well, I guess I fooled you
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
For my real bros, we up next, yeah
I rock real gold on my neck, yeah
We got real goals, let's get a check, yeah
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
I'm so lit right now, your life is so borin', ayy
Why y'all sleepin' on me? I can hear you snorin', ayy
I'm so lit right now, my diamonds on that (wet-wet)
Makin' hits right now, I swear we up next-next
Lit up in France, and in Europe
Countin' big bands on the tour bus
All the girls go crazy off that reverse
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
Hop up in the Jag', flexin' on my haters
Diamonds from France plus all my meals catered
I like my foreign women, all flavors
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah-yeah) I'm so lit right now
Brrrt, brrrt, brrrt, please don't call right now (please don't call me)
Brrrt, brrrt, brrrt, I'm with your chick right now
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
We so lit, whip like this
We so lit, drop like this
We so lit, we so lit
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
I'm so lit right now, your life is so borin', ayy
Why y'all sleepin' on me? I can hear you snorin', ayy
I'm so lit right now, my diamonds on that wet-what?
Makin' hits right now, I swear we up next-next
Lit up in France, and in Europe
Countin' big bands on the tour bus
All the girls go crazy (we lit!) off that reverse
I'm so lit right now
Okay, okay, okay, ugh!
