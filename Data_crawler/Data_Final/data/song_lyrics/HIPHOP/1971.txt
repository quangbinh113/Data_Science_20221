Song Name: Breathe
Breathe, oh
Woo, woo, woo
Breathe
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta
Then you gotta
Yo, these niggas can't breathe when I come through
Hum too, some shoes, gotta be twenty man
It's not even funny they can't (Breathe)
The chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right
You know what? You right
These bitches can't (Breathe)
Look look, they hearts racin', they start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past, that they can't (Breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than your past
If you present with the man, you better (Breathe)
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm gettin' better year by year
Like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K-9s through
And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep 'em on a diet
Embrace they health or either keep 'em on the quiet
And space myself
And just take a deep breath
I got 'em grabbin' they chest
'Cause it's hurtin' 'em to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just layin' a verse, I'm sayin' the facts
I came back with some sicker ston
That got these broke niggas lookin' at me
Like they chokin' on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone
Breathe
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta
Then you gotta
Yo, these niggas can't breathe when I come through
Hum too, some shoes, gotta be twenty man
It's not even funny they can't (Breathe)
The chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right
You know what? You right
These bitches can't (Breathe)
Look look, they hearts racin', they start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past, that they can't (Breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than your past
If you present with the man, you better (Breathe)
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (Breathe)
But I keep the Glocks in the stashes
'Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (Breathe)
They has to react, like having an asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at 90
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on 'em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it 'til your face get blue
And then (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta
Then you gotta
Yo, these niggas can't (Breathe)
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef', only way you catch an F
To the A-B, it's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Grippin' on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya
They gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop 'til they inhale your seed
And it don't stop 'til I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers (Breathe)
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta
Queens gotta (Breathe)
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody (Breathe)
One and then the two (Two)
Two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four)
Then you gotta (Breathe)
Then you gotta
Then you gotta
Breathe
