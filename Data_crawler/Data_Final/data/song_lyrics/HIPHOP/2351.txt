Song Name: Big League (with Yo Gotti, Moneybagg Yo, CMG The Label feat. Mozzy & Lil Poppa)
Hey, if you don't make it, you just don't make it
Everybody ain't champions
But I am, ha-ha
(Murda on the beat, so it's not nice)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)
Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, Swish cheese (Swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
Onе step closer to the big ring
Court-sidе seats so close, I could triple-referee (ha-ha)
Send to drop the fire, and one, that's three (go)
The reason y'all losing, you don't speak no D (no)
So we ain't gotta play team ball, that's Keith (sure)
Been won a championship in the trap
This Rollie a trophy, I hold it up (got me one)
They let us get up with no points, it's a wrap
Gon' shine every time, it's an open look (over with)
Ah, ah, shake 'em up, cross 'em up, post-move
Defense lock 'em up, fah, fah
Ain't nobody hot as us (pump fake)
Shooter getting added up
24 pointers and the AP shot-clock
Damn, what them rocks in your ear cost? (A lot)
On the grind, don't stop, one day it's gon' pay off (pay off)
Made it from the bottom to the play-offs
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)
Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, Swish cheese (Swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
One step closer to the big ring
Court-side seats, this the big bag
Hit a Ja Morant shot, get 'em big mad
Real hustle, knew one day it was gon' pay off, pay off
Yeah, now I'm balling in the play-offs, play-offs
Mansion in Miami, ball at the Celtics
"Gotti, you the entree", yeah, I nailed it
Bought a Rolls Royce on Lamb', they mailed it
No look, pass to the 'Bagg, how you fail that?
Ah, ah, shake 'em up, cross 'em up, post-move
Defense lock 'em up, fah, fah
Ain't nobody hot as us (pump fake)
Shooter getting added up, ah, ah
Shot-clock 'posed to be the Lambo
Two-seater, we don't do new people (fah, fah)
Feds break, take it off, lose one
Shake it off, bounce back, then defeat 'em
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)
Like the '02 Lakers, I three-peat (I three-peat)
That mean we don't ever lose, we repeat (what's that?)
Yeah, they hate, but they really wanna be me (wanna be us)
Bet they do a no-look when they see me (when they see us)
Grab the 12 like Ja, I'm a Grizzly (I'm a Grizzly)
Think I'ma fall when I ball, he silly (you crazy)
I might trade all my pendants, ayy (what?)
Ayy, last name James, but my first name Mike (first name Mike)
Playtime over, this the tip-off
They tried to cross me and spit ball
No logger team, he got kicked off
Threw up the alley and watch how I lift off
We got 'em pissed off, look at the score
No Michael Jordan, we in Dior
Bet on the Warriors when they hit the floor
Yeah, get your ligaments torn
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)
Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, Swish cheese (Swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
One step closer to the big ring
Playtime over, this the big ring (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, need a big ring (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, need a big ring (G.O.A.T.)
Playtime over, this the big wing (G.O.A.T.)
