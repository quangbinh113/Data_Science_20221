Long live my brother Dave, he ain't make it home, mmm
She be all on me like she need me

New suit, yeah, big boss
I know I'm not hearin' not a young nigga sayin' none

Tryna get in her heart with no code
Tried leavin' the F-word alone
It ain't right how you usin' your tongue
Uh, made young nigga, I got mine, I ain't runnin', no

Million dollar business, I ain't never turn it down
