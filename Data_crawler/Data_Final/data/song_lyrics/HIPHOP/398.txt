Song Name: Ginger
Hey ok, just punch me in man
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him
Shawty got a iPhone X but she ain't in America
I don't wanna talk less baby girl lemme go and handle ya
Now she wanna hopscotch criss cross all the way to Panama
When I asked why shorty said it's because I'm a fan of ya
I said please don't take me on no date no no
Don't know why you feelin' some type of way no no
I got ginger in my tea, so I just stay up all the time
And she wanna talk to me, but I don't wanna talk tonight
I live two lives like I'm Hannah Montana man
My bitch so bad like she Princess Diana
I feeling like an animal, I'm dripping like a danimal
Two servings of my baby on the daily like a cannibal, what?
Cuz I'm formerly known as that nigga ATM
I'm feeling like the king I got a crown and a benz
And the bitches steady flocking said they placing their bets
On a nigga so picky only rocking with tens
Two milli all on my head and two of em just in the bed
Two of em watching and two of em talking like 2k they said the want next
I chase a bag and I run it up
She want me bad till the sun come up
I don't do talking but I keep a rocket
It's all on my body you know it's up
Money baby sexy ladies
Looking at me oh
I know they want me for forever
That's not how I roll
I take the top of the whip smoove
She give me top in the whip ooh
Here for a minute I'll dip when I finish
She texting me saying I miss you
I know why you want me now
But you weren't here when I was down
You wouldn't save me if I had drowned
You wanna use me wanna take my crown
Shawty got a iPhone X but she ain't in America
I don't wanna talk less baby girl lemme go and handle ya
Now she wanna hopscotch criss cross all the way to Panama
When I asked why shorty said it's because I'm a fan of ya
I said please don't take me on no date no no
Don't know why you feelin' some type of way no no
I got ginger in my tea, so I just stay up all the time
And she wanna talk to me, but I don't wanna talk tonight, yeah yeah yeah
