Song Name: Cry No More
Grrt, boom, boom
Lil Tjay
Oh, oh
Uh
Streets got 'em, ain't no saving them boys
Grandma tryna pray to the Lord
Raise hell if they take one of yours
My lil' shorty gon' slide when he bored
Lil' nigga off the porch tryna score
Took a loss and that hurt to the core
Don't matter how much drugs I did
How much weed I hit, how much lean I pour
I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Stood over bro on the floor dying
Thinking homicide, wasn't no crying
Hop out, glizzies, .40s, and four-fives
Looking for the killers, ain't no time
'Member we was drilling, oh, what a feeling
We ain't give a fuck about no time
That was before time, run on the opp, now it's your time
Clips is еxtended for showtime
Wokе up, hit bro line
Back out in traffic before nine
We load it up, went on both sides
It's different phases, I did it perfect, amazing
Been on them bitches with no minds
I saw 'em bail out, headshot four times
Baby mama fell on the floor crying
Went on a hit, had to look before firing
'Cause my auntie, she shot with they dope line
Lost too many niggas, when they died, I ain't even cry
I ain't even feel it, I can't even lie
Staying in my city, I might end up a homicide
Two gun cases 'cause I'm traumatized
Plus the police wanna kill a nigga, I wonder why
Bulletproof lack when I'm coming by
Ain't no saving them boys, I'ma still be the one to try
Hopefully, ain't gotta kill one of mine
Streets got 'em, ain't no saving them boys
Grandma tryna pray to the Lord
Raise hell if they take one of yours
My lil' shorty gon' slide when he bored
Lil' nigga off the porch tryna score
Took a loss and that hurt to the core
Don't matter how much drugs I did
How much weed I hit, how much lean I pour
I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no)
If he talking out his mouth, break his jaw
Mind fucked, for the fallen, I'ma pour
Pain runnin' through my body, can't ignore
Cold world got my heart so sore
I ain't tryna feel pain no more
Can't change, I'ma bang that four
What you tryna live the gang life for?
Don't cap if the lane not yours
I was a young nigga, misled every day, used to stay in the streets, huh
Hustling, I couldn't miss bread, run that bag every day of the week, huh
Nigga try me and get hit dead, all of my young niggas playing for keeps, huh
So you better off focusing instead, better not go that way, it get deep, huh
I'm smoking dummy, it's busting, this shit to the point that a nigga can't feel nothing
New opposition, I'm rushing, I told all my shooters like hawk and go kill something
I lost a couple of soldiers, I keep going over so now I don't feel nothing
Crying, I'm letting that steel drum
We gon' spin through the opps and they still run
Streets got 'em, ain't no saving them boys
Grandma tryna pray to the Lord
Raise hell if they take one of yours
My lil' shorty gon' slide when he bored
Lil' nigga off the porch tryna score
Took a loss and that hurt to the core
Don't matter how much drugs I did
How much weed I hit, how much lean I pour
I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no, no)
Uh, uh, I don't wanna cry no more (no, no)
