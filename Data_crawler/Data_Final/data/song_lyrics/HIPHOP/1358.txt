Song Name: In My Head
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like
Na-na-na-na, every day (Lil Tjay)
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I got some funny feelings in my head
And girl, I don't know what to call it (call)
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love
But I know that I want some more of it (more)
These feelings, been stuck in my head
Ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it (no)
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Fuck all them bitches, they ain't shit, they ignorin'
Daily you be on my mind
My heart hurt beat and bruised, from the owner before it
Got a good feelin' this time
I been focused on you, and I cannot ignore it
Better than all of them combined
Shit, nothin' better than callin' you mine
You a ten out of ten, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
Have you ever loved a gangster? (No)
Got a feelin' that you never did (nah)
It's a different type of love, different type of hug
Tryna catch it from a kid (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I can do mad stuff
And my background been past rough (rough)
Taking shots, got my glass up
My life started a disaster
Lately, minutes just been faster
Trench Kid preachin' like a pastor
You been on my mind, shit been out of line
Normally, I be on Casper
Normally, I keep it smooth
Call up Harvard like I'm a master
But it's somethin' about you
I can't see through, oh
I got some funny feelings in my head
And girl, I don't know what to call it (call)
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love
But I know that I want some more of it (more)
These feelings, been stuck in my head
Ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it (no)
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Fuck all them bitches, they ain't shit, they ignorin'
Daily you be on my mind
My heart hurt beat and bruised, from the owner before it
Got a good feelin' this time
I been focused on you, and I cannot ignore it
Better than all of them combined
Shit, nothin' better than callin' you mine
You a ten out of ten, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
Sidestep, that's my flex
And you gon' die if you keep tryna play games
All I know is treacherous, fuck around in straight flames
Hate pain, but it's all through my veins
Rollin' dope, it go straight to my mind
I can be feelin', I'm one of a kind
Can't no one hold me back?
How they gon' hold me back?
Destined to win, ain't no blockin' my shine
Took me a minute, I waited
Every year, shit get greater, I'm stuck in my prime
Still get better, it's way more than fine
I be the type to just say less and grind
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
