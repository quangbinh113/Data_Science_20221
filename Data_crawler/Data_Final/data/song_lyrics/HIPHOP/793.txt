Song Name: Rose Gold (feat. King Von)
Two-tone rose gold (rose gold), Cartier skeleton ('ton)
I ride with my dawgs, whether right or wrong (right or wrong)
I got all these scars 'cause my niggas gone (niggas gone)
Tat 'em on I'm back and put 'em in my songs

Caught him slippin', left him on the news
Gotta bite now 'cause he love to chew
All these hoes in here, I gotta fuck me one
New Lambo' with the trunk in the front
These niggas diabetic, they sweeter than punch
I done made it out the bottom, baby, I ain't goin' back
Maybach or that Lambo' truck
Revolver hit 'em, they ain't solvin' that
His and hers Chane'-ne' drip, too many Glocks they come with extensions (boom)
Whack all the opps, don't leave no witness (boom)
Poppin' all these Percs, I need to quit it
Cop brand new coupes and leave the ceilin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hop out the drop at the opp's spot and pop shots (grrr)
Young nigga worth some M's, it's crazy 'cause I also spin the block (skrr)
Bad lil' bitch want ass shots (ass shots)
I'ma cash her out, she gon' give me that drop (give me that drop)
That bitch think she special, I drop drip all on my bad thots
Lambo' seats in here (in here)
Stash spots, got the heat in here (in here)
Watch your body, they creepin', yeah
No peace, no sleep in here
Ayy, bro, just bring them freaks in here (in here)
If he's sweet, I'll have my young niggas eat
We gon' have a feast in here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Two-tone rose gold (rose gold), Cartier skeleton ('ton)
I ride with my dawgs whether right or wrong (right or wrong)
I got all these scars 'cause my niggas gone (because they gone)
Tat 'em on I'm back and put 'em in my songs (damn, huh? Gang)
Caught him slippin', left him on the news (boom)
Gotta bite now 'cause he love to chew (boom)
All these hoes in here, I gotta fuck me one
New Lambo' with the trunk in the front (huh, what?)
These niggas diabetic, they sweeter than punch (huh, huh, ooh-ooh, Von, Von)
Before I die they gon' remember me (they is)
For bein' in these streets and slangin' heat, ain't ducked no enemies (boom, boom)
I want the toughest nigga, I ain't never preyed upon the weak (yeah, yeah)
And yo' lil' baby momma lip real good but that bitch pussy weak (facts)
These lil' boys can't fuck with me (uh-uh)
4-5 Glocks, they stuck to me
I be in your dreams
You can't even sleep, if you think about touchin' me (huh, what?)
Man, this shit'll get ugly (it will), now this shit'll get brazy (on God)
Roy got killed, that made me crazy (yeah)
Couldn't do shit, I was in them cages (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fightin' murder ones (uh-huh), couldn't even see my son (I couldn't)
I was on the run, still tote a gun, revoked bond (what? What? Yeah)
Now I got the biggest bag (I do), you know these niggas mad (you know)
He tried to run off with that sack
I made him fumble then I ran it back (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Two-tone rose gold (rose gold), Cartier skeleton ('ton)
I ride with my dawgs, whether right or wrong (right or wrong)
I got all these scars 'cause my niggas gone (niggas gone)
Tat 'em on I'm back and put 'em in my songs
Caught him slippin', left him on the news
Gotta bite now 'cause he love to chew
All these hoes in here, I gotta fuck me one
New Lambo' with the trunk in the front
These niggas die better, they sweeter than punch (ooh-ooh)
Two-tone rose gold, Cartier skeleton
I ride with my dawgs whether right or wrong
I got all these scars 'cause my niggas gone
Tat 'em on I'm back and put 'em in my songs
