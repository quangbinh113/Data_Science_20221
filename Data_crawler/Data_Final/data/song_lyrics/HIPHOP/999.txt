Song Name: Sleeping With the Enemy (feat. S-X)
Sometimes I think this world's a simulation
The way that certain things just happen with no explanation
Just like the time I went to go to tell my mum I'm quitting school
She laughed at me and said that, "This is just an April Fool"
Sorry mum, but I'm for real (for real)
I'm done with living our poor life, there's just a bigger deal (deal)
I'm way too old for you to beat me (nah)
I just want you to treat me like a person with a choice (choice)
Now for my decisions, I'm a person with a voice
Now I'm hitting a wall
And it all comes apart
See a light in the dark
And it's blinding my eyes, oh
Now I feel like someone's watchin' me (yeah)
And someone else is watchin' them
And I'm sleepin' with the enemy, yeah
Acting like they were my friend
It's never easy on the road
Shut down many times, I've been alone
Cry, I'm fully grown
I'm overloaded with emotions
Overwhelming with emotions with a view
This is just a movie with a crew
I hate when overthinking makes me wanna find a new
Or when the people find a reason just to hate on you
I came with nothing on me, I'll leave with nothing on me
I guess the time that's in between is for the viewin' only
I know where they're hiding
It don't make me excited
I know that they won't like it
But I gotta break free
Now I'm hitting a wall (now I'm hitting a wall)
And it all comes apart (and it all comes apart)
See a light in the dark (see another light)
And it's blinding my eyes, oh (oh)
Now I feel like someone's watchin' me, yeah
And someone else is watchin' them
And I'm sleepin' with the enemy, yeah
Acting like they were my friends
