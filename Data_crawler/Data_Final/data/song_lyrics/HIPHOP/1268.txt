Song Name: is it you
Who am I?
Who are you?
Why you here tonight?
Another time, another place, layin' in the rain
And then the waves started crashing the walls in my mind
There's nothing left that I could do
So fuck a watch, fuck a chain, don't need none of that (I need you)
Found a bump, found a love, that brought me down inside
And then the walls started crashing, you can be replaced
Or maybe it's all in my head
'Cause you
You left me listening and you left me wondering
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And why
Am I still standing the same ground as you?
I don't know
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you?
She had my mind twisted up
Head spinnin'
I'm over my limit (yeah)
Watchin' the clock spinnin' (oh)
I lost all feeling
I'm finna wild out
I know we far from finished
We came too far to end it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Looking for some peace, don't know where to go
Praying for some peace, looking for some love
But I never can, 'cause it's hard to find
Oh, I wish there was a way that I could hit rewind
But I can't, 'cause I be running off of an empty tank
And I've seen enough to hurt me for eternity
Got no choice but to try and find another way
I know that there'll never be another way
Oh, oh, got me going down, down, down, down, down, down
Oh, oh, chains draggin' on the ground, ground, ground, ouuu
'Cause you
You left me listening and you left me wondering
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And why
Am I still standing the same ground as you?
I don't know, oh
Is it you?
Is it you?
