Song Name: Frio
Smokin' weed to Migos
It's just me and mi amigos (uh)
And we feelin' like gold
Woke up like CeeLo (yeah)
John Lennon shades
Mobbin' around like a Beatle (like a Beatle, yeah)
And I'm so cold, "hace frio"
Yeah, yeah, bling, bling, bling
My accountant called
Said I gotta be more accountable
I told 'em, that's cool
We can start when I get back from Monaco
Got a pool with the view and the scenery tropical
And I'm comin' back lookin' tan as fuck like a Navajo
Bling, bling, bling
They don't get the picture like they service sucks
Bet they hear me now, yeah they've heard of us
Hit the ground runnin', on my hurry up
Landed on the green first shot
This the birdie putt
And if you call me out, call an audible
And I'm rollin' up the tree like it's the pot of gold
Got a model thing that lick me like an envelope
Put her on the plane, I'm just sayin'
That's a lot of dough
Smokin' weed to Migos
It's just me and mi amigos (uh)
And we feelin' like gold
Woke up like CeeLo (yeah)
John Lennon shades
Mobbin' around like a Beatle (like a Beatle, yeah)
And I'm so cold, "hace frio"
Bling, bling, bling
It get chilly when you out here dog
Guess I needed this Gucci fur after all
Got my girl, the his and hers to top it off
And she's cool if we just kick it like a soccer mom
Got a flight up in the morning I ain't packin' for it
Got a meetin' with a suit but I ain't slackin' off
I don't even own a fuckin' pair of slacks at all
Talkin' M's in my F's dog saggin' off
I don't bend, I don't break
My life too real to be fake
I got no time to engage
In all the games that they play
'Cause it can change in a day
The only people that safe
The ones who ain't in my way
Now I'm doin' shit I promised I would never do
With some fake white chicks, feel like Terry Crews
Got a nice watch, so they watch my every move
Hit my phone but they ain't ever gettin' through
Smokin' weed to Migos
It's just me and mi amigos (uh)
And we feelin' like gold
Woke up like CeeLo (yeah)
John Lennon shades
Mobbin' around like a Beatle (like a Beatle, yeah)
And I'm so cold, "hace frio"
Bling, bling, bling
