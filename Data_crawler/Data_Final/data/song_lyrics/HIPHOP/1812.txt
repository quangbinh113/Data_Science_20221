Song Name: Vette Motors
Hit that light for me, let me roll this leaf
(Beezo need cash only, ya dig?)
(OG Parker)
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Uh, hmm, let's do it, huh
Bitch, I'm toxic, kickin' your shit, you better watch it, whoa, whoa
Just unzipped my pants, cash stuffed down all in my pockets (pockets)
Put her in Herm√®s, now I got all these niggas jockin'
My weight up and now I got the power
Tell 'em, "Lil' slime gon' spray on cowards"
Your ho in this bitch, it's a money shower
Starin' too hard, won't be my main
Drippin' sauce, won't give me brain
Paint that Maybach, pure cocaine
Fuck goin' on? They wan' do somethin', hold on, grr, grr
Cutlass, 'Vette motors inside my hood, yeah
Prince inside my hood, yeah, "Let's get this understood," I said (I said)
I be with the masked men and they all unheard of (unheard of)
One eighty-seven, just spent me a seven
Need Christian V steppin', they know it's a murder, this fit unheard of
Bad like her friend, huh, I see why that's her twin (her twin)
Four hoes at the Drury Inn, I got 'em in rotation (got 'em)
Once they leave, look like they soul taken
I got 'em, like, "Oh, baby" (oh, baby)
Chopper for chopper go dollar for dollar
I'm takin' the problems away from my mama
I turned up my sister, show love to my brother
I be liking all my stylists
Hold on, haircut fresh by stylist
Hold on, new coupe, ain't no mileage (huh?)
Bitch, I'm toxic, kickin' your shit, you better watch it
Crash out, turn up, bought that bitch that rock and told her
"It better not get shown once, ho" (better not)
Fill up a clip or go fill up a safe (buh, buh, buh, buh)
Fill up a clip or go fill up a safe (buh, buh, buh, buh)
Cross his chest, I spray that Drac'
Uh, uh, uh, uh, piss on somethin' with diamond chains
New machine (skrrt), count it up, nigga, yeah
Fuckin' with mathematics
Twenty million on thirty, not far from Cali'
Put her in Prada, I'm up in Valley
Let's do it, tote gun smoke, blow static, uh (brrt)
Fuck up the mattress, then fill up another one
Fuck on her, that Patek, I bought her another one
Kick my shit, I'm in this bitch, we're lit by three hoes (lit by, lit by)
Whip that Maybach in the street, cash out on three, let's go
Hypnotizin' yo' ho, we be turnin' her out
Do that dude sh-? I ain't runnin' my mouth
Which one you workin'? I'm clockin' it out
Startin' the Rolls from inside of the house
Cutlass, 'Vette motors inside my hood, yeah
Prince inside my hood, yeah, "Let's get this understood," I said (I said)
I be with the masked men and they all unheard of (unheard of)
One eighty-seven, just spent me a seven
Need Christian V steppin', they know it's a murder, this fit unheard of
She in with shottas, we pourin' up lines from out of the bottle (from out of the bottle)
My beanie Amiri, Giuseppe, I'm steppin', I locked in my stylist, I pay it (I pay it)
Treat my bitch like all new whips, that's upgrade models (upgrade models)
My bitch walk 'round with one milli', I say, "Yeah, yeah" (bitch, yeah)
Fill up a clip or go fill up a safe (fill up, buh, buh, buh)
Fill up a clip or go fill up a safe (brr, bop, bop, buh)
Cross his chest, I spray that Drac'
Uh, uh, uh, uh, piss on somethin' with diamond chains
My weight up and now I got the power
Tell 'em, lil' slime, "Gon' spray on cowards"
Your ho in this bitch, it's a money shower
Starin' too hard, won't be my main
Drippin' sauce, wan' give me brain
Paint that Maybach, pure cocaine
Fuck goin' on? They wan' do somethin', hold on, grr, grr, grr
