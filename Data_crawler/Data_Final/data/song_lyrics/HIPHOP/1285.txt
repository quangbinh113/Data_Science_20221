Song Name: Lurkin (feat. Polo G) - Remix
Haha, grr
Von, Von, Von (That hard, BMC)
Young nigga, 26, never had a job (huh?)
They never gave a nigga shit, so I had to rob
I was walkin' niggas down, they ain't have a car (yeah)
Too fast, I get on your ass, you ain't gettin' far (boom)
Too sad, he was talkin' bad, now he in the stars (boom)
Who is that? We don't give a fuck, he ain't one of ours
Switch the car, hit 'em high (woah), get caught, play it smart
Find you out, you will stop, hit the gas, livin' large (uh)
Damn, you know we ain't squashin' no beef (no beef)
My dawg got dumped in the middle of the road
We leavin' this shit in the streets (boom, boom)
Got some shorties outside and they lurkin' for me, uh (huh?)
They ain't lurkin' for free (yeah)
Got some shorties outside and they won't go to sleep
Huh, what? 'Cause this how they eat
Uh, young nigga, 22, ten M's up
2021 X7, fuck a Benz truck
24 shots in his FN tucked
Playing at the Heaven gates is where he gon' end up
If I'm comin' in your club, then I brought the Glock
Opps pull up, they won't make it out the parking lot
My lil' nigga keep shootin' 'til his target drop
Treat his head like a cig when we spark his top
I be feelin' like I'm still in the field
Pipe clutchin' while I'm whippin' the wheel
I can't tell my lil' hitters to chill
I'm from the 'Raq, where the killers get killed
Like, "Where he at?" Now his shit gettin' spilled
This is all facts, shit I'm spittin' is real
Ain't no drive-bys, walkin' up on the drill
Charged for a homicide, prayin' for an appeal
Was broke, stuck in the hood, now I live in the hills
(Now I live in the hills)
Damn, you know we ain't squashin' no beef (no beef)
My dawg got dumped in the middle of the road
We leavin' this shit in the streets (boom, boom)
Got some shorties outside and they lurkin' for me, uh (huh?)
They ain't lurkin' for free (yeah)
Got some shorties outside and they won't go to sleep
Huh, what? 'Cause this how they eat
But lately, I been tryna be cool (cool)
'Cause I know the kids, they watch what I do (damn)
And I know the feds, they watchin' me too (huh?)
But niggas ain't stoppin' me, I'm sendin' this bitch to the moon
We shoot them boys fast, say, "Give 'em a broom" (damn)
This one for Patoon (boom)
If you ain't seen his ass, you'll see him at noon (uh-huh, what?)
Put him on the news (boom, boom)
This how it go (you know how it go)
Better keep your pole (better keep your pole)
Better not move slow (not move slow)
Boys on a roll (them boys on a)
Them boys tried to score (them boys tried to score)
Boys ain't gon' go (boys ain't gon' go)
That boy ain't no ho (that boy ain't no ho)
I'm lettin' you know, I'm lettin' you know
Damn, you know we ain't squashin' no beef (no beef)
My dawg got dumped in the middle of the road
We leavin' this shit in the streets (boom, boom)
Got some shorties outside and they lurkin' for me, uh (huh?)
They ain't lurkin' for free (yeah)
Got some shorties outside and they won't go to sleep
Huh, what? 'Cause this how they eat
