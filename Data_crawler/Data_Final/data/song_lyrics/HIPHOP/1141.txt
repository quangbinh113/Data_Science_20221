Song Name: Already Dead
You can see the pain in my laugh (yeah, yeah)
Demons coming back from the past (yeah, yeah)
Feeling like I'm 'bout to relapse (yeah, yeah)
Voices in my head (yeah, yeah)
All I can hear them say (yeah, yeah)
Is everyone wants me dead (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm already dead (yeah, yeah)
I've been dead for years
I've been taking medicine again (yeah, yeah)
Henny, mix it with the Vicodin (yeah, yeah)
All my suffering (yeah)
Is really getting under my skin (yeah)
Maybe I should try to pray again (yeah, yeah)
Try to wash away my sins (yeah, yeah)
I know that they not my friends (yeah, yeah)
But I'm friends with the drugs again (yeah)
Lost my heart, lost it all
So much drama, hold the applause
Shit's like a soap opera, straight downfalls
Nightmares on the cellphone, late-night calls
Lost my heart, lost it all
So much drama, hold the applause
No soap opera, straight downfalls
Listen to the nightmares call
You can see the pain in my laugh (yeah, yeah)
Demons coming back from the past (yeah, yeah)
Feeling like I'm 'bout to relapse (yeah, yeah)
Voices in my head (yeah, yeah)
All I can hear them say (yeah, yeah)
Is everyone wants me dead (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm already dead (yeah, yeah)
I've been dead for years
You can see the pain in my laugh (yeah, yeah)
Demons coming back from the past (yeah, yeah)
Feeling like I'm 'bout to relapse (yeah, yeah)
Voices in my head (yeah, yeah)
All I can hear them say (yeah, yeah)
Is everyone wants me dead (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm already dead (yeah, yeah)
I've been dead for years (yeah)
Have you ever been so alone? (Yeah, yeah)
That nobody's house feels like home (yeah, yeah)
I've been running out of drugs and hope (yeah, yeah)
I don't even got a plug no more (yeah, yeah)
Have you ever been so alone? (Yeah, yeah)
That you don't know what to feel no more? (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no reaching for the pills no more (yeah, yeah)
One more and you're on the floor (yeah, yeah)
I know that I didn't stand a chance (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't think I'll ever live again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm only here by popular demand (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm staying alive for the fans (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost my heart, lost it all
So much drama, hold the applause
No soap opera, straight downfalls
Listen to the nightmares call
You can see the pain in my laugh (yeah, yeah)
Demons coming back from the past (yeah, yeah)
Feeling like I'm 'bout to relapse (yeah, yeah)
Voices in my head (yeah, yeah)
All I can hear them say (yeah, yeah)
Is everyone wants me dead (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm already dead (yeah, yeah)
I've been dead for years (yeah, yeah)
You can see the pain in my laugh (laugh)
Demons coming back from the past (from the past)
Feeling like I'm 'bout to relapse (relapse)
Voices in my head (in my head)
All I can hear them say (all I can hear them say)
Is everyone wants me dead (is everyone wants me dead)
Bitch, I'm already dead (bitch, I'm already dead)
I've been dead for years (I've been dead for years)
