Frank White, god body
Teflon John Gotti
Dope boy, Illuminati
Slick Rick with the jewels
It's the show, la di da di
Got nothing else to prove
Shit, I still catch a body
Wanna walk through my lobby?
Get a brick from me prolly
It's a hunnid on a dolly
Willy Wonka to you Charlies
I'm the soul and the spirit
Cocaine's Bob Marley
Dope boy don't retire
Bad bitches won't allow me
All my rebels like Rowdy
All my guns is like Saudis
Four albums, four rings
Still could never do an Audi
All my diamonds so clear
But my kitchen still cloudy
Always had the best numbers
I just waited 'til they found me

You talkin' to that Rollie-wearin', God-fearin'
Cuban link, nine-car, paper tag
Mr. take-your-bitch-and-give-her-back
I ain't tryna brag but a nigga bag it's different
I'm the big-ticket, huh
You got a Benz and I got a Benz but they know the difference, huh
Tell Pedro to send it
Throw a Michael Redd I'ma sell a bag for this Scottie Pippen
Yeah, that's chicken
Eleven points like I'm Kyrie
Who scared? Nigga, not me
Young humble mixed with cocky
I know my young boys got me
I'm up next, nigga, watch me
Try warring with my posse
Move, groove, when you see me better "Woo"
