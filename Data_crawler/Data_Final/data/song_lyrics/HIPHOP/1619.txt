Song Name: Scenario
Traphouse Mob
Uh
Shout out my fifty clock n-, my hundred clock n-
Big 092MLBOA 'til they switch, uh
FTO sh-, free Jeezy, free Clutch, free Melly Gs, man
Tay-K, what up? Traff, what up? Uh
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
I don't know why these fifty n-s talkin' hot
There be no fifty n-s on the scene
I got like fifty rounds up in that clip
I put that fifty clip up to your beam
Then let it bang for nothing
10K in back the Wraith for nothin'
Zanotti got shot and he sang for nothin'
Hope the lawyer beat the case, a hundred
Nigga, I'm the Big Fuu, Big 092
I spent like four racks on Amiris
What the fuck they gon' tell me? Y'all n-s leery
Step back for the three like I'm Curry (Swish)
N-, I'm a big Suvy, I make a movie
Pull up and clap, you goofy
N-, I make an action movie, I make an action movie
Pul up to TD in i8
If we all getting money, then why hate?
Smoove Heasy the renty
That boy is too benty
He 'bout to go f- up the crime rate
I got twenty-twos up in my coupe
Act up in the school, we pull up, we give him the boot
And I'm big flossy woo
No construction, but a n- know I got the tool
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
Said I'm never lacking, always pistol packing
With them automatics, we gon' send 'em to Heaven
Pull up, what's crackin', n-, what you jackin'?
Find his body up on Channel 11
Bag him up, groceries
Ain't no exposing me, ain't no controlling me
No, we don't f- with them people
If I want you dead, then you dead
You know I got guns in the bed
Know I got one in the head
Free the caged whale up out the cage
Brody got locked for attempt
Ready, set, go
It's big 092 MLBOA
Hit that boy up in a GLA
Fly down your block like an eagle
And I'm so stuck in my ways
And I can't forget about the apes (Swish)
We gon' send shots where you stay
We gon' send shots where you lay
All the opps like, "Pop who?"
But I bet they wanna be Pop Smoke
Give him hot shells like taco
I'm big woo the flex, nigga, not cho
And I'm still swerving from potholes
And I'm still shooting at Tahoes
Everybody know I rock soft
Bad bitches, yeah, I got those
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
Pull up, we snatching your babas
Big 092, those my guys
Pull up and change the scenario
Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh
My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting
Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
