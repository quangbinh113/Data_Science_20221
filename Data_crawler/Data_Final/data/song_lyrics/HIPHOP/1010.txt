Song Name: Angels Never Cry (feat. MoneyBagg Yo & Kodak Black)
My life a motherfucking movie
(Yeah, you right, I don't give a fuck)
My life a movie, my life a movie
Living the lifestyle, hope I don't lose me
I'm sipping Actavis, I'm feeling woozy (oh)
I guess I see you on that other side
But our angels never cry, the gangsters never die
Shit like a movie, this ain't scripted, this ain't dramatized
That shit left me traumatized
And we had to take the harder way
Fell in love, but I got hurt, it took my heart away
When it rain, it probably pour but I seen harder days
(I know times get better)
Even though it's hard to trust someone in this cold world
Pray to God that I could love someone 'til it's over
Pray to God that he can fix my heart, make it colder
'Til that day come
I'ma be thuggin', so nigga pull up, what you cooking?
We put holes in that bitch
We ain't returning you all 'cause we put loads in that bitch
We don't go by them new laws, stick to the codes in this bitch
My diamonds got me froze in this bitch, yeah
My life a movie, my life a movie
Living the lifestyle, hope I don't lose me
I'm sipping Actavis, I'm feeling woozy (oh)
I guess I see you on that other side
But our angels never cry, the gangsters never die
Shit like a movie, this ain't scripted, this ain't dramatized
That shit left me traumatized
And we had to take the harder way (hard)
Fell in love, but I got hurt, it took my heart away (I felt like the game owed me)
When it rain, it probably pour but I seen harder days (I need that)
Seen harder days (I swear)
I sip this drank to cope my pain (hurting)
All you know is what I show you
These blood, sweat, and tears behind these chains
Spoke shit into existence when they thought it was a game (showed 'em)
Knew I was bound to shine 'cause that what come after this rain
My life a movie, e'ry day a news scene
I sip Wockesha, that's my lil' boo thing
Two men and a truck (say what), I used to move things
Happy when I get it, hate to spend it, having mood swings
My life a zoo-vie
I shoot the set up like a film for real
I swear you hurt me more than I can love or feel
Let the money bring the fame in the V trailer
Trying to get over you but I ain't able
Popping pills and pouring fifths, I'd rather die instead
Smile and lie to anyone, I'd rather cry instead
Lord just take me, why I sent them other guys?
Can't wait to see you niggas on the other side
My life a movie, my life a movie
Living the lifestyle, hope I don't lose me
I'm sipping Actavis, I'm feeling woozy (oh)
I guess I see you on that other side
But our angels never cry, the gangsters never die
Shit like a movie, this ain't scripted, this ain't dramatized
That shit left me traumatized
And we had to take the harder way
Fell in love, but I got hurt, it took my heart away
When it rain, it probably pour but I seen harder days
Seen harder days
On my project steps, looking out the window
Thinking what's my purpose? What the fuck I'm here for?
Tried to flip my first thousand, put it all in crypto
Then the market crashed, now I'm climbing in yo' window
We live a life of crime and its amazing
Made it out a hundred shootouts, bullets never grazed me
But got into a hundred fights, you know the streets raised me
Just pulled a murder, grandma think that I'm her sweet baby
My life a motherfucking movie
My life a movie, my life a movie
Living the lifestyle, hope I don't lose me
I'm sipping Actavis, I'm feeling woozy (oh)
I guess I see you on that other side
But our angels never cry, the gangsters never die
Shit like a movie, this ain't scripted, this ain't dramatized
That shit left me traumatized
And we had to take the harder way
Fell in love, but I got hurt, it took my heart away
When it rain, it probably pour but I seen harder days
Seen harder days
Even though it's hard to trust someone in this cold world
Pray to God that I could love someone 'til it's over
Pray to God that he can fix my heart, make it colder
'Til that day come
