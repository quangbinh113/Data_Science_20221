Song Name: See Wat Iâ€™m Sayin
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
First they want smoke (who?), now they just playin'
Nigga real hoes, (you) know what I'm sayin'? (That what I'm sayin')
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
Tryna fuck me soon as I land (uh)
Turn her out, she rep' my bread (go)
Four bitches can fit in the Phantom
I be with Baby when I'm in Atlanta
Since I got money, they callin' me handsome
I fell in love with this girl, she a dancer (uh, who?)
I think her name was Brianna (ow)
I get mad at the hoe, blocked her number
Head was trash, so I had to dump her (dump her)
Left her assed out like Madonna (go)
Get it in by the load, break it down, sell it whole
Either way, I'm doin' numbers (real shit)
20 Ms to the good, I need some more
Tryna bust the clock for a hunna (Ms)
Smashin' this nasty lil' bitch
I hit from the back, pullin' her frontal
Every day, I can give it, I'm really too humble
Fuck it, I'm shirt and top off for the summer (gave it)
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin', visual
Hoppin' off the jet with them bands, typical
Load up the Drac', leave a man critical
Glock with a switch in your hand, finish 'em
I know a bitch got more money than her baby dad, nigga just sad, pitiful
I know a clique that got more reppers than steppers
One gon' shoot some (maybe), out of ten of 'em
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
First they want smoke (who?), now they just playin'
Nigga real hoes, (you) know what I'm sayin'? (That what I'm sayin')
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
Tryna fuck me soon as I land (uh)
Turn her out, she rep' my bread (go)
What should I go get next? (Hm)
Paint job wet on a new blue 'Vette?
Cup full of purple, I fuck with the set
Count pink fifties on the all-black jet
Orange Hellcat when I wanna stand out (yup)
Red-black Rolls when I wanna kick back
Five rings on, never got a handout
Snuck Percs on the plane in a pack of Tic-Tacs (I skated)
One thing about dude, he gon' give it, he in his bag, too deep
Put this shit together like Chinese letters
Sauce on the Wock' up, ooh-wee
Know she get around, she think I'm green
Talkin' 'bout she fallin' too deep
Your time has expired, 14 days
Bitch, your gang too weak
Why they feel like they can play with you, Bagg?
Niggas want smoke 'til the fire on they ass (ah)
Tell 'em pop out with they foot up they ass (please)
Once I get back, I'm more mad than sad
Talk your ass off (speak)
Ain't no nigga done when they say when they facin' me (never)
Or see me and get little, run a four flat
Takin' off like they racin' me (pyoom, gone)
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
First they want smoke (who?), now they just playin'
Nigga real hoes, (you) know what I'm sayin'? (That what I'm sayin')
See what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
I'ma make 'em see what I'm sayin'
Tryna fuck me soon as I land (uh)
Turn her out, she rep' my bread (woah)
