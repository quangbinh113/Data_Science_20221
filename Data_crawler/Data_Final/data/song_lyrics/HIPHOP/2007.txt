Song Name: Let Me In
Yeah, Its 50 cent, Young Buck
G-g-g-g-g-G-unit!
We keep the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run with losers, or run with winners and win
I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I dont need security, Dis Four-Nickel enough
I came to ball wit ya'll, pop the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, n niggaz call ya dogs (I'm here)
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might neva come home again nigga, aight!
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my lifes like
Ridin' in Ca$hville and runnin all stop lightsï¼ª
Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin'
My momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison
My daddys a dope and I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years 'n a nigga still livin'
Tha same ol' 2 step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get em' Buck, you know I'ma gunna get em'
Raaaaa!
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
I know I'm sinnin' but I'm winnin' at tha same time
Took a couple shots from sum niggas tryin' to take mine
I'm back on tha block, with a choppa 'n a tech nine
Niggaz shootin' cops 'n the hood runnin stop signs
G-UNIT, the game! bitches doin' what that thugs do
G's, D's, Vice, Lords, Crips n the Bloodz too
Move lemme come through
It ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin' to some oldies
My goals be shinin', them hoes be cryin'
They handle of my 45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Ca$hville, bout to fly to Miami
Helpin' Yayo watchin' Eminem perform at the Grammys
Niggaz like Eric Benet, prolly can't stand me
'Cause I know money will make Halle Berry come outa them panties
Bitch!
Ya'll niggaz in trouble they shoulda neva let me in (in)
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach em' how to stunt, teach em' how to count stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at? Buck If you want to, we 50 deep up in here watchu gonna do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name callin'
Don't be mad 'cause we is n you aint ballin' (get money)
Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks
Can't spend ya whole life payin' on ya car note
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'ma cold young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets, 'n my peeps thas behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go 'n buy them all cars
Young Buck!
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine 'n get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke up my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D
We keep the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run with winners and win
