Song Name: Only The Team (with Lil Mosey & Lil Tjay)
Oh, oh
Lil Tjay
Pyroman
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ayy, Rvssian!
Fuck the Henny I'm pourin' codeine
Purple sprite bring a colorful dream
Foreign drip when I step on the scene
Motivated, go dumb of a bean
Steady workin' I'm up like a fiend
No security, only the team
Bodies droppin', I send out the green
Bodies droppin', I send out the green
Free my niggas that's still in the can
Everything ain't as bad as it seems
Judge offered me juvenile life
Lawyer really wasn't doing a thing
Had to get to where I'm at on my own
Just a year, it ain't take me that long
Ain't no favors, stop callin' my phone
I ain't with it boy, fix up ya' tone
No, no, no, no
I know some killers that caught 'em a body
And then they got, low, low, low, low
Snitchin' forbidden, you tell on ya' homie
Then you gotta, go, go, go, go, go
No, I ain't throwing no hands with nobody
I'm up in this po, po, po
And this bitch finna blow, blow, blow
I'm just letting you know, know, know
Fell in love with the bag, these fuck niggas mad
I'm chasing this dough, dough, dough
Steady poppin' them tags, this drip on my body
They see me like woah, woah, woah
Gettin' bread off these show, show, shows
Sippin' wok, got me slow, slow, slow
I been movin' in slow, slow mo
I just be in my own mojo
Nah, we ain't with it lil' nigga, don't try
You ain't official lil' nigga, don't lie
My niggas lurkin', they catch you in person
This ain't gon' stop unless somebody die
You ain't no killer, I see it in your eye
Fought through so much, I don't think I can cry
Get to the top, well of course I'ma try
But for now, it's just blessings that I'm carrying by
Fuck the Henny I'm pourin' codeine
Purple sprite bring a colorful dream
Foreign drip when I step on the scene
Motivated, go dumb of a bean
Steady workin' I'm up like a fiend
No security, only the team
Bodies droppin', I send out the green
Bodies droppin', I send out the green
Free my niggas that's still in the can
Everything ain't as bad as it seems
Judge offered me juvenile life
Lawyer really wasn't doing a thing
Had to get to where I'm at on my own
Just a year, it ain't take me that long
Ain't no favors, stop callin' my phone
I ain't with it boy, fix up ya' tone
No, no, no, no
Got a check and I'm living my life (I am)
Got three bad hoes tonight (Yeah)
My name on flashing lights (Flash)
How you snitch when you know you ain't right (Nah)
So saucy, I feel like the kid (Kid)
And the pack you smokin' on mid (Gas)
Did I fuck on your bitch? I did (I did)
On her knees, she givin' me head (Ooh)
Who is you lil' nigga? I don't know (I don't know)
This race car got two doors (Skrr, skrr)
Still trappin', they don't even know (No)
Got a VPN on my phone (My phone)
I told my nigga "We did it again"
I'm all in, and I'm in it to win
50 shows, I'm going all in
Open doors, and we flew in the wind (Yeah)
Looked at my brother (Brother)
Told him we'd do it again (Yeah)
We straight from the struggle
So fuck it, I'm fuckin' her friend
We caught him outside the barber shop (Brr)
Look at this brand new Audemar (Watch)
Poured the lean I'm in the stars, uhh
Fuck the Henny I'm pouring codeine (Yeah)
Purple sprite bring a colorful dream
Foreign drip when I step on the scene (Uh)
Motivated, go dumb of a bean
Steady workin' I'm up like a fiend (Fiend)
No security, only the team (Team)
Bodies droppin', I send out the green (Brr)
Bodies droppin', I send out the green (Brr, brr)
Free my niggas that's still in the can (Can)
Everything ain't as bad as it seems (No)
Judge offered me juvenile life (Life)
Lawyer really wasn't doing a thing (No)
Had to go get what I got on my own (Own)
Just a year, it ain't take me that long (Long)
Ain't no favors, stop callin' my phone

No, no, no, no
