Song Name: PENDULUM
And you became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?
(Ayo, Ian)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pendulum, swing both ways, pendulum (yeah)
Tell me my fate, pendulum
Far, far away, send your love, yeah-yeah
Pendulum, yeah, swing both ways, pendulum
Tell me my fate, pendulum
Far, far away, send your love, yeah-yeah (chyeah, uh, yeah)
I just wanna know the truth 'bout you
I just wanna know the truth 'round me
I don't want nothin' new around me
I don't need nothing new, all I need is me and you
Pendulum, tell me more, yeah-yeah
Left or right? Let me know, yeah-yeah
Tell me what I gotta do for you
Get the ceiling, raise the roof for you
Goin' crazy, act a fool for you
Lose my mind, break the rules for you, yeah
Pendulum, yeah, swing both ways, pendulum
Tell me my fate, pendulum
Far, far away, send your love, yeah-yeah
Pendulum, yeah, swing both ways, pendulum
Tell me my fate, pendulum
Far, far away, send your love, yeah-yeah
There's so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
There's so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
There's so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
There's so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
