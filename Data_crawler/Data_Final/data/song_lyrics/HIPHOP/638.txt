Song Name: Snitching (feat. Quavo & Future)
So, you got the job doing what?
Bro, I get payed to snitch now, nigga
It's really classified, I can't really talk about this shit, my nigga
Oh, my God
Only reason I'm tellin you this, 'cause you my boy
But don't fuck with me, you see what I did to Roger
You seen what I did to Roger
Forty years
He had forty years
Forty years, bitch, you don't wanna sign that plea
Forty years
Damn
Don't fuck with me
Self assured
Buddah blessed this beat
Look at my status
No, I'm not braggin', I'm not average
My bitch want a Patek
I bought her a whip and I told her to stop naggin'
Too much jewelry, my diamonds is blastin'
I bought it back in
The club is packed in
Step in your city we goin' in
Drop the top, let's blow the wind
Fuck the cops, we goin' big
Niggas out here hate the kid
'Cause I'm runnin' up when supposed to be dead, uh
Bitch, I'm a player
Nigga we're trappin', and checkin' the mail, yeah
Look at my layers, designer my jacket, I'm handin' out bills, yeah
These niggas dead, soon as I said it, they wanna go tell, yeah
The way that you playin', niggas out here workin' with 12
Damn, snitchin'
Niggas be out here snitchin', uh
Damn, snitchin'

Niggas be out here snitchin', uh, damn
They workin', they clockin', they watchin'
No stoppin, no options, we ballin', we poppin'
We goin', let's go get money, get mo' for sure
I got it, and there's plenty mo' on the boat
Nigga we came from the bottom
Yes, it's time for the boss to toast
Me and the dog got collars
We puttin' diamonds on top of the chokers (ice)
Fuck nigga, come in the lane
We droppin' him off like a floater
I ain't gon' mention his name
But if he do, then it's like that and it's over
Damn, snitchin'

Said I pull up in Amiri, got ninas attached
Walk in the buildin', I shake up the room
Fuck on your lady, no feelings attached
Don't talk out your mouth 'cause she holdin' the room
Yeah, yeah, walk in (walk in), then walk up out it
There's never a day I don't walk without it
Shoot a nigga, never talk about it
'Cause these niggas be rats, yeah
I had to shoot it in class
I had the ninas attached
Fuck and run, see I had the bitch badge
If Quavo told me get him, then I'ma do the dash
Yeah, dash, I take off like a rocket

Bobby Brown, Bobby Brown
Pick a town, I get down
Chrome hearts, chrome hearts
Bitches love my style
Look at how my wrist glow, huh
250 just for the watch, uh
Posted on the block, I was servin' for dollar
I caught a wave, it's amazing, Margiela
Audemar water, Beretta, vendetta
Tell a McCartney, you came with the bezel
Taking off just like Iraq, I got racks in my pocket
I'm havin' my way with these hoes
Shawty in love with my diamonds
She love how they twinkle
She love how they glisten, they glow
Pour up a four like I'm young Tony Stoke
One in the head, 99 more to go
Went in a winner, pull up like a GOAT
Trippin' and spillin', now that shit on the floor
Came from the gutter, that's word from the bro
I'm Evel Knievel, these niggas some divas
I'm really havin' more hits than The Beatles
I was out trappin' with keys like Alicia
I be finessin' my plug, got it cheaper
Bought some new killers, I bought some new choppers
I'm on the block with the Devil, I hang with the robbers
Any hood we go, they treat me like God, huh
Switch up the flow for the visual
Just so you know that I'm spiritual
All of my money identical
Bluefaces, bluefaces keep me a hundred
They on the woo shit
Niggas gon' shoot your shit
You ain't no woo, nigga
You ain't gon' do shit
Damn, snitchin'
Niggas be out here snitchin', uh
Damn, snitchin'
Niggas be out here snitchin', uh
Snitchin', snitchin'
Niggas be out here snitchin', uh
Damn
Niggas be out here snitchin'
