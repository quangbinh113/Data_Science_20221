Song Name: Show Out (with Skepta & Pop Smoke)
Mmm, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ah, uh, uh
Look
Show out, show up (grrt)
Back out, pole up
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up
Show out, show up (grrt)
Back out, pole up
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up
All my niggas is ready to go
Pop Smoke, big smoke
Clip in the stick, stick in the coat (boom!)
And they got guns same size as Kevin Hart
Please don't think it's a joke
Back on tour with the gang and it's sold out
22 dates, I ain't missin' a show
Got the ladies hittin' my phone (brrr)
Got the mandem hittin' the woah (greaze)
Me plus ten on the list, they know how I'm comin'
I'm bringin' the bros
And I got G's that's stuck in the trap, no government name
They stick to the code (ice)
Left wrist Audemars Piguet, right wrist whippin' the whip on the stove
He don't care 'bout fame, he just tryna get rich on the low
Show out, show up (see us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole up (got 'em runnin', runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up (roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up (we are supreme, she see what I mean)
Show out, show up (see us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole up (got 'em runnin', runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up (roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up (we are supreme, she see what I mean)
Me and the team runnin' up, hit 'em up
Send 'em up, get 'em on impact (blaow)
Pull up on scene, have 'em all lookin', we stuntin'
No, can not forget that (uh)
Gather 'round, niggas, the realer, mane (yeah)
Look in the mirror, see who you are (are)
All of this evil that's in my way, I pray to God with open arms
No, can't trip, get grip, hands all over these chips, watch this flip
No, see, I ain't no bitch but I'm bent
I parlay with chicks, the man, the myth
See, I'm not dwellin' on that (uh)
Focus on runnin' these laps, believe (believe)
Who could it be?
Why am I feelin' so hellish? The devil, indeed (huh)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (yeah)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (uh)
Am I lost? Pray for me, ooh, yeah (yuh)
Dream on, fly away (yuh), dream on (uh)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (yeah)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (go)
Am I lost? Pray for me, what's it cost? Everything
Dream on, fly away, dream on
Show out, show up (see us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole up (got 'em runnin', runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up (roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up (we are supreme, she see what I mean)
Show out, show up (see us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole up (got 'em runnin', runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up (roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up (we are supreme, she see what I mean)
