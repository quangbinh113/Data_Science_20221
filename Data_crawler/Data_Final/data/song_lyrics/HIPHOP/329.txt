Song Name: Undefeated (feat. Lil Keed)
I got that tool when I walk out that door
Got some head in the coupe and let off in her nose
I got some bougie chick holdin' my chopper
I got some bougie chick doin' my chores
I got that bougie chick loadin' my Glock
I got that bougie chick foldin' my clothes
Ay, I got that Glock on the seat
Ay, next to that choppa on the seat
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
Ay, I got some blood on my sneakers
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
Two loaded guns, I got double the shells
Count all the blue when I'm in the Chanel
Choppa in the Coupe and I move like a snail
You could smell all type of Kush in the air
Supply and demand and you movin' them bells
You keepin' that paper, it's hot on your trail
Shootin' the laser, yeah
Fresh in the blazer, yeah
Wrist like a glacier, yeah
Sharp as a razor, yeah
Big as a mayor, yeah
Her and slay her, yeah
Trust me, the player, yeah
I do not eat her, yeah
I'm undefeated, yeah
It's therapeutic, yeah
I got that tool when I walk out that door
Got some head in the coupe and I let off in her nose
I got some bougie chick holdin' my chopper
I got some bougie chick doin' my chores
I got that bougie chick loadin' my Glock
I got that bougie chick foldin' my clothes
Low as the vibes, they meet at the dock
Hand on that fire when I whip in that block
Family gon' die when it come to the boss
Spray with the five when you hear the exhaust
Count so much money, it got me exhausted
I was in the dungeon before takin' off
Stay in the streets and I'm breakin' the law
Hang on that corner and they sendin' that boy
You come with them dollars, you come for the boy
Came with the style, this drip isn't a sport
Ay, I got that Glock on the seat
Ay, next to that choppa on the seat
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
I got that bougie chick foldin' my clothes
I got that bougie chick totin' a pole
I grant that wish like a Cosmo
Bentley truck, not a Tahoe
Bashout, a thousand or more
Headshot, put the cash on you, fool
Gucci socks, Chanel, too
Big slime, bringin' all the hoes
Yeah, baby, I'm thuggin', I don't know about you
Yeah, John Wick, shooter, yeah they killin', ooh
Yes, I'm a big deal, pocket full of blues
'Leven hunnid for the pant, 'leven for the shoes
Christian Dior, Cuban link, Honolulu
You are not with it
These niggas tellin'
I seen it on television
Yeah, I send 'em some racks
He gon' wrap it and mail it
Yeah, I sent the ho home
She was actin' too petty
I got that tool when I walk out that door
Got some head in the coupe and I let off in her nose
I got some bougie chick holdin' my chopper
I got some bougie chick doin' my chores
I got that bougie chick loadin' my Glock
I got that bougie chick foldin' my clothes
When she a pool, slip out the shoes
It be so cool, sit by the pool
Who got the tool? Gimme the tool
If you gon' snooze, then we gon' lose
Shoot at the fool, then Whinnie the Pooh
Put it on cruise, makin' her drool
Makin' the news, makin' the news
Scratchin' her mouth, makin' the news
Ay, I got that Glock on the seat
Ay, next to that choppa on the seat
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
Ay, come up too close and I'm tweakin'
Ay, I got some blood on my sneakers
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
Ay, I just shot cum on her feet
I'm undefeated, yeah
I'm undefeated, yeah
