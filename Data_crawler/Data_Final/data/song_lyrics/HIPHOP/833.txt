Song Name: Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Fa (Fa), fa (Fa), fa (Fa)
Father
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'mma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you, uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want (I wanna wake up with you in my eyes)
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
