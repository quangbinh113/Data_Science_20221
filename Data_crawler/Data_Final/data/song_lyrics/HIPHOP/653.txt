Song Name: Up Up And Away
Yeah
Up, up and away I been
Feel the walls in my brain, and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised (uh)
Maybe I realize that my life is a ride
Buckle up, hold tight, take a left, turn right
GPS don't work,and I can't see at night
So it's getting hard to drive, anxiety at a stoplight
Hard to think, easy to cry, that's how I know something's not right
Numb the pain with fun times, supermodels, Perc lines
Remember that one time everything was alright
Alright (oh-oh-oh)
Up, up and away I been
Feel the walls in my brain, and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Up, up and away I been
Feel the walls in my brain, and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves (all these waves)
