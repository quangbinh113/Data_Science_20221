Song Name: Fame & Riches (with Roddy Ricch)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh (I'm Harry, Harry Potter)
Living lawless, they might say I'm a menace
Father God, I just pray for forgiveness
We fell off and shit got strange 'cause of distance
Wish I could get some millions in exchange for my feelings
Feel like you had it harder, we felt pain, what's the difference?
Lil' bro gon' let it bang, fuck a witness
Cold killer raised from the trenches
For my dawgs, I'd give up all the fame and the riches
Just remember my name when I'm finished
Baby, this Ralph Lauren, not Lacoste, tryna shake these toxic thoughts
But if a pussy play, we knock him off
And when I had a kid, I seen what my mama saw
Got niggas pocket watching, tryna add up what I bought
He might get a halo from these hollows
Been drownin' in my sorrows, but hopefully I'll be fine by tomorrow
In my feelings in this Wraith 'cause that's where stars cope
Insecure, but he so scared to let his scars show
Might cash out on the 'Vette like fuck a car note
Tired of being heart broke, numb to the pain, he let his heart go
Posted on the strip, selling Demi Lovato
Pull up, take his soul, we don't borrow (fuck the opps, get money, that's the motto)
Living lawless, they might say I'm a menace
Father God, I just pray for forgiveness
We fell off and shit got strange 'cause of distance
Wish I could get some millions in exchange for my feelings
Feel like you had it harder, we felt pain, what's the difference?
Lil' bro gon' let it bang, fuck a witness
Cold killer raised from the trenches
For my dawgs, I'd give up all the fame and the riches
Just remember my name when I'm finished
Ayy, time wait for no man, I'm off this romance
She just wanna fuck to Jamie Foxx and Kanye West, "Slow Jamz"
Been taking it slow, ain't popped a pill in a minute
And sometimes I don't know who by my side 'cause these niggas tell me lies
Got crossed too many times, you can't catch me by surprise
My mama took me to church, I'm tryna keep up with my tithes
Got a purpose, gotta stay up on they tops, I know they praying I'ma flop
They ain't know I was a blessing in disguise
And I know that if I ended up in prison, they'll never ever visit
They'll never ever send a J-Pay
I promise, I'ma make it home to my lil' baby
I promise to never ever listen to nay say (nay say)
So I gotta keep it true, woo-woo, woo-woo
Make sure I keep a cutter, watch out for my lil' brother
Living lawless, they might say I'm a menace
Father God, I just pray for forgiveness
We fell off and shit got strange 'cause of distance
Wish I could get some millions in exchange for my feelings
Feel like you had it harder, we felt pain, what's the difference?
Lil' bro gon' let it bang, fuck a witness
Cold killer raised from the trenches
For my dawgs, I'd give up all the fame and the riches
Just remember my name when I'm finished (when I'm finished)
