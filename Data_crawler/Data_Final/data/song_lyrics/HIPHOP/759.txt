Song Name: The Most High
Uh, stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch, we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high
Uh, devil want a nigga soul
I beat that nigga thousand times in a row
Couple weeks ago, he thought he threw his best shot
All I'm lookin' at is Twitter playin' "friend-or-foe"
Clout chasers need the relevancy
Hard talk come from irrelevant MC's
None of those guys are relevant as me
Guess what that means, I'm on a whole 'nother league
Wait, don't stop, let's sell another story (Ah)
What the fuck happened to rap? This isn't for me (Ah)
Never did I ever think that I would see the day (Nah)
Rap niggas tellin' the cops to come for me (Uh)
They tried to turn me to a cold felon (Facts)
All they helped me do is get some more millions (More facts)
All I see is, "Free Tory, free Tory" (Hahaha)
Homie, I was in Miami on the shore chillin' (He's wildin')
I got a whole new chick, mean
We on the Island and she fuck me like she off a bean
I'm out in Jersey and I'm ballin' like I'm off the team (We high)
I bought a four, it's a Birkin or it's all Celine
Stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop (I did that)
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop (That's a fact too)
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent (Hahaha)
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high
Soon as I get my masters back, they want chatter (Haha)
Now I'm independent, niggas won't fend it (Facts)
White labels tryna turn my Black folk against me
Been sellin' weed, that nigga don't affect me (Ha)
Tell my trappers get the bloomin' bags ready (Bag ready)
We finna fill 'em bitches up with mad reggie (Already)
Take 'em to the block, sell 'em at exclusive price (Haha)
And if they ask why it's trash, at least the bag heavy (Hahaha)
Devil want a nigga soul (Facts)
I beat that nigga a thousand times in a row (Nigga, facts)
Ballin' on a demon like a pick-and-roll (Facts)
She ugly, then I gotta hit her with the woah (This woah)
Shit up in this bitch, goin' hard nigga (Goin' hard, baby)
Runnin' through these bitches like a yard, nigga (Like a yard, baby)
I'm watchin' Complex for the talks, nigga (Woo)
'Cause it's an everyday struggle, fuck Mal, nigga (Nigga, fuck 'em)
I got love for 'em 'til they count me out (Uh)
Niggas mad I spun they bitches like a roundabout (Nah)
I see niggas tryna kick me when I'm down and out (I see you, baby)
But I came in here with a purpose I ain't
'Round for clout (I worked nights for this)
Uh, Illuminati trynna get me, nigga (Facts)
But I'm the one they gotta spare like a Britney, nigga (Nigga, facts)
Through the hot or cold, I will never sell my soul (Never)
And if I gotta die for that, I'm dyin' Christian, nigga
I spent four seasons at the Four Seasons (That's regular)
I might even flex just for no reason (Regular)
Got a penthouse in D.R. and P.R
I call it pH balance and it's Puerto Rican (Haha)
These niggas don't like me (They don't like me)
I'm finna Gucci, man, and I'm so icy (Super ice, nigga)
Uh, wear these niggas out like a white tee (Ah)
My comeback rate super pricy (We checked it)
Stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop (I did that)
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop (That's a fact too)
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent (Hahaha)
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high
