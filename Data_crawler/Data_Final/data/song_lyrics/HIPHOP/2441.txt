Song Name: Big Energy
Got that real big energy
Hey daddy
When you gon' stop playing?
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Tell me how you want it
Three, two, one and I'm on it
Feel good, don't it?
Hood bitch, fuck you in a bonnet
I'ma bust it on the pole like Onyx
I'm just being honest
Pussy juicy, Minute Maid
But can't do it one minute, man
Not a side or a main, I'm the only bitch he entertain
Spending his, mine in the bank (in the bank)
I like what I see
A boss like you need a boss like me
Daddy from the streets, so he move low-key
Tryna rock that mic' like karaoke
On the count of three, bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we 'on't want it (we 'on't want it)
I'm the one you bitches hate, but they can't get past
Pretty face, no waist, and a big ol' ass, ha
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy)
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy)
Yeah, tell me how you want it
Three, two, one, camera rolling
Do it slow motion
Real bitch, them other hoes phoney
All that big talk, Latto put 'em on it
I'm just being honest, lingerie Dolce
Blindfold, tie me to the bed while we role-play
Can't skip foreplay, kill the pussy, cold case
I'm a boss bitch, but tonight, we do it your way
On the count of three, bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we 'on't want it (hell nah)
If you ever see me broke, I'm prolly rocking a cast
Pretty face, no waist, with a big ol' bag, ha
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy, yuh)
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy, ayy)
