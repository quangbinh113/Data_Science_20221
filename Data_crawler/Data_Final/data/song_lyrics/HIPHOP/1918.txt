Song Name: So Good
Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars (bars)
She's well put together, like a piece by Gershwin (Gershwin)
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy, oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
Suffering from first class cabin fever (hey)
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt (hey)
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza (Giza)
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa (Pisa)
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature (hey)
Swagger like Caesar (hey), I'll get you a visa (hey)
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum ('seum)
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy, oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
Well, I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural (plural)
Spin the globe, whatever it lands that's where we'll go (we'll go)
We'll hit up Europe (Europe), yep, and spend some Euros (Euros)
And maybe visit Berlin (berlin), the walls with the murals (murals)
This is your month baby, sign off the Virgo (Virgo)
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot (Merlot)
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy, oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la-la
You never had it so good
La, la-la, la-la...
