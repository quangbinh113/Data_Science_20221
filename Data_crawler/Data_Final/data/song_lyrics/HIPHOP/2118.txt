Song Name: Shadowboxin'
(Special technique) fuck that
(Spe-special technique of shadowboxing) God damn
(The GZA, God damn)
(The GZA, God damn) pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
(Method, god damn) I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
(Maximilli-on, Maximilli-on)
(Uh, yeah, ahh, uh) Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
(Johnny Blaze) Maximilli-on
Maximilli-on Maximilli-on
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speakin' Scud missile heat seekin'
Johnny Blazing
Nightmares like Wes Craven, niggas gunnin'
My third eye seen it comin' before it happen
You know about them fuckin' Staten Kids they smashin'
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin' (hmm)
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? (Hmm)
Talkin' out your asshole
You shoulda learnt 'bout the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin'
Know just what the fuck I'm doin', rap insomniac
Fiend to catch a nigga snoozing, slip the cardiac
Arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop posses me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my Steez
Burnin' to the third degree, sneaky ass
Allley cat top pedigree, the head toucher
Industry party bum rusher
You don't like a dick up in ya, fuck ya
(Allow me to demonstrate) that's right, you corny-ass
(The skill of Shaolin) rap motherfuckers
(The special technique) better go back and check
(Of shadowboxing) your fuckin' stacks
(Shadowboxing) 'cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your reefs ain't rugged enough
Bitch
I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynchin' and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
'Cause RZA, to charge niggas 20G's a session
When my mind start to clickin', and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotten pickin' fuck
About a brother tryin' to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at mama baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa Bee, that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin' son
Wu brother number one, protect ya neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spittin' words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nutsac, and spittin' lung-ghies
At a wack nigga that, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill projects
How to be exact, break it down
All and Together Now
Things are gettin' good lookin' better now
(Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin)
(Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing)
(Shadowboxing)
Oh mayne, oh mayne
Oh mayne, oh mayne
(Allow me to demonstrate)
