Song Name: all good (feat. Future)
Ronny J, please turn me up
Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, LeBron James, on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef how I been flippin' all this cake
Got a flock of famous hoes, took 'em to Barbados
Purple drink, sippin' bitch, why you on that K-Roll?
We ain't at no playground, I'ma show you how I play though
Bitch say I'm playin' mind games with her, she call me Play-Doh
I want a motherfuckin' Janet Jackson
I'm sittin' in front of the TV, thinkin' I need a actress
Yo' wheel cost more than your front door
All I do is point at the hoe and she come closer
Body like a two=liter, ass fat as hell, nigga
Got a smart bitch at the 'partment, about to graduate from Yale
A high maintenance nigga, bitches compliment my nails
You know it ain't no goin' against the grain, I'ma prevail
This coupe talk to spoiler, lookin' like a damn tail
Only 500 whips like this Demon out of hell
We outside, you been inside, nigga, we can tell
My crib double gated, save that shit for all my haters
Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, LeBron James, on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef how I been flippin' all this cake
My racks all good, my bitch all good
My wrists all good, my hood all good
Sittin' court-side higher than the moon
Rich nigga, fuck your bitch like a goon
Rolls-Royce, Ghosts floatin', tycoon
Pink diamonds, solitaries, cost me a stack of blues
Posted up with the robber, servin' dog food
Smoke 'em up, roll the opp up, block him out his shoes
Standin' in the trenches with my jewelry
I put all my killers on security
My shooters, they evil, sit court-side with a heater
How the fuck I'ma ever go Hollywood?
I switched out my stripper with a pop star
In a vehicle too fast to stop for a cop car
I got pink diamonds on me, it was dirty Sprite
Bad bitch rockin' Louis, she look off white
Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, LeBron James, on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef how I been flippin' all this cake
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef how I been flippin' all this cake
A bakery chef how I been flippin' all this cake
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
