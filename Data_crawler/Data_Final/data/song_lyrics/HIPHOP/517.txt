Song Name: Call Out
I don't want nothing
I'ma fall down
Taylor 'bout to fuckin' flex
I ain't finna fall down
4th quarter shorty I'ma ball out
Don't go to work baby call out
Ain't no waiting no stall now
I'm finna ball out
4th quarter shorty no call outs
Don't go to work baby just call out, uh
In the bedroom, all out
Percs on the counter can't wait to take them
Blunts on the counter can't wait to face it
Bad little bitch yeah, she be my favorite
All my songs they all on her playlist
I don't really know how to say it but I'ma say it
I don't really know if she take it but she can take it
I don't slow it down unless I'm in the matrix
Presidential brain that bitch like Sarah Palin
Here it go, I'm not the same nigga that I was a year ago
I thank God every day for it, it's a miracle
In the trap house singing negro spirituals, yeah
Aunt Jemima, best believe I'm in the trap and Jalany
Pull up on them with the Rollie that's perfect timing
I guess that means that the stars align, uh
Gun sing like CeCe Winans
Change shit just like the climate
Sit back and my seat reclining
I call that shit perfect timing
I'm in another country getting new money
My money got depression yeah, it's blue money
Feeling like I had depression I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack then I blew or something, uh uh
Listen to the way I flow off this shit is off the top like a wave cap
Pull up on the scene and you getting knocked like a base bat
Put the Mac 11 bullet where ya fuckin' face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat, huh
And that's where the bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat, uh
And that's where the bitch put her face at
I ain't finna fall down
4th quarter shorty I'ma ball out
Don't go to work baby call out
Ain't no waiting no stall now
I'm finna ball out
4th quarter shorty no call outs
Don't go to work baby just call out, uh
In the bedroom, all out
I ain't finna fall down
4th quarter shorty I'ma ball out
Don't go to work baby call out
Ain't no waiting no stall now
I'm finna ball out
4th quarter shorty no call outs
Don't go to work baby just call out, uh
In the bedroom, all out
