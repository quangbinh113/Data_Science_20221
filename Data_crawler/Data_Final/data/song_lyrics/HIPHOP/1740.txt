Song Name: CHURCH GIRL
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
I been up, I been down
Feel like I move mountains, got friends that cried fountains, ooh
I'm warning everybody soon as I get in this party
I'm gon' let go of this body, I'm gonna love on me
Nobody can judge me but me, I was born free
I'll drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
I said now pop it like a thottie, pop it like a thottie (you bad)
We said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (you bad)
Church girls acting loose, bad girls acting snotty (you bad)
Let it go, girl (let it go), let it out, girl (let it out)
I do that dance like you came up out the South, girl (Uh, uh)
I said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (You bad)
Bad girl acting naughty, church girl, don't hurt nobody
You can be my daddy if you want to
You, you can be my daddy if you want to
You can get it tatted if you want to
You, you can get it tatted if you want to (she ain't gonna hurt nobody)
Put your lighters in the sky, get this motherfucker litty
She gon' shake them tass and them pretty tig old bitties (huh)
So get your acts up (what), get your map up (huh)
I'ma back it up (ah), back it, back it up (back it, back it up)
I'ma buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it, act it up (act it up)
I see them grey sweats (grey sweats), I see a blank check
I'm finally on the other side, I finally found the extra smiles
Swimming through the oceans of tears we cried (tears that we've cried)
You know we got church in the morning (the morning)
But you doin' God's work, you goin' in
She ain't tryna hurt nobody, she just tryna do the best she can
Happy on her own with her friends, without a man
I'm warning everybody soon as I get in this party
I'm gon' let go of this body, I'm gonna love on me
Nobody can judge me but me, I was born free
I'll drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
I said now pop it like a thottie, pop it like a thottie (you bad)
We said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (you bad)
Church girls acting loose, bad girls acting snotty (you bad)
Let it go, girl (let it go), let it out, girl (let it out)
I do that dance like you came up out the South, girl (uh, uh)
I said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (you bad)
Bad girls acting raunchy, church girl, don't hurt nobody
You can be my daddy if you want to (you bad)
You, you can get it tatted if you want to (you bad)
Put your lighters in the sky, get this motherfucker litty (you bad)
She gon' shake them tass and them pretty tig old bitties
So get your acts up (uh), get your map up (uh-uh)
I'ma back it up (back it up), back it, back it up (back it, back it up)
I'ma buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it, act it up (act it up)
I see them grey sweats (grey sweats), I see a blank check
Must be the cash 'cause it ain't you face
It must be the cash 'cause it ain't you face
Now do it, baby, stick it, baby, do it, baby, stick it
Baby, do it, baby, spin it, spin it, baby, do it
Spin that cash a little harder, and she might let you dive in the water
Drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Na, na, na, drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Oh, oh, oh, drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Good girls actin' bad, church girls don't hurt nobody
I ain't tryna hurt nobody, tryna bring a life up in your body
