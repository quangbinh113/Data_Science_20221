Song Name: Projects
I don't stay in them projects
I don't stay in them projects (yeah)
I don't stay in them (hey) projects (yeah)
I don't stay in them (hey) projects (ayy)
I'm still in the projects, Section-8 (yeah)
Matter fact I was just over there (yeah)
Went to my ghetto bitch spot in the back (parked)
Sat on the porch while she braided my hair
The trap open wide everybody outside
Knock on the door twice if you wanna 3-5
My nigga keep loud but he sell it quiet
'Cause niggas be 12, that's seven plus five (ayy)
You ever sold candy to the candy lady
Mama worked all the time, I wasgrandma baby (spoiled)
Jumped off the porch, picked up a .380
It jammed a couple times, thank God I made it (Amen)
Fast-forward I picked up a Glock
Put one hunnid shots in my three hunnid chop
Cruisin' down Collins, my arm out the window
Sapphire rich, yeah, you see through my watch
Eat it up
Came from nothin', no rearview gang
I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word
Then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private, took ten black trucks to the projects (go)
Came from nothin', no rearview gang
I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word
Then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private (where you at?)
Took ten black trucks to the projects (go)
Gotta pay what you weight if you tryna get 'em (why?)
Comin' out the house be too expensive
Before rap, it was ten mile apartment projects
Where the bloods into it with the hoover niggas ('member?)
Used to stay in True Religion denim
Now Amiri, these racks can't even fit up in 'em
Fuck with the lil' hoe upstairs from me
She gone get me a rental, fried chicken for dinner (ratchet)
12 hit the block, nothin' stopped, still getting it
Bullshit down shop every Tuesday, Thursday (knocked)
Slid four deep in the famous suburban (what happened?)
Slam on the opp block, you deserve it (brr)
Them niggas trappin', but they weed ain't exotic
They boilin' and drinkin' they water with it (ah)
Turn my struggle to money I made 'em feel me
It was hard to believe now they know I'm different (go)
I come from where you can get crossed on the move (Memphis)
Back seat gon' treat 'em like BooBoo the Fool (clown)
Rich get my setup, put him in my casa
You gotta die too since you vouched for that dude (yeah)
'Member Hitech was like 40 a line
Now it's discontinued too hard to find (go)
18 years old, I committed that crime
Walked that shit down 1129 (in the projects)
Came from nothin', no rearview gang
I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word
Then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private (yeah)
Took ten black trucks to the projects (go)
Came from nothin', no rearview gang
I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word
Then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private (where you at?)
Took ten black trucks to the projects (go)
I don't stay in them (hey) projects (hey)
I don't stay in them (yeah) projects (yeah)
I don't stay in them (hey) projects (yeah)
I don't stay in them (hey) projects
