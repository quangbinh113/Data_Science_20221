Song Name: 2 Million Up (feat. Rob49)
Oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, CT
If we locked in, ain't no switchin' up
Brodie came home, went to pick him up
Nigga killed my mans, I'm riding with a picture of him
Shoot back to the crib, went to pick the switches up
Stolen Track hawk, got it tinted up
Caught him outside, now he in a blunt
Ain't no falling off, I done put two million up, nigga
Aint no failing off, I done put two million up
Caught his ass at the light like Tupac and hit him up
Ain't no life after death nigga you ain't big enough
Know them younglings mean business when they in that rental truck
They gon' spin til' they dizzy or the police pick em' up
I been stayin' out the way, I been focused on this pape'
Killers coming out of retirement the day a nigga play
Hit your man with a package, he don't pay I make him pay
I could stop selling all this shit today with what I made today
Niggas probably won't admit it, but I paved the way
Who else you know made all those millions and ain't signed no papers?
Did my time like a gangster, never made a statement
It's fuck niggas like I'm racist
Niggas wasn't there when we was rappin' in the basement
They were throwin' parties, we were cookin' crack and shavin'
Hit your house party, fuck it up, we misbehaving
Gotta keep an eye on my nigga Slim cause he shady
Take it out the water, let it dry, put it on a ruler
He ain't know what he was doin', I had to school him
Teach you how to turn a half to a whole one, I'm a tutor
Have you jumpin' out a foreign, pockets filled with all blue ones
Thirty in the glitzy, bitch, I'm ridin' with a cougar
Red and green Gucci sweater on just like Freddy Krueger
Everybody 'round me family, nigga, we don't do recruitin'
Everybody 'round me shooters, ain't no tellin' who
Was shootin', nigga
Tell promoters book me, we gone come and make a movie
All my friends dead, got me ridin' with this Uzi
Got some niggas in the feds, got some niggas in the state
Got some niggas goin' in, got some niggas on the way
Told brodie take the plea, live to fight another day
Went to trial and he lost and they gave him all day
Collect call, pick it up, feel him smilin' through the phone
Told me keep my feet on these niggas' neck 'til he come home
You know it's on
If we locked in, ain't no switchin' up
Brodie came home, went to pick him up
Nigga killed my mans, I'm riding with a picture of him
Shoot back to the crib, went to pick the switches up
Stolen track hawk, got it tinted up
Caught him outside, now he in a blunt
Ain't no falling off, I done put two million up, nigga
Ain't no failing off, I done put two million up
