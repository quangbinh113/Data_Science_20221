Song Name: Gore
I said even if it kills me
I'ma always keep it real, b
Yeah, ya dig
Yeah, yeah, yeah-I, yeah-I, yeah-I
I said even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win
Yeah, I said even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win (huh)
I said even if it kills me
Even if it kills me
Even if it kills me
Hold 'up, ay
Put that on my momma, fuck that drama
I'ma keep getting these commas
On my momma, got a nigga ballin' like I'm Iguodala
For the dollar, I go brazy on this set
Keep a ratchet it go 'blat!'
If you talk down you get blessed
With this yoppa at your neck, I don't want no smoke
I don't play no games, I don't tell no jokes
If a nigga try me best believe that nigga gettin' poked
Got this water on my neck, you try to take it you get soaked (uh)
That's that heat wave, let the heat blaze
Left hand came back, like LeBron Heat days
Keep the peace, ay, gotta keep the peace way
'Cause it get real, nigga, for Pete's sake
I said, even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win
Yeah, I said even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win (huh)
I said even if it kills me
Even if it kills me
Even if it kills me
Yeah, put that on my mom
Put that on my mom
Put that on my mom, put that on my mom
Put that on my mom, even if it kills me, even if it kills me, ay
Even if it kills me, ay
Even if it, ay
Even if it, ay, huh
I said, even if it kills me, even if it kills me, even if it kills me
