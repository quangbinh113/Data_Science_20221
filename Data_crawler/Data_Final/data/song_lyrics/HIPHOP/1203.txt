Song Name: Ballad of a Badman
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you got me

Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you got me
You have to leave, just stay for a while
The longer you stay, the better the time
You listen to your friends, they lie
I don't mind, I don't mind
Feelings get caught up in the mind
A shooting star pass by my eye
When I don't know just what to do
She won't blow my high
Don't you stop turning me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turning me on (don't you stop turning me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long)

(Turnin' me on)
(All night long)
You wanna stay, just stay for long
'Cause you got the sweetest touch I know
You might just dance with them other guys
But I don't mind, I know you're mine
I don't care just what they say
Lovin' you long takes the pain away
So when you look me in my eyes
Will you take some time?
Don't you stop turning me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turning me on (don't you stop turning me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long)

(Turnin' me on)
It's just, I can't fight this feeling
Woah, oh-oh, ooh-woah, yeah
Ooh-woah, oh, oh
I can't fight this feeling
Woah, ooh-woah, oh, woah, ooh, yeah
Don't fight this feeling
Don't fight this feeling, ooh-woah, ooh-ooh, woah, oh
Don't you stop turning me on (don't you stop turning me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this for oh so long)
Don't you stop turning me on (don't you stop turning me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long)
Don't you stop turning me on (turning me on)
I wanna feel like this all night long (all night long)
Don't you stop turning me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turning me on (don't you stop turning me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turning me on (ooh, you got me)
Feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turning me on (ooh, you got me)
Feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
