Song Name: The Tonight Show
Yeah, yeah
La-da-da, la-da, la-da, la-da, la-da, la-da
Uh
Nigga, the crib got the 12 person staff (nigga, nigga)
Security in the grounds keep an armed hand (armed hand)
One of the illest niggas on, off land, asphalt or soft sand (yeah)
I been as fast as The Flash, a lil' class and pizzazz (a lil' class and pizzazz)
Prefer that water for crystal over your wine glass (over your wine glass)
This a different bracket, the ones who really have it (the ones who have it)
This the James Worthy and New Balance
Brand new Converse on Magic, the goggles on Kurt Rambis (on magic)
Showtime, whole row of Rolls Royces and the first one mine (one mine)
One of thе livin' legends, rep thе Eastside
Shots fired, claim lives, youngins abandoned they G-ride (claim lives)
They set that bitch on fire, the bounty on your head was high, like (on fire)
Finna cash that bitch in, it shine
That shit a shame, but that shit be happenin' all the time (shit be happenin'all the time)
They don't know how to cry because them boys desensitized (they desensitized)
Ambitious and ready to ride, anxious, ready to slide (ready to ride, ready to slide)
Angry and they outside, we hangin' out, we too high (outside, too high)
You gon' get picked like fruit
I'm in New Orleans where the killers got the juice (killers got the juice)
And some suggestions say it might be best I move (best I move)
But if I dipped, who else gon' bring them spaceships through like I do? (Who else? Who else? Like I do)
My car collection special, Jay Leno of the NO
Kept every car I ever bought, each of 'em sentimental
Represent the hard work, each one is a symbol
Of when I started makin' real dough for wreckin' venues (wreckin' venues)
Smoke session continues
Eeny, miny, mo, and pick somethin' cold to slip up into
I get with you (I get with you, I get with you)
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Keep the E in it, Chevys on switches
Girl, we smokin' weed in it, don't post me in your pictures
If you can keep a secret, we can always kick it
Baby, rule number one, don't talk about me 'round your nigga
Shit, you gon' have that nigga suspicious
We hittin' switches on Chev, highway dippin' (highway dippin')
Loose lips sink ships and my ship ain't sinkin' (ain't sinkin')
Yeah
I still got my little hood shit in me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't really like to be around lot of motherfuckers, you know?
I just like to stay to myself or with my immediate niggas
And it's kind of hard to do, uh, if you in the limelight
'Cause they'll look at you like- you know what I'm sayin'?
You gotta really, you gotta play the role
You gotta smile up in motherfuckers faces
You gotta go places you may not wanna go
You have to do things you may not wanna do
And it was hard, it's still hard
