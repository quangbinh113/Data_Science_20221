Ooh-ooh
Courtside, dope seats not up in the nosebleeds
Oh damn, woah, sheesh
Everybody knows me now
Life speeding, and it don't slow down
For a nigga like me really a
Rockstar, wake up bella on my belly
Wagyu steak stay casin' for a safe space
Working on my communicate
Real familiar with love
But I'm not immune to hate
Free all my folks from the judge they came in to clean the place (Free)
Free our mind
We smoke da' vine cause we divine
I scope the vision with three eyes
I'm aligned and I'm alkalined I'm baba, my ori proper
Boom chakra, lock down, can't stop us, young conquer
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when there's no one around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
My uncle called me, he been jammed since I was hardly walking
Told me them niggas in the yard be always talking 'bout me
"Nigga, that's my nephew," what he said, it make him proud, he smiled
I can imagine how he feel 'cause every time my sister call me
Tellin' me them stories
'Bout how Lil JJ done got straight A's
That boy astronomic
A single mommy, well, not for real, her dude in jail
Revolvin' story 'round my worry, lay our nappy heads
I wrote this song, a thought provoker
Empty heart that's broke
Defibrillator full of flavor as I wrote my smoke
Wish I could pass it but this Panny turned me to germaphobe
Bitch, we the wave and the boat, my heart been glacier cold, but if you needed to know
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when there's no one around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
I'll be loved when no one's around (I'll be loved, loved, when no one's around)
And, uh, so, uh
When she told me your rap name, right?
Yeah
I said, "Smino?"
They were just tellin' me about him
I didn't know your rap name right now
When they told me, I went to put it in the kiosk one day, boom it popped up
I asked them boys "How you spell it?" So I put it in, you know
It popped right up
I was like, "Wow, hey, look, my nephew, he all the way over here on the kiosk, he doin' big things
His daddy was gifted, now he gifted, you know?"
