Song Name: Reckless
Reckless
Stole my heart and put it on a necklace
Wind back the clock, baby girl, time is precious
Now I know that loving you's a death wish
Tell me how it feels to take advantage of love
Restless
Your voice inside my head, the echo endless
Let down my guard, every time I regret it
Even though I know you were pretending
When I said I loved you, I meant it
Numb inside
Photos on the wall, I can't stand the sight
'Cause everywhere I look I see you and I
It's torture, baby, I don't even feel alive, I can't even cry
Hole inside
My heart, you took advantage of my trust, oh why'd
You have to ruin all our memories?
I tried everything to keep you by my side
But I can't love a lie
Come back
Quit wasting time on love you know that won't last
When this heart's only for you, I could show that
In everything I do for you, you'd know that
All of me I'll give to you, won't hold back
Trust in us, oh I believe we'll grow that
And anytime you need me I'll be right there
I've been here before, I know you're scared
Your heart I'm tryna repair, 'cause I know that love is
Reckless
Stole my heart and put it on a necklace
Wind back the clock, baby girl, time is precious
Now I know that loving you's a death wish
Tell me how it feels to take advantage of love
Restless
Your voice inside my head, the echo endless
Let down my guard, every time I regret it
Even though I know you were pretending
When I said I loved you, I meant it
Silhouette of you, playin' on a loop in my head
It was all a ruse, didn't mean a word that you said
I gave you my heart, you wanted my soul instead
This an SOS but no one here to save me, I'm dead
Caught up in a lie, can't forget the words you said
The way you made me feel, even if it's all pretend
Poison in my veins, I can never trust again
Look into my eyes, I want you to see what you
Did to me
Tried but I can't erase all our history
Haunts me every day, I live in misery
Without you, I have nothing but our memories
Life's a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Now I'm so confused on where I need to be
Searching for the answer, but it's plain to see
We weren't meant to be, oh
Baby, I'm just tryin' figure out how you could be so
Reckless
Stole my heart and put it on a necklace
Wind back the clock, baby girl, time is precious
Now I know that loving you's a death wish
Tell me how it feels to take advantage of love
Restless
Your voice inside my head, the echo endless
Let down my guard, every time I regret it
Even though I know you were pretending
When I said I loved you, I meant it
