Song Name: Sick and Tired (ft. Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker)
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in the drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Lately I know I've been a punk and I need to sober up
Double cup it got me stuck, I think I'm losin' it (yeah)
'Cause every time that I've been gettin' stuck (I'm stuck)
Got a lot inside my head (my head)
All my friends out there been dead, since I made it out
It's every time, that you cross my mind
Remember the times but I know that you won't ever change
I'm not sober enough, sick and tired of love
If you draw that line, bae, I hope you know I'm crossin' it
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in the drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's hard to wait
I get drunk and interrupt 'til my eyes look red
Because I'm mad at myself, I stab the openin'
Lately everything I say, you just tell me it's wrong
I told her "I won't be here long, I can't hold it in"
Every time, you cross my mind
I brought another memory to keep your's inside
I saw us, drown like hightide
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in the drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's hard to wait
Oh, oh, oh-oh woah (yeah)
Oh-oh woah, oh, oh (oh woah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh woah
Oh, oh, oh-oh woah mhm
