Song Name: Lemonade (Feat. Roddy Ricch & Don Toliver) [Remix]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag (ooh-ooh)
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh-ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money, it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey
Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped a coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin', yeah
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Why? (Yеah-yeah-yeah) Why?
Why you wanna waste my timе?
I can tell you really hate your life
Bitch, your watch the same as mine
(Oh, oh, yeah) I can't relate
Designer frames, I'm blind today
(Oh-oh) I'm never late
The money callin', you needed space
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag (ooh-ooh)
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh-ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money, it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey
Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped a coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin', yeah
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Yeah, this codeine got me trippin' (codeine got me trippin')
Wish it was over, I've been rollin' for a minute
I got the broad, she want the ménage inside the pla-a-ace
'68 Charger, duckin' the laws, I might do the ra-a-aid, huh
I like to ride in my new bag and I got a new bitch in my lap
Counting up the blue strips with two straps, yeah, yeah
Huh, slide in the Lambo', I slide in the Porsches
Huh, check my garage, I got too many choices
Walk around, got a couple mill's stuffed in my bag
Stripper hoes all in my Rolls shakin' they ass
Huh, we just ran a tab up at Nobu
You said that you never got high, I'ma show you
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh-ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money, it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey
Off the juice (juice), codeine got me tripping (juice)
Copped a coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Hey, yeah-yeah
