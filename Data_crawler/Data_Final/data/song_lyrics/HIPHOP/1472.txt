Song Name: Pyramids
Oh, oh, oh oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh-oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh-ohh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh-ohh
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Run, run, run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run, run, run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
We'll run to the future, shinin' like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze, and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
Voices fill up the halls
Oh, oh, oh-ohh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Ah, ay, ayy
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh uuh
Underneath our legion's view
Ahh, ay, ay, ay
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you layin' down with Samson, and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams, Cleopatra
Oh, oh, ohh-ohh, remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Ooh, oh, our war is over
Our queen has met her doom
Ooh, no more she lives
No more serpents in her room
Ooh, no more
He has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimpin' in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playin'
Top floor motel suite, twistin' my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank, but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid, that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid, keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
You showed up after work, I'm bathin' your body
Touchin' you places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride, cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid (that's right)
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight!
