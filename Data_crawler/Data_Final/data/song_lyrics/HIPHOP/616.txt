Song Name: Fantasy
If I hold you tight
Will you be there 'til the end of the night?
Will you just pack up and leave before I wake?
Can you just be here? will you stay?
And if I love you right
Will you show me all the things you hid?
Someone tell me what's the point of love
'Cause I'm not winning nothing here with you
And I, I give up every time you breathe
'Cause you don't ever wanna be
You're just a fantasy to me
And you, I swear that you'll never realize
That you're the only thing that I believe in
I know that we'll get through the seasons
Give me all your love
Feels like you're an angel from above
You're the one that I've been dreaming of
Feels like you're the one, but I, I never know
And there's not a way to find out
I've been looking for a way, hoping that we'll shine
Now it's getting harder to keep in mind the peace in life
If I end up broken, I'ma hope I'm broken with you
I'm ok with losing peace if I lose peace 'cause you need me
Bring flowers to your eulogy, just tell me you're not using me
I'm sick of bitches fooling me, they always make a tool of me
You're better off just shooting me then letting me die cluelessly
And I, I give up every time you breathe
'Cause you don't ever wanna be
You're just a fantasy to me
And you, I swear that you'll never realize
That you're the only thing that I believe in
I know that we'll get through the seasons
