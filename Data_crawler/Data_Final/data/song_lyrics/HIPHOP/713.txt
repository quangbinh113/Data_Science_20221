Song Name: Things I Should Of Said
It's so, it's so easy
Living your life the way you wanna
It's so, it's so easy
Spending your nights the way you wanna (ay)
And I know that you got no one that does you like I do
And who you got right now can't fuck you like I do
And you got that type that I seem to like
And it feels like I missed my chance, so let's dance one more time
'Cause you might think you need someone brand new
Don't front like I'm not fucked up over you
You lost so much to me, don't know the truth
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yеah, I'm fucked up over you
You, uh
You might just think that you need someonе new
I fell in love with the thought of something true
I pulled my brakes and tried to play it cool
Infatuated, I waited for you
Yeah, holding on this stance, things I should've said
Thoughts racing in my head
You know what I did
Got nervous, so I fled
I left it where I left it, won't leave your side again
'Cause you might think you need someone brand new
Don't front like I'm not fucked up over you
You lost so much to me, don't know the truth
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
You, uh
