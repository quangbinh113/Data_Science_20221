Song Name: Eastside (with Lil Tjay) - Remix
This gon' be my last time
I give my heart to the heartless
Fuck I look like being brokenhearted
Knew this shit would end just as soon as it started
I'm coolin' regardless
I need a ride-or-die by my side
Thought that you was in it for life
But your pride
Grew up on the Eastside (Eastside)
Where my enemies are friendly, I had to realize (realize)
They be at yo' neck, I gotta cut ties (cut ties)
Why is something real so hard to come by
On the Eastside?
'Cause I
I ain't got no love for you (I)
Middle fingers up to you, yeah
On the Eastside
A lotta shit be goin' on, you cannot know a bitch these days
Trust me, I done fucked a lot of niggas' jawns, if I talk about it you would be amazed
I can't go, yeah, I know
Someone might look like it's perfect and glazed
But I still daze thinkin' about the fades they get into when they not ready to go
I ain't got the time, millies on my mind
Fuck I look like? You gettin' in the way
I just got some new cheddar in today
I feel like I do better when you stay way far
Touched it and I raised the bar
It's just the power of a star
Luxury cars
21, I'm with the stars
Ayy, fuck a bitch, I'm goin' far
Bitch, I'm the G.O.A.T, give niggas hopes
Step out the crib, I'm always up to par
Finessed my way to richy, then I pick a switchy, then I go and put on Audemar
Might as well shit, now it's my time
As long as my wrist shine, I'm fine
Everywhere drip down, I'm blind
People told it ain't many niggas my kind
I need a (I need a) ride-or-die by my side (by my side)
Thought that you was in it for life (for life)
But your pride (ah)
Grew up on the Eastside (Eastside)
Where my enemies are friendly, I had to realize (realize)
They be at yo' neck, I gotta cut ties (cut ties)
Why is something real so hard to come by
On the Eastside?
'Cause I
I ain't got no love for you (I)
Middle fingers up to you, yeah
On the Eastside (oh)
