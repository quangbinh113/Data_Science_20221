Song Name: My Time To Shine (feat. 42 Dugg)
Man, fuck that bitch, came back to my senses
Two-tone Chevy, came back to the Benz
S550, that's for Kenny, lil' bitch
Stop posting these niggas that's dead if we did it
I'm pulling up red cup shawty
Killing my haters, these niggas not dead enough for me
I don't want your bitch, lil' shawty ain't slick
She don't lick, she don't suck or give head enough for me
I got these big ass rocks
Flew her to the city, fucked me and my mans, she a big-ass thot
Thick-ass top
Sliding my tip in a rich-ass slick-ass mop
All of my niggas, we bucking, I don't even know the word ducking
Bitch, you got budget, I up it
She wanna fuck, too scary to touch it
Put black in her tunnel, I'm Harriеt Tubman
Got Maybach to Maybach, I'm balling on niggas
That's payback to payback on all of my bitches
I make them wait for thе plate
Bought me a car with a stick just to stall it on niggas
Bought me a new FN, shawty came, bought me a new best friend
Hit 'em both and didn't know they looked like twina
(Ho, holy fuck, I just fucked off her bredren)
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in 'em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up
(Fuck with me)
Bitch get off my dick (hoe)
Rich young nigga still turnt from the 6
Told y'all I could make a mil', I'm big youngin
Money, three, in hundreds
Fuck her, fuck her, once I get the head, it's fuck her
Doing this ten years straight like Mustard
Rose-gold Cuban on the neck, new money
I get a Richard Mille, nothing less than two hundred
Young dawg keep coming, I see you
Take something from me, get left
Shit, ain't worried now, get stretched
He ain't 'bout war
Bankroll on me, no fraud
'Least nine hundreds in card
Nigga, all my bitches sell large stuffing, fuck her
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in 'em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up
I don't wanna talk no more, it is my time to shine
Forty million dollar advance, nigga, it is my time to sign
Bitch, get the fuck out of my light, this is my time to shine, man
Shawty keep talking that this and that
Ya-ya-ya, lil' bitch, my time to shine, man
Niggas in trouble, now they paying me double
Fresh Air Force, couldn't pay me to scuffle
Dead Benjamin head sitting in the duffle
When they sent me upstate and I was getting in a tussle
Hopping on the PJ, going out to PF
Hopping out to London just to see Steph
Yeah, I know I'm young, but I could fuck you like a DF
Boy, you finna die, you take three steps
I was getting money out the league
Back when Lil P and Lil J and Lil Fresh
Was getting B&E and coming out the scene
Blue bill hundreds bitches coming out the jeans
Blue in that booby trap, fuck it, I redeem
Got my cash up, yeah, now a nigga thumbing through the green
Last song, told you that my face wasn't in it
If you caught a nigga cheating then fuck what it seem
Mojo back, bitch, ow, I might bring back Cristal
Might stop telling these niggas my moves
They taking my groove, bitch, how? Give that man back his style
That's my dawg and we still share clothes
He can rock my chain, let me bust that Rollie
One thing we don't argue about bitches
We ain't finna fallout about hoes
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in 'em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up
