Song Name: Rockstar Heart
Spending all that money at the jewelry store
If they ain't do it for you, then who they do it for?
Hoping that it make it more acceptable, woah (yeah-yeah)
Okay, Hellcats (okay) on hellcats
But this rental car get more mileage (yeah)
Finna sell the Maybach with no problem (yeah)
You know the backseat, it make them nauseous (uh-huh)
Copped the Rolls-Royce truck (yeah)
'Cause I felt like that bitch was gangster
Hand on neck, hand on frontal (ayy, don't get it twisted)
Sex too good to give it to strangers, yeah ('cause I be on my shit)
What if I threw in the towel? (Okay)
On this rapper lifestyle, be as normal as I can be (as I can be, yeah)
Take of these clothes, no jewelry (yeah)
Could you still see my rockstar heart? (Yeah) Yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
My rockstar heart, uh, uh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rockstar heart
You know, I never really been hating on all that jewelry (yeah, yeah)
And all that, I was chilling
But you know, I kinda felt like, you know
Don't, don't, don't, you now what I'm sayin'?
Don't, don't, don't, don't disrespect my mind, or
Under-underestimate me, you know what I'm saying
All this shit, I get all this shit (ooh, woah, oh)
I still feel nothin', I still feel the same
The next time we go in the jewelry store
You tell me if that bitch look like your friend (Rockstar heart)
You tell me how that shit make you feel
You done saved up hunnids off the ground and all that money
Go in the Gucci store you tell me that bitch don't like your friend
Praying on me, and I know
I know that's what we do
You know, this the shit a nigga always wanted, even when I was broke
And I bought a million, I bought a million dollar mansion
Spent all the time in my apartment
You know, I ain't been in that bitch since October
It's crazy what we do to feel accepted by society
You know, you know the older I get
The more I, the more I
