Song Name: On GOD (with YG & Tyga feat. A$AP Ferg & A$AP Rocky)
On God
Your diamonds don't dance like this
You ain't got no soldiers takin' no chance like this
On God
Now ain't nobody triller than this
Go anywhere around the world nobody realer than this
On God
I be nappin' in the Hamptons
I just got a architect to build a big a- mansion
On God
Now I'm ready for expansion
And my old b- left me but I swear I'm so handsome
On God I got in with the 9 millimeter
On God I'm in the red Lamborghini a two-seater
On God I'm at hard-bottom seats ain't sneakers
I need a bad -, half ho half diva
On God it ain't ever been no b- in me
I'm aggressive with these h-ain't no soft s- in me
N- know it's 397 plus 3
At the top who you see s-, me, me and me?
She wanna kick it after we f- I don't do kung-fu
If your friend'd bust down that'd mean you won too
If your friend'd bust down that mean you won too
If I whip the d-out b- what you gon' do?
I'm in the red coupe I call it soo-woos
I got voices in my head like "Soo-woo soo-woo"
Don't believe the hype these n- lie in the booth
I'm a good-lookin' rapper I ain't lyin' to you
On God
Your diamonds don't dance like this
You ain't got no soldiers takin' no chance like this
On God
Now ain't nobody triller than this
Go anywhere around the world nobody realer than this
On God
I be nappin' in the Hamptons
I just got a architect to build a big a- mansion
On God
Now I'm ready for expansion
And my old b- left me but I swear I'm so handsome
On God
Life's a beach hittin' licks like a lease
Gettin' licked like your teeth
Runnin' s- like the cleats
On your feet
Little bit
Little bitch want the threesome
Run a threesome then I'mma stab no repeat
On G-O-D they on my B-O-D
I'm with the AOD it's a G-O here we go
I'm G double O-D good I'm a OG
Three triple OG hold it down P-O-P
I can't stand a h- with no rhythm
I can't tell if the a- factual or fiction
I can't really tell if she twerkin' or twitchin'
How many of you h- out there really Christians?
On God have the fella pass the petition
Shorty learn to clean house like she pack for eviction
Learnin' for a class or a cast or audition
Change the forecast throw the cash on a b-
On God
Your diamonds don't dance like this
You ain't got no soldiers takin' no chance like this
On God
Now ain't nobody triller than this
Go anywhere around the world nobody realer than this
On God
I be nappin' in the Hamptons
I just got a architect to build a big a- mansion
On God
Now I'm ready for expansion
And my old b- left me but I swear I'm so handsome
On God
Big mansion chicks dancin' uh
Prayed for it and the sh- happened uh
Left Prada with 10 jackets uh
Bed solid and the mitch-matchin' uh
Sick and tired of the chit-chattin' uh
I been ballin' this is just practice uh
Blow 20 sorry Ms. Jackson uh
Went West and I went platinum on God
I'm back on my real YG
To put you n- in the pit like deodorant be
I done came everything I was chosen to be
How I'm at the dinner party with Hova and B
'Cause I'm bustin' door-to-door like Jehovah with thieves
And now my whole family be rolling with me
Made my mom my accountant
Little brother got talent
And my Uncle T. Verg handle security
On God
Your diamonds don't dance like this
You ain't got no soldiers takin' no chance like this
On God
Now ain't nobody triller than this
Go anywhere around the world nobody realer than this
On God
I be nappin' in the Hamptons
I just got a architect to build a big a- mansion
On God
Now I'm ready for expansion
And my old b- left me but I swear I'm so handsome
On God
Pray for me n- love and hate me bunch of Judas'
All this money make you evil I won't give in to it
Imitate my lifestyle but they ain't been through it
Think you know my plays re-route 'em Cam Newton
Factory Patek blood sweat tears yes
Buy your mom a house then we could talk then
I got four payroll I'm the big man
Ten toes never fold stick to the plan
New mansion gotta keep advancin'
Outlandish Maybach when I land it
Black bandit run up in here no manners
Gotta keep up with the pace like Indiana's
Leave 'em white in the face like the masked phantom
I'mma f- her all night 'til she can't stand up
Got the Bugatti and ran like the devil dancin'
And he keep tryna call I won't answer
On God
Your diamonds don't dance like this
You ain't got no soldiers takin' no chance like this
On God
Now ain't nobody triller than this
Go anywhere around the world nobody realer than this
On God
I be nappin' in the Hamptons
I just got a architect to build a big a- mansion
On God
Now I'm ready for expansion
And my old b- left me but I swear I'm so handsome
On God
(Jesus!)
