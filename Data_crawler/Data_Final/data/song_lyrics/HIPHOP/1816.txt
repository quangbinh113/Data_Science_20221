Song Name: Persuasive (with SZA)
She's so persua-, oh
She's so persuasive, that marijuana
She's so flirtatious, how does it feel to be you?
So persuasive, that marijuana
She's so flirtatious (keep it going), how does it feel to be you?
Feel like the feeling of a silk press, feel like I feel like I got new breasts
Feel like I feel like I needed rest
Feel it's the season I should let go, and that's the reason I'ma buy more
Feel it's the season I should fly solo
I'm so sedated, and she so persuasive
This isolation, so sweet, you could taste it
Wake-bake in the morning, moonlight, y'all be yawning
It's three in the morning, and I'm still performing
She's so persuasive (so persua-), that marijuana (marijua-)
She's so flirtatious (so flirta-), how does it feel to be you?
So persuasive (so persua-), that marijuana (marijua-)
She's so flirtatious (so flirta-), how does it feel to be you? (Keep it going)
How does it feel to be alive? Let me break it down 'til it feel right
How does it feel? I'm so aligned, and it's so
Devil himself can't kill the vibe, I would hate me too, better get in line
I can't control, it's the flow
It's hard, can't tell when to stop when I'm on one, oh-oh
How does it feel?
I'll be the boss, I paid the price (price)
Get up off my balls, I said it nice (nice)
Get up off that wall and change your life
Take you to paradise
She's so persuasive (she's so persuasive), that marijuana (that marijuana)
She's so flirtatious (so flirtatious), how does it feel to be you?
So persuasive (so persua-), that marijuana (marijua-)
She's so flirtatious (so flirta-), how does it feel to be you? (Keep it going)
How does it feel to be you, you?
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to be you, you?
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
She's a hard, she's a hard worker
She's so persuasive (she's so persuasive), that marijuana (that marijuana)
She's so flirtatious (so flirtatious), how does it feel to be you?
She's so persuasive (so persua-), that marijuana (marijua-)
She's so flirtatious (so flirta-), how does it feel to be you?
Oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
How does it feel to be you?
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
How does it feel to be you?
She's so persuasive, that marijuana
She's so flirtatious, how does it feel to be you?
She's so persuasive, that marijuana
She's so flirtatious, how does it feel to be you?
