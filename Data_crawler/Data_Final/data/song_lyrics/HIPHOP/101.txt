Woah now
Slow down
You thinking that you know now

Like woah now

Woah
Yeah, anything you ever need Imma do it for ya
If you ever need a place to stay I'll get a roof for ya
Maybe one day if I get the money I can go and buy a coop for ya
Better yet I'll get two for ya
Matter fact I'll get 3, 4, 5, 6 for ya
Coming through with the ten for ya
Gettin some things off my mind
What is you blind?
Dude that you with is just wasting your time
You're something special-
The type that deserve to be taken out
Not sitting at home with a guy that don't try
I'll get you steak, shrimp, and lobster
He'll get you Wendy's-
A medium drink with some fries
Being a 10 won't you rather be spending
Your love and affection on more than a 5
Talkin' like oh no, oh no
He's so, so, so
If you keep acting up
Imma just sit back
Imma let her take a L
Girl if you confused them Imma let him break it down
Girl don't you know that with me it's the truest
It ain't that hard to say: "Fuck it lets do this"
Being with him yeah that's useless
Yeah, yeah
Woah now
Slow down
You thinking that you know now
Don't know now
We'll keep it on a low now
Like woah now
I think he needs to go now
Woah
