Song Name: Trench Bitch (feat. Lil Durk)
Banger
I put my life on the line, I'ma break up with you, ho (It's over)
You been disrespectful, hope the crazy house come get you, ho
Pistol by the dresser, 'cause I'm sleepin' by my pistol, ho
I don't tongue wrestle when you speakin' on my bitches, ho
I can't put my bitch before my bro, 'cause my bro that's my bro
But my bro he gotta know, then he can't disrespect my ho
She ain't just no any ho, she some like my mind ho
Even though, she my side-bitch, I buy her Range Rover
Trench bitch, she don't give a fuck about rich bitch
And I keep my pistol in her purse, 'cause I can't risk it
Trench bitch, she know when I fuck, I ain't gon' kiss it
And she gave me all her niggas drugs, knowin' it's his shit
Trench bitch, she been gettin' money, she a trick, trick
And she get to swipin' with her friend, that's how they get shit
Trench bitch, she can't hold a secret, showin' my dick pick
My skinny bitch had took it, so I sent it to my thick bitch
She might stand up to them pussy niggas, but she go down for me
'Member days I did my work outside, she wouldn't vouch for me
She might cut her wrist off when she pissed off, 'fore she cancel me
I was on (?) with my dick out 'fore I found the beat
Hard body flow, I might send my bitch to bless the streets
I know my lil' bitch in the hood, she still wish she was next to me
Said she loved in me for real, but she ended up textin' me
She got a new booty, shit ain't work, she wish the best for me
I got a new bitch, I like her for real, she like baguettes to me
She might slime you out,
And she ain't worried 'bout no bitch textin' me
Bitch, I'm from the south and you
Ain't got worry 'bout no nigga testin' me
Told my mama "Whenever I pass, make sure my bitch next to me"
Trench bitch, she don't give a fuck about rich bitch
And I keep my pistol in her purse, 'cause I can't risk it
Trench bitch, she don't wanna fuck, I ain't gon' kiss it
And she gave me all her niggas drugs, knowin' it's his shit
Trench bitch, she been gettin' money, she a trick, trick
And she get to swipin' with her friend, that's how they get shit
Trench bitch, she can't hold a secret, showin' my dick pick
My skinny bitch had took it, so I sent it to my thick bitch
Yeah, she don't give no fuck about no rich nigga, yeah
They gon' spend some dollars 'fore they get wood, yeah
They gon' buy some bottles 'fore they sit wood, yeah
I'm gon' pop my collar like a pimp, nigga, yeah
They gon' get some for they what? Yeah
They gon' get some for they face
I'ma pimp my collar like a pimp, nigga
I'ma pimp my
