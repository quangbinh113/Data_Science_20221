Song Name: Alright
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
Cold nights on the block, so quiet you can hear a pen drop
Retaliation every time that fourth gen' pop
That glizzy barrel smokin', left his skin hot
Old heads been in it, they done seen the third gen' drop
Hereditary hate, we been in this for years
When a father have a son, he just give it to his
Designer stitched with a bullseye, that's just how we live
Put our life on the line 'til we ain't got one to give
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
Tell me, what's a vet to a G.O.A.T.? Let that settle in
I can't try to take advice from rappers that I'm better than
Won't attach to gimmicks, so our drama just for relevance
Street nigga with class, I'ma gangster, but I'm elegant
Catchin' rich vibes, hopin' I become a better man
Turn up on these haters, they can't take me out my element
When you tried to play me, you insulted my intelligence
Found out you the devil, had me thinkin' you was Heaven-sent
I know I'm not perfect, got a closet full of skeletons
He stuck in his ways, but hate the taste of his own medicine
I took guns to school, that Smith & Wesson in my Letterman
City full of murders, cops can't luck up on no evidence
Bunch of cold cases on my block, shit is treacherous
TTG a family, I'm gangin' with my brethren
Posted on the corner, duckin' jakes, narcotic peddlin'
Dope boy swag, but I'm no longer dealin' heroin
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
It's gon' be alright, it's gon' be alright
And where do you go when you lost all hope
And you wanderin' off to the dark side?
