Song Name: Vibes
Hah
Brrrah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, brrah
Bah, grrah
Bah (GOONTEX)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (yeah)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (yeah, ah)
I get the money and add it up, add it up, add it up
I take a Addy, I'm staying up
Her booty bounce on my stomach, I'm slayin' her (woo)
Trix is for kids, no I'm not playin' her
She think it's a game, that's why I've been playin' her
On my anime shit, they eatin' my fairy dust
Life is too bliss, and I'm too rich (woo)
Bitch, they say this shit is not fair enough
We not the same, baby, don't go comparin' us
We got all of the opps, cliquing and pairin' up (grrah)
All of these hoes not had a fair share of us
Make it rain on lil' bitty and these bitches get curious
Mask on, H2ODelirious
That bitch wanna build like Ferb and Phineas
They hate that I'm black, wish my parents had syphilis
When I went overseas, I fucked on an immigrant (grrah, grrah)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (yeah)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (fuck)
It's a vibe when that money comin' in (yeah)
