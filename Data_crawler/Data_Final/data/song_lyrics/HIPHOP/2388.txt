Song Name: Outta Time
Bitch, I'm running outta time, get out my fucking face, hoe
Want more money, money, money, I just want the Pesos
It's my first time getting high today
I be off the drugs, they ask me if I wanna die today
I was with my bitch, I asked her if she wanna die today
God-damn, I'm still going through a lotta things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just got the lottery
Lottery, lil' nigga they ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling me to drop, okay
They keep telling me to drop
Yeah, they know that I'm gon' get it bunk on top
Pour the lean sipping wok
You a fiend, you off rocks
Bitch, if you come into my crib, give me top
I just wanna rock out
Fuck all of 'em niggas what they talk 'bout
She say she up north, lil' baby, this shit going south
Had to get this money, go and switch the route
I just popped a upper but this shit keep going down
Shit keeping going down
Shit keeping going down
Shit keeping going down
I was with my bitch, I asked her if she wanna die today
God-damn, I'm still going through a lotta things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just hit the lottery
Lottery, lil' nigga they ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling-
I'm pulling up in a truck
You know my Glock, I keep it tucked
Back to back I bet on black, I spent like 50 on this bus
And I know these niggas fake, I know they fold, they camouflage
So when 'em coppers come around
We turn 'em cameras off
I wasn't tryna hurt your feelings, I was tryna ball
Why you stressin', why you fussin'? I can't talk at all
Nowadays, it really seem like we don't talk at all
And when 'em choppas get to bussin I can't call at all
Bitch, I'm running outta time, get out my fucking face, hoe
Want more money, money, money, I just want the pesos
This my first time getting high today
I be off the drugs, they ask me if I wanna die today
I was with my bitch, I ask her if she wanna die today
God-damn, I'm still going through a lotta things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just hit the lottery
Lottery, lil' nigga they ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling me to drop, okay
