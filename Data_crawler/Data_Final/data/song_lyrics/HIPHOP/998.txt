Song Name: No Time (feat. Lil Durk)
D-Diego
I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah (cha, cha)
I stay focused on my trip, crew flyin'
You stay lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit, you say I can just read your mind
Zero buy-ins, I stay shinin'
Ain't no dimming over here
I don't go to panic for that interview
I can call whenever for that rendezvous
Fill the room, I got presence
And I never came in with a thing in a village
Where the only thing that they hear is me
How can they cancel, when the only thing that made me was me?
Been gainin' titles since a teen
René Duprée, and bitch, I'm still here
Standin' like a Pando tree, bitch, I am OP
I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah (cha, cha)
I stay focused on my trip, crew flyin'
You stay lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit, you say I can just read your mind
Zero buy-ins, I stay shinin'
Ain't no dimming over here (yeah)
I put that shit on I be gettin' from these owners, I be fly as hell
I give bro'nem hope about they out-day even though it's far as hell
I fly different bitches out to hang, I got three spots to chill (yeah, yeah)
Ain't gon lie the way this K blast, I got 'em on for real (let's get it)
Put down the Drac', I turn this Glock to a fully auto, uh, uh (yeah, yeah)
Gucci headband on my head like Leonardo, uh, uh (yeah, I don't want)
Took a pint and two FN's when I went to Capo (went to Capo, uh)
I was gettin' head on the jet, she playin' Mulatto (uh, uh)
Made it out the mud, came from nothin', I'm a thug (yeah, yeah)
Never ask for a second chance (yeah, yeah)
I'ma go ouside and jugg (nah, nah)
Perry Ellis sweatpants with a hundred thousand in the club (club)
Surrounded by the same motherfuckers from my hood, I'm good
Don't take my time for granted
You seen the start to where I'm at, you know that I'm about it (ooh)
I'm changin' views, there's nothing you can do
And I believe in my crew
I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah (cha, cha)
I stay focused on my trip, crew flyin'
You stay lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit, you say I can just read your mind
Zero buy-ins, I stay shinin'
Ain't no dimming over here
