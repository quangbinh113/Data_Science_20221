Song Name: Matinee
Ooh, I been drinkin' all night
Drop it in ya jaw, right now
Pop yo' shit, it's alright, oh
Poppin' out like pss smoke, pshh
Droppin' off yo' hoe
At your crib, later on
At your crib, later on
I been drinkin' all night (huh)
And I'm smokin' alright (hm, oh)
St. Louis to Shanghai
St. Lucia, can't lose, we loose, we Goose'd up, baby
My baby do it like she tryna pay her rent
(Ooh-woo, ooh-ooh-woo)
East L.A., live in the Wood, I feel like Clint
(Ooh-woo, ooh-ooh-woo)
Ayy, I know the whole world just a matinee
But pull down your mask, hit this gas wit' me
Yeah, huh, hold it
Puff that stuff, now hold it
Got 20 chickens on the phone, I feel like Tony
I wanna take you to the crib, I wanna own it
I wanna hone it, I wanna bone, damn
Pray somebody tell her I'm a grown man
I romanced her, I enhanced her
Diamonds dance in the Tesla, "Electric Slide," get it?
I don't text her, let it fester (it's the truth)
I don't stress her, I just stretch her (like I do, ayy, ayy)
I'm a wrestler, Broccoli Lesnar (ooh, ayy, ayy)
And he clever, call me Trevor
If it's cold, I Moncler her, make no error
I'm the gold, I'm the treasure, I'm a rare bird, oh
I been drinkin' all night (I been drinkin')
And I'm smokin' alright (got me thinkin')
St. Louis to Shanghai
St. Lucia, can't lose, we loose, we Goose'd up, baby
My baby do it like she tryna pay her rent
(My baby do it like she tryna pay)
East L.A. up in the woods, I feel like Clinton
(Ooh-woo, ooh-ooh-woo, huh)
Divas, digits and dollars, pro'ly won't ever change
If I do, I put it in cup, like, "Glad you came"
Mike Jones, yeah, we tippin', baby, you think I'm playin'?
Suck me, pay your tuition, thank me at graduation
I really can't fuck up on the mission
Time cruise by, gotta get shit now
Straight to the biscuit, soon as I wake up and I, I, I
I'm so fly, I flew, I'm so high, I'm who?
Light on my feet like a moth, I'm a mo'fucka
St. Louis gotta show me what's up (aw, yeah)
I heard Chicago got the shit sewed up (aw, yeah)
I heard Atlanta got some big ol' butts (aw, yeah)
Louisiana got some big ol' butts (aw, yeah)
Houston, Texas at the Turkey Leg Hut (ayy, ayy, Turkey Leg)
Dallas, Texas, meet me at the bazaar (right over there, uh)
I like L.A., they let me smoke at the bar (aw, yeah)
D.C. wit' a lil' chocolate bar (aw, yeah)
St. Louis gotta show me what's up (aw, yeah)
I heard Chicago got the shit sewed up (aw, yeah)
I heard Atlanta got some big ol' butts (aw, yeah)
Louisiana got some big ol' butts (aw, yeah)
Houston, Texas at the Turkey Leg Hut (ayy, ayy, Turkey Leg)
Dallas, Texas, meet me at the bazaar (right over there, uh)
I like L.A., they let me smoke at the bar (aw, yeah)
D.C. wit' a lil' chocolate bar (aw, yeah)
