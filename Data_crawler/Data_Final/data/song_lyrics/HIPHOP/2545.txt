Song Name: My Body (feat. B.O.G. Vonnie)
Got new shoes on the ride (yes sir)
Rollin' down '95 (yes sir)
And you can see in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutiepie
Wear it out
Wear it out (let's go Markel)
Wear it out
Wear it out
Wear it out
Yeah
I love a girl that keep my mind racing
I could tell it's good just off your conversation
Yeah, I'm not stoppin' till you're mine, baby
Tryna hit you with that nine, baby
Why would we wait, that's only time wasted
She was a good girl
She barely go to clubs
I changed her life now she like fuckin' on a thug
Bitch bad, I'm on her skin just like Dove
I told her she my light, I'm tryna leave it on her butt
Got a bad bitch in my ride (yes, sir)
Rolling down 95 (yes, sir)
And you can see it in her eyes (yes, sir)
That she don't ever want another guy (yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes, sir)
We can just cuddle up (yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes, sir)
Damn it, I'ma beat it up (yes, sir)
My body, your body
My body, your body
My body, your body
My body, your body
That outside dick keep them hoes sick
CashApp or Zelle, he know I'm jumping on it
That outside dick keep them hoes sick
CashApp or Zelle, he know I'm jumping on it
Baby got it on, she quick to take it, she don't need it (jumpin' on it)
Plus, her credit good, she a keeper (jumpin' on it)
She might flirt, but, she ain't fuckin', she a teaser (jumpin' on it)
She like to take her time, she a Libra (jumpin' on it)
Yeah, I'm in the water, got it bustin' like a bubble
She want feelings, she won't slide like a rubber
I got a girl, but, that ho worth the trouble (he got a bitch)
He want you bad to be fuckin' undercover (but, I ain't worried 'bout her)
Worried 'bout her
Worried 'bout her
Worried, worried, worried 'bout her
He got a— Worried 'bout her
Worried 'bout her
He got a— Worried 'bout her
Got a— Got a— Got a— Got a— Got a—
Got a— He got a bitch
But, I ain't worried 'bout her
I got a bad bitch in my ride (yes, sir)
Rolling down '95 (yes, sir)
And you can see it in her eyes (yes, sir)
That she don't ever want another guy (yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes, sir)
We can just cuddle up (yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes, sir)
Damn it, I'ma beat it up (yes, sir)
My body, your body is burning
My body, your body is burning
My body, your body is burning
My body, your body is burning
Jumping on it
J-J-J-J-Jumping on it, jumping on it
J-J-J-J-Jumping on it, jumping on it
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Jumping, jumping, jumping on it
J-J-J-J-Jumping on it, jumping on it
(He got a bitch but I ain't worried 'bout her)
(He got a bitch but I ain't worried 'bout her)
