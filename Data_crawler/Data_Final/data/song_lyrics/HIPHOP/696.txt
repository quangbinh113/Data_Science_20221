Song Name: Lithuania (feat. Travis Scott)
Bitch, I'm back and it's a PSA (woah, woah)
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA (fleek)
I know we met today but I'ma need that shit today (straight up)
Might go extra-extra just so I could see they face (Hit-Boy, straight up, damn)
Keep X's and O's in interchange, yeah (ooh)
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row all down my fingers (ooh)
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania (ooh, oh)
Pats, do you mind? (yeah) One of a kind
Get you to sign (to sign), I took the fine (yeah)
Mulholland Drive, I hesitate and weave
And hit that line, I hit more, say the least (lit)
Got to stacks to side, keep that for bro and peeps
With all the rhymes (straight up), risk it
And a nigga tell you risqu√©, lil' hoes keep tryin'
By the end of the day, my M's gettin' wired
My own rounds for every round we tried (Yeah)
I'm sensei, senseless, same time
Two drank, two cups poured up
I'm insanely down, slowed up
(She built round, butt bubbled up)
Don't inflame me now, go nuts
I keep flame right by my guts
It was out but now its tucked
Know back home they proud of us right now
Bitch, I'm back and it's a PSA (Woah, woah)
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA (fleek)
I know we met today but I'ma need that shit today (straight up)
Might go extra-extra just so I could see they face (straight up, damn)
Keep X's and O's in interchange, yeah (ooh)
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row all down my fingers (ooh)
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania (ooh, oh)
(Psycho, woah, woah)
Lil' bitch, don't talk to me like I'm not me (no)
Graveyard, up late, shit, I'm with the zombies (up)
Goin' insane, hard to contain
Can't miss a beat, my heart is not the same
You know it's flame if I'm in this hoe with Scotty
Long list of problems, long list of blessings
Making sure the first one never out-weight the second, yeah
Military with the tactics, multi-millions, multi-facet
She like Prince and Michael Jackson
Purple Rain and mirrors dancin'
Savage Fenty matching with the lingerie socks
Didn't know they made them 'til I took 'em off and I popped
Her momma 60 but look 29 and that's a great sign
Could take over any tri-state without even trying
And I'm prayin' for my ex's and my enemies (straight up)
'Cause they gon' need all the help they can get if it isn't me (I swear)
Success is a chain reaction, I'm the fuckin' missing link
In the world where niggas would do anything for everything, damn (damn)
Keep X's and O's in interchange, yeah (woah)
Hit three in a row, that's just a game (game, bitch)
Big rings in a row all down my fingers (woah)
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania (ooh, oh)
Yeah
I had to reset it, my credit on better and go 'head and vet it
I pullin' her head, talkin' shit and, yeah, I got a lil' fetish
