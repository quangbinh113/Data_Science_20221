Song Name: Faster
Thinkin', and thinkin', and thinkin', and thinkin'
Hmm, yeah
Thinkin', and thinkin', and thinkin', and thinkin'
Yeah
Faster (why you playin' faster?)
I know that you drinkin' and thinkin'
Girl, why you movin' faster? (slow down, watch yourself, babe)
You don't gotta live with this feelin', so shawty come do better
My vibe, I could keep your head up
I got mine, got no vendetta
Long clip, I don't need no tether (oh, oh-oh)
If you waste my time, I might need extra
I see they still tryna catch up with us (oh, oh-oh)
Oh, why they can't catch us?
All these bitches, they be askin' questions (oh, oh-oh)
I ain't no professor
Bobby in my Benz, I got Molly in my lens
I might link up with some 10's
Hold up, let me call my friends
If my gang win, then I win
If I win, then my gang win
I need cash when I make ends
And I need checks when I make M's
My shit pays, but they gon' copy
I told her "Chill", but she wan' top me
You are not accomplished, please don't try me
I guess that's some he'll figure, Tommy
I'm with the gang, not with the posse
You was a lame, then you not around me
I got a prize, you got a bounty
I was the one who runnin' the county (county)
Things change when you gettin' your cake up (ayy)
'Member when they said you changed up 'cause you not doin' favors? (Ayy)
I don't even wanna link no-one, I don't even wan' say none (ayy)
All of this shit, yeah, I been doin', and they chose not to say none
Oh, now you livin'
Faster (why you playin' faster?)
I know that you drinkin', and thinkin'
Girl, why you movin' faster? (Slow down, watch yourself, babe)
You don't gotta live with this feelin', so shawty come do better
My vibe, I could keep your head up
I got mine, got no vendetta
Long clip, I don't need no tether (oh, oh-oh)
If you waste my time, I might need extra
I see they still tryna catch up with us (oh, oh-oh)
Oh, why they can't catch us?
All these bitches they be askin' questions (oh, oh-oh)
I ain't no professor
(Faster, yeah, uh)
(I know that you drinkin', and thinkin')
(Girl, why you movin' faster? Yeah, ayy)
(You don't gotta live with this feelin', so shawty come do-)
