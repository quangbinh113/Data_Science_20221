Song Name: Belly of the Beast
Blowin' up my phone, you know I'll never pick up

Blowin' up my phone, you know I'll never pick up
I'm on my own, I'm smoking dope, I got some liquor in my cup
Can't break my heart, it's made of chrome, I'm just too in my zone
I tried to warn her ass before, but she ain't leave me alone
I'm in a C63 going 125 then I open my eyes I can't believe I'm alive still
Know you saved my life but we both gonna die still
Don't see where I'm going 'cause I'm rolling on five pills
Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass he was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level it's somewhere that you ain't never gon' be
Talk to me, gotta watch your tone bitch
I could cut you offer quicker than a fuckin' lane switch
I could put you on, but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet
Show me a sign if you hear me
I was really on, now I've grown so weary
I could see your face, but I'm staring at the ceiling
I could feel your touch, but you ain't even near me
I could see better when the lights turn off
I could do better, so I wrote this song for you
Black and white leather and I'm smashing on the pedal
Back to back Benzes now I'm moving presidential
Ice on my neck should have a price on my head
I've been up a couple days, I'll go to sleep when I'm dead
I got a lot up on my mind while I had so much I said
I got a lot up in this cup, you take one sip and you're dead
Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass he was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level it's somewhere that you ain't never gon' be
Talk to me, gotta watch your tone bitch
I could cut you offer quicker than a fuckin' lane switch
I could put you on, but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet
