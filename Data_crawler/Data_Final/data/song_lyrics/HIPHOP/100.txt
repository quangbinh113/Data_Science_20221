Song Name: Gucci Flip Flops (feat. Lil Yachty)
30 you a fool for this one (Cheeze)
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off the clock)
Bhad Bhabie got these bitches bustin' for cash (For cash)
Do the dash, try to play me, bitch, I'm bustin' yo' ass (Bustin' yo')
Lotta gun sounds, Rollie, bust down, know why these bitches mad?
'Cause they trash and they fuckin' for cash (Cash)
Too official, blow the whistle, bitch, I'm fly as a bird (Brrr)
Take a picture, get ya issue, bitch'll die on my word (On my word)
Walk in the bank, fuck it up
Pokin' that bitch with a shank, fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I bought the lil' bitch a bag
Make it double back and clear up her tab (Yah)
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch (Lil Boat), diamond drippin' off of the clock (Off the clock)
I got big guap, pussy, yeah, I'm real rich (Yeah)
Six cars, two houses and I'm still rich, uh
Think it's sweet? One call, hit the kill-switch (Boom)
Boy, be cool, I ain't worried 'bout your lil' bitch, nigga
That lil' chain that you rockin', that's so little to me
Talkin' shit but want a verse, that's a riddle to me
Can't fuck the bitch if she got her virginity (Hoo, yeah)
'Cause then she gon' really be into me (Hoo, yeah)
.223 shells in my ride for the enemies (Uh)
Put a few holes in his kidney (Hoo, Lil Boat)
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamond drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamond drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)
