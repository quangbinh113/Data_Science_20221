Song Name: Vision
White clouds blowin' out when we maxin'
.45, not the size, but it kick up (Kick up)
Highlight of my life, main attraction
Squat down, work it out, make it sit up (Sit up)
Your world, controllin' it, watch what happen
My world, on my finger, I just spin it (Spin it)
Hood girl, but gettin' paper as a passion
Collect the stacks and bring it back, man, that take vision (Vision)
White clouds blowin' out when we maxin'
.45, not the size, but it kick up (Kick up)
Highlight of my life, main attraction
Squat down, work it out, make it sit up (Sit up)
Your world, controllin' it, watch what happen
My world, on my finger, I just spin it (Spin it)
Hood girl, but gettin' paper as a passion
Collect the stacks and bring it back, man, that take vision (Vision)
White clouds blowin' out when we maxin'
.45, not the size, but it kick up (Kick up)
Highlight of my life, main attraction
Squat down, work it out, make it sit up (Sit up)
Your world, controllin' it, watch what happen
My world, on my finger, I just spin it (Spin it)
Hood girl, but gettin' paper as a passion
Collect the stacks and bring it back, man, that take vision (Vision)
White clouds blowin' out when we maxin'
.45, not the size, but it kick up (Kick up)
Highlight of my life, main attraction
Squat down, work it out, make it sit up (Sit up)
Your world, controllin' it, watch what happen
My world, on my finger, I just spin it (Spin it)
Hood girl, but gettin' paper as a passion
Collect the stacks and bring it back, man, that take vision (Vision)
Vision
Ooh, lie, lie, lie for me
Ooh, lie, lie, lie for me
Ooh...
