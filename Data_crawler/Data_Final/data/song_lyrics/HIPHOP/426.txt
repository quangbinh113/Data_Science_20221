Song Name: Bussdown (feat. Offset)
Oooh
Blueface baby (Blueface baby)
Yeah, aight
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Used to ride the bus down (Skrr)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Ice)
I just made six like a touchdown
I need it all when I touch down
Used to ride the bus down (Hey)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made 6sixlike a touchdown (Brr)
I need it all when I touch down
I used to roll in the metro (Metro)
Rollie Bussdown like the metro (Bussdown)
Million dollar cars off the metro (Metro)
I used to shop off the let go (Let go)
Now I go shop just to let go (Let go)
I ain't never had a school award (Never)
Spent fifty thousand on a watch (Watch)
And it came with a appraisal (Ooh)
Put a hole in a nigga (Bang)
Now he looking like a bagel (Bang)
How could I ever go broke (Never)
If Cash Money is the label? (Weirdo)
Bleed the block in a mini van (Bleed 'em)
Like I came and fixed the cable, man
Ain't it a great feeling? Damn
Beat the odds now, I get paid for the evening
Used to ride the bus down (Skrr, woo)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made six like a touchdown (Six)
I need it all when I touch down (I need that)
Used to ride the bus down (Woo)
Now I wear a Bussdown
I just made six like a touchdown (Brr, brr)
I need it all when I touch down (Offset)
Bussdown Cuban, fuck it, bust the Uzi
Smoking on a cookie and I made the air polluted
I can feel the whole hundred racks in the Ksubis (Racks)
I've been getting money since a young nigga Juvie (Hey)
Look at how I drip, Austin Powers, groovy (Look it)
12 get behind me, bust a left, then a U-ey (12)
Diamonds get to hitting and they splashin' on the Louis (Splash)
Thick bad bitch on the 'gram and I flew it (Bad)
Bussdown a watch, I'ma bust down your thot (Woo)
Thirty round Glock cause a nigga tryna plot
Lamborghini drop-top flexing on a opp (Flex)
I'm a walking zombie when I'm sippin' on the wock (Wock)
Trapping out the bando (Bando)
Get the work, make the profit, buy a Range Rover (Profit)
When I got my first mil' it was game over (Game over)
Had to go and pop the ceil' now the pain over (Hey)
Used to ride the bus down (Bus down)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made six like a touchdown (Touchdown)
I need it all when I touch down (Touch down)
Used to ride the bus down (Bus down)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made six like a touchdown (Touchdown)
I need it all when I touch down (Touch down)
I need half upfront (Right now)
The other half when I touch down (Touch down)
Can't do nothing without the backie (Back end)
They just want me in the backie (Backie)
Keep sticks on me like a caddie (Ooh)
But you will never catch me lacking (Never)
I pulled up in a big Benz (Big Benz)
I keep a stick like an old man (Old man)
They just want her a rich man (Rich man)
I'm in the area like Richmond (Richmond)
Always had me a vision
But this ain't That's So Raven
Bitch I fly like a raven (Raven)
I'm Baltimore like the Ravens (Ravens)
Chopper make a nigga breakdance (Breakdance)
Paint his brain on the pavement
Used to ride the bus down (Bus down)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made six like a touchdown (Touchdown)
I need it all when I touch down (Touch down)
Used to ride the bus down (Bus down)
Now I wear a Bussdown (Bussdown)
I just made six like a touchdown (Touchdown)
I need it all when I touch down (Touch down)
