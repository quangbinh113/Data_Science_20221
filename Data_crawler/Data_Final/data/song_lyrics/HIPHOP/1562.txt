Song Name: Detox
(Young Nick Papz, make it slap)
I been on the road, I'm gone
Private jet for me and the bros
Hit H. Lorenzo pick up clothes
I made a finsta to hit my hoes up
They don't know what I'm on, I'm on one
It ain't 'bout right now, it's the long run
I been actin' way too humble
Graduated the streets with honors, I
Cashed out with all blue hundreds, I
See through that cap, shit cut it out
Way too young and turnt to settle down
I built niggas up that let me down
World know I take care of everybody
They can't keep a tab on my whereabouts
Actin' like it's smoke, we gon air 'em out
Turn them niggas' crib to a scary house
Roll me up one
Tell my chauffeur, pull my car up to the driveway
Wake her up, tell her her ride ready
Gotta get my day going
The majority of this shit, I can't show 'em
How I'm movin' like I got eight arms
Tryna get my hands in everything
I like money, I don't cherish fame
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doin' somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P, these hoes so embarrassin'
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doin' somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's p, these hoes so embarrassin'
One life, two kids, three houses, four gang, five hundred for a show
Six rings, MJ, seven days, niggas weak, eight cars, I don't drive
Nine times out of ten, I'ma be the one to win
Runnin' up a lot of shit, gotta get 'em 'fore the summer end
They play fake crazy, I don't bar that
You just got turnt, don't start that
I just gotta call it how I call it
All of us stiff, we don't wanna talk
Key to the streets, I unlocked them
She fuck good but she toxic
Everybody lit when we pop out
Narcs think we sellin' narcotics
In staff meetings talkin' 'bout the artists
Business savvy like I went to college
Black car, Goyard wallet
Money clean, IRS can audit it
I still feel like I ain't where I oughta be
Every day I'm workin' gettin' closer
I'ma put the team on my shoulders
Boss bitch shit, she a grown up
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doin' somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P, these hoes so embarrassin'
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doin' somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P, these hoes so embarrassin'
