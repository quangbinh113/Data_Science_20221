Song Name: Body & A Face
Body on the blick, almost threw it in the lake (in the lake)
But I like the way it spray so I kept it on my waist
You know how I stay, you know how I stay
And I like my bitch with a body and a face
Body and a face, body and a face
Baka Not Nice, I'll shove it in your face
Late night I go place
Lost a little weight, so you know she wanna taste
Rolling VHS, what that mean is that I'm taped
'Case I gotta get another nigga out the way (yeah, uh)
Diss the boy and I'ma-
Diss the boy and I'ma make you pay the fee for it (yeah, what?)
Diss the boy and I'ma
Diss the boy and I'ma shoot whatever nigga made the beat for it (what? Yeah)
You know how I stay
City getting hot so he flew me to L.A
Now I got a Matshuhisa dinner on my plate
I just hugged Adele with a .50 on my waist
Yeah, yeah, you know how I stay
And I like my bitch with a body and a face
Body and a face, I'm not from the A
But I got a hawk for a nigga acting brave
Don't make me dirty up the place
White chalk, yellow tape
You gon' have to meet your homie at the gates
When you go on tour, you gon' have to leave the states
And then it's face to face
Noreaga interviews will get you niggas laced
I don't wanna hear you try to tell me 'bout mistakes
Almost lit your show up but we couldn't find the place
But Drizzy put me in my place
Told me just to wait (what?), yolo estates
Shorty with the cakes, but she doesn't bake
Have you laying in the morgue just a body and a face
Hey, hey, yeah
Not Nice, niggas gotta know how the fuck did I pop twice
Niggas gotta know how the fuck did I copped ice
Niggas gotta know how the fuck
(What? What?)
Niggas gotta know I'm not hiding
Niggas gotta know thirteen years put the time in
Niggas gotta know how I'm mashing up the place
And I like my bitch with a body and a face
(Six...)
