Song Name: Coolest Things
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ayy)
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ayy, yeah, ayy)
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ah, ah)
The depth of perception
Big smile on my face, still goin' through depression
I'm running in place, but I keep on stepping
Quit asking me questions
No, I do not have a second for you, you not tryna help
I gotta switch up my methods
Shaking off my demons and countin' my blessings
Rushing for no reason and time's of the essence
I gotta chill for a second, don't wanna talk to nobody
I need to be by myself, yeah
I just feel like running away
But everybody want me to stay
I just feel like running away
But everybody want me to stay
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ah, no, no)
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (yeah, yeah, man)
Glitter, glitter, glitter, not gold' digging for glitter
I don't want it, I don't want it, I throw it away like litter
Pity, pity, pity, we having a pity party
I just dumped somebody daughter
I feel like I can come harder
Shed a tear if you wanna, but girl I gotta be honest
I almost had lost my confidence when you had broke your promise
Sure glad I wore a condom, you fucking 'round like yo' momma was
Back in her prime, quit wastin' my time, bitch
I just feel like running away
But everybody want me to stay
I just feel like running away
But everybody want me to stay
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ah)
(No, they ain't)
Sometimes the coolest things
Ain't all that cool at all (ah)
Fuck you too nigga, you a handful
You been DM'ing for weeks
Tryna get this pussy okay
I ain't like none of these other bitches
You fuckin' out here don't try to come-
Nigga now you tr-now you tryna act?
Okay, Oscar go-, the Oscar goes to
The Oscar goes to
(Ain't all that cool)
