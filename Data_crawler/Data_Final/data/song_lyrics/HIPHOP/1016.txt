Song Name: Double It (feat. Fetty Luciano)
(This is a Melo beat)
Hmm-mm-mm-mm, oh
I get it, then- (you niggas already know the vibe)
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it (hmm-mm-mm-mm)
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it
It's big Papi Locsta
Big racks only, when niggas step on the scene
Ain't nobody told ya?
Off the bracelet so I'm back to wildin' in these streets
Mr. spin in Rovers
Balmains and Gucci sweaters, hopin' out the V's
Mr. run you over
On ASAP, I up it ASAP and took yo' bih
I'm a trappin' fanatic (trappin' fanatic)
I walk in the spot like I want it all
Amiri jeans for the denim, hundred clip, he get him
Don't call it, who wanna ball?
Double G for the swag, you can check the tag
Flossy nigga droppin' G's
Big Benty for the V's, double G the T
Benjis bussin' out the jeans
I get it, then flip it, then double it
Big slips, we gon' walk 'em in
I pull up, a milli', got Ninas attached
535, I got treesh in the back
Say that's your mans, he is a rat
Can't fuck with these niggas, niggas is whack
Come to your block, give him a smack
Pull up TD, leave where he's at
Shawty, 40 (40)
Yeah, I've been wildin' since 14
Shootin' like Korver
Finesse like Corey, spin it, I'm on 'em, spinnin', we shootin' down Hawthorne
He be on my tail, like peanut butter
Windows is tinted, can't see nothin' (can't see shit)
I'm strapped with a laser if he want it (uhh-huh)
Put a bullet in your head and your femur (gang, gang gang)
Drillin' shit now (drill)
Grippin' them shells, hope these niggas don't tell (sshh)
'Cause I am not seein' no cell (no cell)
'Cause Pop Smoke got my bail (he do)
I get it, then flip it, then double it
Nine to the floss when we comin' in (nine to the floss)
We where them hunnids at
No, we ain't run with it
Nine to his bloods, now he tumblin' (baow, baow)
Put that lil' bitch on the shelf (on the shelf)
LV on my belt (we done)
Drippin' designer myself (I do)
I am not needin' no help (I don't)
Saucin' (saucin')
I'm on the molly, I'm nauseous (molly)
Don't play with the gang, precaution (gang)
Where is my mind? I lost it (I lost it)
Woo, saucin' (saucin')
Spin on these niggas regardless (gang)
Hop out and aim for the target (baow)
I used to play up in Target (in Sweden)
Woo (woo woo)
I used to trap out the garbage (the garbage)
I used to trap in the darkness (the darkness)
It's a Wraith, not a Charger (skrrt)
It's a Wraith, not a Charger (gang)
I get it, then flip it, then double it (double it)
Big slips, we gon' walk 'em in (big slips)
I pull up, a milli', got Ninas attached (skrrt)
535, I got treesh in the back
Say that's your mans, he is a rat
Can't fuck with these niggas, niggas is whack
Come to your block, give him a smack
Pull up TD, leave where he's at
Shawty
