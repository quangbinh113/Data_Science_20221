Song Name: I Got You (ft. Busta Rhymes)
Ha ha, no cap
I'm the one, not the two, ha ha
Uh, yeah
Yeah, fiendin' for your love every damn day
Put my love above, drive me insane
A little Hennessy, a lotta D'USSÉ
Baby, make a movie with me, Blu-Ray
Could've saved me from myself, but it's too late
Sorry for inconveniences and mood swings
Fly as fuck in Givenchy, sippin' Kool Aid, yeah (huh)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you (if you give it to me)
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you (you)
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you
Yeah, baby girl, you know you hit the target (huh)
Beautiful and sweeter than a box of Boston Markets (ha)
Put a stone on you like the diamond was west lost in the ark (aw)
You know you in the Bugatti at the way that you parked it
Respect my reflection or you better get (get)
My queen move with proper royal and prince etiquette (aw)
We blossomed together even when I became a predicate (shit)
Funny how we started off as friends with benefits (haha)
Everything white, she a perfectionist (oh, yeah)
And when she type about some shit, you gotta let a bitch (let a bitch)
We ride or die loyal, mommy'll never switch (never)
And build a empire together, love me forever, bitch, I got you
Yeah, fiendin' for your love every damn day
Put my love above, drive me insane
A little Hennessy, a lotta D'USSÉ
Baby, make a movie with me, Blu-Ray
Could've saved me from myself, but it's too late
Sorry for inconveniences and mood swings
Fly as fuck in Givenchy, sippin' Kool Aid, yeah (huh)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you (if you give it to me)
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you (you)
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you
Shawty, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
You know that I got you
