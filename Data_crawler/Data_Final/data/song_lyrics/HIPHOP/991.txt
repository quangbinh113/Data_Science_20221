Song Name: Bout A Million (feat. 42 Dugg & 21 Savage)

On my knees, for all my niggas bow, bitch
Blitz, Crips, fast, drop, rest the blocks
We still steppin', we still stretch shit
What's on me? A FN, a FN, a F&N
Took my bitch up out the Taurus, put her in a Benz
That bitch there ain't worth a quarter, I fuck with tens
Right after she said, "I couldn't", I fucked again
Earrings on me look like boogers, bitch, I'm worth some M's
21, bang, do whatever for the gang (on God)
Nudy gon' pop out with that stick and
I know that he won't say a name (ssh)
Buddy got put in a box
He came to the wrong hood lookin' for fame (pussy)
Ain't no secret, big 4L's, them fuckboys know what I claim (pussy)
Richard Mille, copped without a show-box (21)
Four-five, make you do the hold up (21)
Pop Smoke, gun smoke, same thang (same thang)
I'm on the block slangin' cold cuts (cut)
Say you got a body, nigga, so what? (21)
Terrorize shit, we got a whole bunch (bitch)
None of my opps ain't on nothin' (pussy)
Broke ass bitches got one gun (21, 21)
She get so wet and slippery (slippery)
She screamin' and yellin', "Put dick in me" (21)
Most of these jewelers is sick of me (21)
Savage spend money ridiculously (on God)
I ain't with all of the bickery (straight up)
They disappear, I know trickery (straight up)
He made a diss and it tickle me (on God)
I don't let bullshit get to me (21)
Switches on the Glocks, rest in piss to all my opps (21)
We treat beef like albums, nigga, all that shit get dropped (on God)
I ain't got no brain, I spent your budget on my watch (pussy, 21)
The cheapest ring on my body cost a hundred (yeah)
I got 'bout a million worth in jewels
