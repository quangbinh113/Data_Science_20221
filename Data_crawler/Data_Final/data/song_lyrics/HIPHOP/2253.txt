Song Name: What You Know
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Ay, don't you know I got key by the three?
When I chirp, shawty, chirp back
Louis knapsack where I holdin' all the work at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey, I know all about that
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey, what you know about that?
Hey, I know all about that
See me in your city, sittin' pretty, know I'm shinin' dog
Ridin' with a couple Latin broads and a China doll (Hey)
And you know how we ball (Hey)
Ridin' in shiny cars (Hey)
Walk in designer malls (Hey)
Buy everything we saw
You know about me, dog (Okay)
Don't talk about me, dog (Okay)
And if you doubt me, dog (Okay)

Don't you know I got key by the three?
When I chirp, shawty, chirp back
Louis knapsack where I holdin' all the work at
What you know about that?

Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at

Candy on the '64, leather guts and fish bowl
50 on the pinky ring just to make my fist glow (Hey)
Your bitches get low (Hey)

So what I'm rich, hoe (Hey)
I'll still pull a kick door

And gotta run and get folk?
Got you yellin', I thought you put out a gun hit 'fore
But you's a scary dude (Okay)
Believed by very few (Okay)
Just keep it very cool (Okay)
Or we will bury you (Oh)
See all that attitude's (Oh)
Unnecessary, dude (Oh)
'Cause you never carry tools
Not even square he cube (What?)
