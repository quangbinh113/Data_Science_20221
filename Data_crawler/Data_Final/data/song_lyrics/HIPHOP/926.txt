Song Name: How It Feels
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)
(Section 8 just straight cooked that mo'fucker up)
I just put a Mansory kit on top of a Lamb' truck
I know how it feels to stay down and run you some bands up
Hundred grand on me, it's hard holdin' my pants up
TRX, the Hellcat motor inside a RAM truck
Real ones like me hard to come by, it's only a handful
Ain't no money in the world that make me give my mans up
I know how it feel to think everybody against you
I know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield
I know how it feel when you try your best to be real
I know how it feel when you think no one understands you
I know how it feel when the one you love gettin' ran through
I know how it feel, I done really cut off my mans too
I know how it feel when you broke, and them bills past due
Oh, you thought this shit was a joke? We on your ass too
I can't give my energy to anybody
I'm a billionaire in the making, I promise I'ma get one
Lil' bitch tried to chase me, I had to stiff-arm her
Only had a couple dollars, I was still gettin' fresh
I ain't tryna say I'm cocky, but I feel I'm the best
Every time, I want the maximum, ain't takin' nothin' less
I've been back-to-back jets, but I still fly Delta
Thick lil' shit, but she can fit in my schedule
Yeah, I'm always on the go, but I make time for that ass
Know I got a lot, but I'm on the grind, tryna get marriage
I know I be calm, but I'm nowhere near average
A hundred million dollars cold cash gettin' buried
Lookin' at the man I'm becomin', it's gettin' scary
All these bitches fuckin' whoever, who gettin' married?
I ain't tryna go back to nothin', I'm tryna have shit
I be quick to pick up that blicky, I got a bad wrist
I know how it feel to think everybody against you
I know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield
I know how it feel when you try your best to be real
I know how it feel when you think no one understands you
I know how it feel when the one you love gettin' ran through
I know how it feel, I done really cut off my mans too
I know how it feel when you broke, and them bills past due
Oh, you thought this shit was a joke? We on your ass too (smurk)
I know how it feel to have the killers tell you everything (yeah, yeah)
I know how it feel to wake up cut up from them bed springs (yeah, yeah)
I know how it feel not to eat, it give you head pain (yeah, yeah)
I know how it feel to talk to granny and forget everything (yeah)
I just sat in jail with a bond, couldn't bond out
I know how it feel to dodge scooters, smoke the garage out
I know how it feel, the bitch you love fuckin' bomb now
Rushin' while you cheatin', usin' water to get the cum out (yeah)
I know how it feel to use your brother to the trenches (trenches)
I know how it feel to get burnt 'bout some bitches ('bout some bitches)
Lyin' on some murders, actin' turnt like he did it
Slidin' on some niggas in a Demon, but lowkey, he a Christian (skrrt)
I know how it feel to get my mom a house
I know how it feel to pour a four right by Obama house
Tryna buy O'Block 'cause Von want it, but he gone now (gone now)
I know how it feel when you broke, but now I'm on now, on now (yeah)
I know how it feel to think everybody against you (yeah)
I know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield (yeah)
I know how it feel when you try your best to be real (yeah)
I know how it feel when you think no one understands you (yeah)
I know how it feel when the one you love gettin' ran through (yeah)
I know how it feel, I done really cut off my mans too (yeah)
I know how it feel when you broke, and them bills past due (yeah)
Oh, you thought this shit was a joke? We on your ass too
