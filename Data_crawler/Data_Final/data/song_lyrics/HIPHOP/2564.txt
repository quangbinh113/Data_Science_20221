Song Name: Still (feat. 6LACK and Smino)
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spinnin' for DMs
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to
She say, "I gotta be still, yeah, I gotta be still
Bare a cross right 'cause when
Life goin' right then they might wanna re-deal"
I say, "I wanna be here, but I got moves to make
There's so many people workin' for me nowadays
That I don't even know who I pay, okay"
I'm still right here beside you, gettin' sick of the costume
What's the real world?
When you with me, you take off your cool
Admittedly, yeah, I do too
I know I'm more elusive, but her grip never get looser
And that's why I don't wan' lose her
Ridin' 'round 90, windows down
I get reminded to slow down
I get a message, we up now
She go down with the boat now
I try to be profound, but you could get lost with me
I had to leave and put it on hold until you across from me again
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spinnin' for DMs
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to kill
High (high-high-high), high (high)
High (just as still)
High (high-high-high), high (high)
High (just as still)
High (high-high-high), high (high)
High (uh-uh-uh, mm-mm)
I hope you still got, hope you still got
And you still got my hoodie
Still have my car, still have my wallet
Still in that pocket, hope you don't call it
Pullin' my card, still where your momma live
Right off Parker road it's-
Still be callin' to me, she love me still
Got a bond still, so what's fuckin' real?
Discussion still, if there's somethin' still
Love a women still, got my gun inside of the function
Still young Shakespeare, no eraser
I wrote this verse in stone
Sculped the horoscope
I'm morse code, still tapped in with your hoe (with your hoe)
Smino touch the soul (soul)
I change actually when I'm in the booth
I eat it like baba ghanoush
Right by the lanes and right by the goose
I'm really just still into you
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spinnin' for DMs
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to kill
My mother's house, the glue that kept the family together
There's nothin' like y'all
People moved out of the city and the compact got vacated
We were always not more than
A half an hour from the house
