Song Name: Bruddanem (feat. Lil Durk)
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
If you my nigga, you my nigga then
Twin, thick or thin
I was a kid when my brother went in
Now he lil' brother to man
Kinda like Pac in Above the Rim
Couple Ms, cut a check, cut a film
I got the Glock for my bruddanem
I spin the block for my bruddanem
I did a lot for my bruddanem
You better watch for my bruddanem
You gotta watch my bros
I'm finna cop for my bruddanem
You call the cops on my bruddanem
You don't know, partner, them strugglin'
That shit ain't nothin' 'bout nothin'
And if my brother say, "Let's slide," well then, my sister slidin' too
It ain't no slippin' on this side, I got my grip and found my groove
And if they blitzin' on the squad, I swear to God it's bad for you
When there's nothin' else they thought I would do
My brothers ride through
My brothers ride through (yeah, uh)
My brothers ride through
Uh, look, uh (shit)
This for my brother, my hitter, my slugger
My nigga, my jigga, my killer, my dog
Here for the women, the women my niggas
Most of them really be realer than y'all
When I was little
Remember we literally can't forget all the shit that we saw
JaJa hit a nigga right in the jaw
We ain't jumpin', we just lettin' 'em roll
Every summer it was somebody dead and somebody scared, so nobody saw
Buddy in jail and somebody called
Collectin' the bail is somebody boss
Laid off, hm, stay in the bed
Hell nah, what the fuck you done did?
All that stressin' takin' care of the kids
(Give us somethin' that can take off the edge)
From the minute I got in trouble
Got a whippin' for nothin', that's somethin' my brother did
I never snitch, I never done no sucker shit
'Cause he'll hush for me if it was him
He'll bust for me if it was him
So you know it's all toes ten
When it come to my bruddanem
I'll whirlwind, spin your block again
(I got the Glock for my bruddanem)
I spin the block for my bruddanem
I did a lot for my bruddanem
You better watch for my bruddanem
You gotta watch my bros
I'm finna cop for my bruddanem
You call the cops on my bruddanem
You don't know, partner, them strugglin'
That shit ain't nothin' 'bout nothin'
And if my brother say, "Let's slide," well then, my sister slidin' too
It ain't no slippin' on this side, I got my grip and found my groove
And if they blitzin' on the squad, I swear to God it's bad for you
When there's nothin' else they thought I would do
My brothers ride
Ten millimeter, it's different
My brother had gave me one of his switches
My uncle be bitchin', they told me he snitchin', so when I grew up
I was blessed in my distance (oh, oh)
We slept by the window, bein' hungry a issue
Power knocked out, slept close to a window
My brother, my brother, sayin', "Mama, this real"
What I be sayin', this shit is official
I get rich, you get rich, I got rich, you rich now
Fucked the opps up so bad, they tryna establish a sit-down
But he can't sit, brrah! Buddy got hit, brraow!
Trench baby, street nigga, real niggas, real killers, gravediggers
Gang, gang, foenem block, all that shit really gang members
Fake Percs, he don't got no more
He said they feel like real painkillers
My brother a shooter, my brother a killer
Fuck politics, I'm with the same niggas
My brother gon' slide, but two of my brothers had died
Them was my main niggas, oh, oh
These niggas, street niggas, type to never leave niggas
Roll somethin', hold somethin', anything to disappear, nigga
Neck-deep in this water like glistenin' to be seen, nigga
I see you, I love you, do you feel it? We're still here, nigga
God gave us a war
And this sword can't be near niggas
You reach for it, you reach for him
You reach for these dreams, nigga
Two wraps on this durag
Two straps when we're out for dinner
Take care of your skin, take care of your liver
I won't let them in, I won't let you wither
I won't let you
