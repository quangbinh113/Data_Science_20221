Song Name: Only You Freestyle
(M1OnTheBeat)
Woi, yes
(M1OnTheBeat)
Yes, woi
Again and again, again and again, yeah
Yo, Chubbs might jam this yute for a chain
And give it to a sweet one, called that Maya Jama
Givin' out gifts like Santa, sippin' on Sanna
I used to do lean and wok
Closet filled up with designer, comin' like Panda, Panda
Yeah, gyal just came to the booth and asked for a wheel
She never heard Drill in Atlanta
Arabic ting told me that I look like Youssef, look like Hamza
Habibti please, أنا أكيد، إنت وأنا أحلى
With Pop Skull in Gaza but not that Gaza, but still it's a mazza
Niggas want a piece like cassava
But we let bridge dem burn like Grabba
Woi, four in the cliz and one in the headie
Hand no shake, man, hold that steady
Ya man love pose with the ting for picture
You man shoulda buss that ting already
Ya man love Hezi Hezi
Yeah, can't back chat to the Prezi
You know when the beef just taste like veggie?
Gyal go ritz for the mani, pedi
CC bag looks nice but the Birkin bag look way more heavy
That's just a big gyal ting, man, you get me?
Raemi just turned mommy and that's my sis so I just turn Abti
Fan mail came to the crib from a yute that loves me
I swear that touch me
I never even drive no whips I own so they all look way too dusty
If me and Gyalist go St. Michael
The gyal come way too fussy, crushy
Man said they would do this and that
But the man weren't really that wassy, was he?
Nah, nah, nah, the man weren't really that what?
1942, hits my system, man get way too frosty, buzzy
Girls from the past that lost me, love me
Same ones there that crossed me, cuss me
Everything come full circle, word to the boss above me
Slow stroking 'cause the bamski way too big
My gyal don't rush me
Woi, don't make me have to rise my rifle
Man try send some young boys for me
Don't make me have to ride by high school
Shit you man been droppin' lately
Don't make me have to fly my iTunes
So much people buy into my hype
Don't make me have to buy my hype too
Dealt with the big homie already
Don't make me have to side-by-side you
Nuff times he tried to hide behind you
Amnesia but when I remind you
I'm touchin' road and I can't find you
Word to the M-O-B, I'm tied to
I'm givin' up when I decide too, jheeze
One
(OFB, OFB, OFB)
Suh, suh
Suh, suh, suh, suh, suh, suh
Oh, how we hate leggies (Suh, suh)
How much points have the gang got? Many (One)
Didn't ever have to rise that dots
It was just under my bed and ready (Turn)
Bro bro chinged up a opp boy
I swear he got chinged already (They told me turn, uh)
That next one thought he was boss
Then he got shot, Nathan Tettey (They told me turn)
Got this bad b on Henny
My next one from yard love reggae (shawty)
We dishin' out store and telly
Then we in France running out Trezeguet (One)
She look sexy, sippin' on Henny
If it feels good, I'ma pass the penny (Suh, suh, suh, suh, suh)
She give headie, headie
My tracksuit Louis, now covered in Fenty
Used to put light in the cling
And it still didn't stop it, smellin' like petty
Got the dark in the blue, then we put it in the red, Balotelli
Them times it was M way (What?)
I mean M way, T house, M way, huh
North Penty, up top Penty, huh
Bentley, Range then Bentley, huh
Have you ever had your pockets empty?
But still found the bread to afford a trenton
Six litres flying through Epsom
I swear I've seen life from both perspectives
That spot so far upsuh, en-route, got no connection
I done run through so much Scottish notes
Couldn't care 'bout no recessions (One)
Still get one jail call from Boogie
Judge gave him twenty years straight, it moved me
CPS murder in the dock like Rupert
'Cah lil' bro went and dun him so ruthless
Got this cutie, she half Cuban
Probably why she like playin' with the Cuban
Says she like chillin' with the ooters, booters
Eating uptown all suited booted, booted, booted
They wasn't with us when the jeans were bootleg
Putting that work, we ain't never been spoon-fed
Comin' for the jungle, you know where the zoo is
.44 or the .32 auto bells, its a toothpick
No rap cap we just speak what the truth is
Lord forgive them, they don't know what they're doing
Shotgun, open the hatch, I put two in
Still ain't forgot how it feels to be losin'
They thought it was permanent, found it amusin'
All this drip on me like I'm canoein'
Time just flyin' (Huh)
I'm just tryna do the slide ting to my juvies, juvies
So the beef is fryin'
They tryna stop slidin', Toosie, Toosie
(One)
(Suh, suh)
