Song Name: Go Crazy (Remix)
Guess who's bizzack still smellin blow in my clothes
Like crispy cream, I was cookin them O's
Like horseshoes, I was tossin' them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional, I hug the block
I'm so emotional, I love my glock
Cash rules everything around me so whats realer
Buy the scrilla call me a ghostface killa
Its kinda hard to be drug free
When Georgia Power wont give a nigga lights free
Switch hustles, been killin em ever since
If it paid to tell the truth dog it'd only make cents.
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin
Doin my thing.
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All gangsta in the street
They be doin their thing.
By 18, the hard way
Have a humble nigga victim by gun play
Now who the fuck want to play with guns
A lot of hoes alot of bloods
Dog shit aint fun
So I suggest you dont play with my chain
I'll send these hollow jets let em play wit your brain
The streets is watchin, the name is warm
The product is white, a star is born
Listen Im so fly, take the parachute off
I might fall and die
Back to work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it out of town,
Call it safe sex.
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin
Doin my thing.
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All gangsta in the street
They be doin their thing.
I'm more than hustler, Im the definition of it
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than street legend, homie its Hova
More than a relief pitch, I'm the closer.
The Mariano of the Mariot
If money talks, the whole world bout to hear me out
See I'm a hustlers hope, I'm not his pipe dream
So when the speak of success,
Im what they might mean.
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hew is Jay Z blue.
Dont follow me youngin, follow my moves
I'm not a role model
A bad influence,
Got the world drinkin gold bottles.
When Puff was in that tub spillin Mo
I was at my video
Cris on a speed boat,
In My Lifetime nigga, go do your research,
St. Thomas my nigga, that was me first.
Chrome shoes to GS I came feet first,
In the game,
Like a baby born a breeched birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can king pin you a line a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cus I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like
"Na Hov talk that shit"
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay Z
See I'm a 80's baby
Mastered Reaganomics
School of hard knocks, everyday is college
You aint did nothin I aint did
Nigga pay homage, or pay the doctor
I spray llamas still
If time will reveal
You know I'm bein honest
Ya'l aint pull my coat yet
And I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades,
Cus your boy that bright.
Goodnight!
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin
Doin my thing.
When they play that new Jeez
All the dope boys go crazy
Watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All gangsta in the street
They be doin their thing.
