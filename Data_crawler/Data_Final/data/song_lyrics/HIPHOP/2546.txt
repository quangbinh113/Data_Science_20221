Song Name: Gotsta Get Paid
Feeling like fuck a bitch nigga
You and your bitch nigga
I'll make your eyes water with her mouth, wrist glitter
Pretty face and waist cincher
Don't call me your miss, mister (ew)
She don't want no blunt with me so she sent her big sister
Come and get the bigger picture
Lemonades in big pitchers
At a bitch like a real picture
Posted up on IG
Now they wanna come chill with ya
Laughing, cracking, sitting with ya
I ain't with the dickriding, rather eat a pig's liver
You the type to brag about it, I'm the type to laugh it off
Niggas out here actin' super hard, but dicks bе super soft
Bitches smoke my weed, now shе wheezing with the Covid cough
Smoke it off or don't smoke at all, motherfucker
Don't get in my way, I gotsta get paid (I gotsta get paid)
Fashionista shades like gyms, we move weights
Party like parades and wake up in a daze
No wonder why they wanna switch bodies and trade places
Don't get in my way, I gotsta get paid (I gotsta get paid)
Fashionista shades like gyms, we move weights
Party like parades and wake up in a daze
No wonder why they wanna switch bodies and trade places
These niggas ain't on shit, these bitches ain't on shit
Put the motherfuckers together, they kids ain't on shit
Fuck all them broke ass pussies, get you some money
'Cause motherfucker, best believe they gonna watch yo' ass
I'm drinking, I'm smoking, I'm twisted
This potent sticky, got me lifted
I'm switching my cars how I switch fits
Raising a bar, keep going hard
'Cause I gotta pay for my baby tuition
Always believing in my intuition
If you want issues, we grant you your wishes
I'm in the hills, but I came from the trenches
Walk in a trench coat
Ready to go, who wanna come get smoke?
Bang and we let it go
I rather do it than say it, that's facts, you know?
I can't relax no more
These bitches so practical
Ain't in my lane, what the fuck is you driving for?
Pedal to the floor, they hatin' because they bored
Gettin' so much money, I'm turning into a hoarder
Backpack full of gas, I'm feelin' like that bitch Dora
And I got niggas on my page just beggin' to give me oral
Don't get in my way, I gotsta get paid (I gotsta get paid)
Fashionista shades like gyms, we move weights
Party like parades and wake up in a daze
No wonder why they wanna switch bodies and trade places
Don't get in my way, I gotsta get paid (I gotsta get paid)
Fashionista shades like gyms, we move weights
Party like parades and wake up in a daze
No wonder why they wanna switch bodies and trade places
