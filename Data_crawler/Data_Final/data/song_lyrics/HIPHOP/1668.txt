Song Name: California Breeze
We all want someone
Made it out the trenches, this type of life I can get used to
Number one on YouTube, private dinner in Malibu
Show you how to work your stick
Ain't nobody gone handle you
Put you in a Phantom cause you my lil boo
Ready for whatever, I tie up my boots
Everybody goin' the same route so I switched up my route
Niggas ain't what they be talking bout so I switched up my crew
Actin' like you love me knowin' it's flaw so I'm gone fake it too
What else am I supposed to do?
Aware of my surroundings, Ion fuck wit y'all, don't come around me
Baby switched up how that sound? Like a nigga in his feelings
You can't name something I did flaw, I'm a dying breed of the realest
Ain't never worry 'bout another nigga so in that case I'm the biggest
I been travelin' around the world, my pivots still ain't left the business
She got everything I want, ain't no need to fuck wit these bitches
You can go and have a lil fun, Ian gone trip baby, I get it
I ain't bullshitin in this game, wherever this plane land I'm the littest nigga there
Turn ya back on me, I ain't even care
If you need me, I'm still gone be there
Tell me how the fuck is this shit fair
Switch on who? I wouldn't dare
Fuck them too, I'm prepared
I run shit, get that clear
Heart broke, can't drop no tears
Was what it was, is what it is
California breeze, take her out to eat
Stop at a lil party
End up at the big house
I can't fuck wit shawty, cause she got a big mouth
Pull up in a 'rari, hop out like a big dog
Get my shit together, feel like I done took two years off
Bookin' up my schedule, I ain't rich enough to chill out
I watched you turn sour, I still don't know how to feel 'bout it
Majority of 'em folded but I'm still solid
I'm still out here, still don't know how to feel about it
Early in the morning talkin' to Marquis about it
Wonderin' should I let it go, or, we beefin' bout it
Knowin' that I'll go cold on you for weeks about it
And it wasn't even that deep but that's just how we be with me
I can't lie, she be fuckin' me good but girl you fuck me better
I'm not surprised that you stereotype me to be a lil guy
But if I can have a second of yo time, try to elevate yo mind
We can crush 'em on every level, I'm tellin' you
I fell in love with generating revenue
I know they gone try to push you from the top, so, I'm careful
I put niggas under my wing like they my nephew
I'ma give you every piece of game I got when I catch you
I'm just tryna let you feel the breeze (with me)
California breeze, take her out to eat
Stop at a lil party
End up at the big house
I can't fuck with shawty cause she got a big mouth
Pull up in a 'rari, hop out like a big dog
Get my shit together, feel like I done took two years off
Bookin' up my schedule, I ain't rich enough to chill out
I watched you turn sour, I still don't know how to feel 'bout it
Majority of 'em folded but I'm still solid
No, no, no, no
I'm supposed to be gone
But, shit, where I'm gone go?
Tryna hold it in, I can't let this shit show
It can't be forced, it don't work, let it go
I try to tell you, you act like you know
