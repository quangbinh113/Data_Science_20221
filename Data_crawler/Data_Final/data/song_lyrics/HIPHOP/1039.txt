(Outtatown but we never outta money) aye, you know what I'm saying, Big 14 shit
(Star Boy, you're my hero)
I just got a million bands today
'Bout to go and spend a bag, blow them bands today, yeah
'Bout to spend a hundred grand today
Lot of blue face hunnids, it's a blue band parade, yeah
Huh, grrah, shootin' out the Hummer today
I'm in a bad mood, so I feel like dumpin' today, yeah
I'm a bad move, I'ma dump at his face
Keep the toolie by my side, feel like Ratchet & Clank, yeah
Shoot out the Wraith, stick up
I need everything in your safe, nigga, huh
I'm with them gravediggers, we gon' dig your grave, nigga, huh
Pop molly at the rave, nigga
Chains on me, no slave, nigga, huh
We been in the cave, nigga
We done fucking made niggas, uh
Take your chain, nigga
What the fuck you claim, nigga?
1400, 800, bitch, I'm talking gang, nigga
We not the same, nigga, Big 14 Great Dane, nigga
Fuck what you claim, nigga
Feel like the KKK, we kill you, then we hang niggas
Do that the same day
Pull up in the all grey, black Mustang
In the streets, I was hustlin'
Run up on me, gun bustin'
Uh, that's your best friend, that's my main thing
Uh, she give me titty, Tity Boi, 2 Chainz, uh
Uh, get to the nitty-gritty, boy, new stains, uh
Uh, pouring Prince up in my cup, no Purple Rain
I'm throwin' bands, I'm throwin' hands, and I ain't throwin' shade
Jumping out the bat cave, just like Bruce Wayne
Kickin' shit like Liu Kang
My plug Palup√©
Big racks on us do things
Big blues, no clues, yay
Your bitch like to choose, ayy
But that's your boo, ain't it?
Take a flick, uh, licky on my dick, uh
On my blick, uh, while I take a shit, uh
And a piss, uh, sing to that bitch like Kiss, uh
Oh, that's your bitch, huh
R. Kelly, I may just piss on her (skrrt)
I'm in a 'Rari
You make me mad-mad, I may shoot up your party
That lil' bitch she bad, but she fake, she a Barbie
But she still know to ride me like a fucking Harley
Ask me if I love her, I responded to her "Hardly"
Jumping off the top rope on that bitch like Matt Hardy
Why the fuck your pussy ass in here? This a gangsta party
"What? What? What?" like I'm Playboi Carti
Got my robe on in this bitch, it's a Playboy party
That bitch hella plastic, that bitch just like a Barbie
Playin' games with all these hoes, bitch, just like Atari
Kicked up with my feet up, sippin' Hennesy in a Safari
With a bunch of white bitches and they all like, "Trippie Redd, you gnarly"
Viral, iCarly
She on the webcam, like Carly
That's your girl, I'm sorry
She was off the molly
Uh, I'm in the trap, I'm whippin', I got your aunty on my dope
She told me she ain't have enough money for them rocks, my dick up in her throat
I'm going hard, LOL to the bank, no joke
You run up on me, you leaping froggy, you get croaked
Uh, huh, you know
