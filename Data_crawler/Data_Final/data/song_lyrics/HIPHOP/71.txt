Song Name: 66
DY Krazy
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
Flexin' for these bands finna pop out, ayy
Boolin' on the block I got my Glock out, ayy
I just pulled up in a Bentley
All the hatred go right to your fucking kidney
Flexin' bands, lil' nigga won't get a penny
I'ma keep on running it up, ayy
I'ma keep on running it up, fucking it up
This choppa busting you up, ayy
There you go, testing your luck
Dumb as fuck, yeah (ayy, ooh)
Flexin' baby, pull up in a drop top
Diamonds dancing on me, they be hopscotch
Bling Blaow, shinin' fresh just like some pop rocks
Fireworks we gon' pull up to yo' block, pop
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
When my brother get out, told him ain't no block now
Same bitches creeping all up on my cock now
Twenty bitches and they all coming with me
Side by side, me and Trippie in the Bentley (skrrt, skrrt)
And I bought it ain't no renting
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck, why is you venting?
In 2016 I got hotter than your skate team
In 2018 I need at least like eight rings
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
