Song Name: Stand On It
Here we go again (Ok)
Big body Benz (Skkkrt)
Cut off all my friends (Yea)
Choppas for my enemies
Go and ask the streets about Lil Dominique
I been a beast
Really got my name from shootin' dice
And selling niggas weed
557, 223s
308s go through a car door
All the houses paid off
None of my hoes aint got no car note
Sell a thousand, scream free Ralo
Baby, you should stop it, I know
Everythings a profit, fasho
Pilot waiting on us, let's go
Still be in the projects with Coldhearted and Q Ball
Wreck the Rari, buy a new one tomorrow
I'm too raw
I got foreigns all colors like a pack of Starburst
When they ask me how it happened
I just tell 'em God works
I'm tryna touch me a billi
Still hustle like I'm on zero
Really done saved some niggas
That's why they call me the hero
Trappin' like this shit legal
I'm tryna uplift my people
I used to serve in a Regal
I turned them into believers, yea
Ion want yo bitch
We can't swap out (Swap out)
They ain't on shit
Tell 'em pop out (Pop out)
Mama I got rich
Look at yo drop out (Drop out)
Guns up
It aint nothing to talk bout (Guns up)
Outside in yo city lookin good (Lookin good)
It's a draco call it "Wish A Nigga Would" (It got wood on it)
She think that she special
But I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to
Everything I say I stood on it
Outside in yo city lookin good (Lookin good)
It's a draco call it "Wish A Nigga Would" (It got wood on it)
She think that she special
But I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to Everything I say I stood on it
My life really a miracle
My bitches said I'm magical
I still fuck wit Lil Critical
I ran through more than half of them
I put on for that Avenue
I had to bust my ass for this
How a bitch who never even met me
Gone try to tell my business?
How someone I only had sex once wit
Gone try to have a kid by me?
Once you cross that line
You dead really
That's how it is with me
Brodie got rich off of Percs
He sell 'em 25 a piece
My lil scammin' ass bitch
Made quarter million in a week
I ain't never thirsty
Run into a hoe and don't even speak
Got that blick on me in public
Hope they think it's only me
This shit different
They gotta go through my assistant just to reach me
If nobody else gone show 'em
I'll teach em (I'll teach em)
Outside in yo city lookin good (Lookin good)
It's a draco call it "Wish A Nigga Would" (It got wood on it)
She think that she special
But I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to
Everything I say I stood on it
Outside in yo city lookin good (Lookin good)
It's a draco call it "Wish A Nigga Would" (It got wood on it)
She think that she special
But I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to
Everything I say I stood on it
