Song Name: Ok Ok
Okay, now they got me, wanna rap again
Heal the wound and then you stab me in my back again (uh)
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (uh)
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my n- in
See me in person, I look like a ghost (brrrr)
See me in person, I look like a ghost (bow!)
You wanna come and then play with the G.O.A.T (bow!)
You wanna come and then play with the G.O.A.T
All you rap n- sound like me, can't tell who is who
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you
Price went up (yeah), angel investor (yeah)
Price went up (uh), angel investor (yeah)
Okay, okay, I'm not okay
Think they're good? It's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay (uh)
Think you're good, get out the way (uh)
Who said I did what? What did they do?
Why the hell you hatin' so damn hard? Someone must pay you
They don't keep me 'round 'cause I'm straight truth
My dawg locked up had more home runs than Babe Ruth
Had them chickens cleanin' my house, I told them, "Be of use" (brrr)
If I see disloyalty, then we gon' cut 'em loose (yeah)
Have my hands 'round her neck, grip tight like a noose (hee)
Tell you a story with a bad ending 'cause I'm not a Seuss (yah)
Passin' around d- to the thugs for an immunity boost (go)
Double cup filled to the top with the serenity juice (yes, sir)
Moment of silence, R.I.P to Juice (hey)
If they say it's up, it's up, I don't need the truce (now)
Everything I do is solely for the broken youth (sheesh, yes)
I just took her over the mountain with my index (wow)
She told me to go to hell like I ain't been yet
And I still put in overtime like I ain't win yet
Okay, okay, I'm not okay
Think you're good? It's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay
Think you're good, get out the way
It's been plenty times you closed the door on me
That s- really show me how much you say you a bro to me
Showed you love and you constantly cold-shouldered me
But ain't no goin' back to fixin' up, that's the older me, yeah
I'm done with all the fake s-, I had enough of that, yeah
I done had too many n- stab me in the back (yeah, yeah)
They say they with you, but they really puttin' on a act
That's when s- hit the fan and, all of sudden, all the facts show
You gotta chin up and show a n- tough love
Let 'em go without you just to show 'em what it was
We was so close, you would've thought we was blood
We got the same pain, we come from the mud
I swear this shit make me wanna put my all in it, yeah
You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah
Most of these n- ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no
Most of these n- ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no
But it's okay, we gon' be okay
Only show up when we cut the cake (oh, yeah)
Showin' love, but we okay (we okay)
Find God 'fore it's too late
