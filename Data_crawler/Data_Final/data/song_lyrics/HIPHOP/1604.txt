Song Name: Street Runner
Pipe that shit up, TnT
These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The goodbyes, the hellos, the "I need you, no I don't"
Every time I start to close the door, you knock and I let you in
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I care (yeah, yeah)
I don't know why I love you
Look, uh
Sorry I missed your call, I was on a jet
I been so zoned out, tryna figure out what's next
So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone (yeah), wishing I can hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (yeah)
I hope chasin' my dream don't get in the way
I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay you down but I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain
She tell me fuck you, I hate you, then I love you, can't blame you
She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you
I just hope we don't end how they do
Crash and burn on The Shade Room
Street runner, gotta stop running sometimes (yeah)
I'm in your city tonight (yeah)
And these lights (these lights), make me feel so inspired (yeah)
Going higher and higher and higher (yeah, yeah)
Taking me higher (taking me higher)
Higher and higher and higher (yeah, yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch

I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind
And I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I should just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired (I can't hang up)
Going higher and higher and higher
