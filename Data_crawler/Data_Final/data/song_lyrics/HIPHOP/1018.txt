Puerto Rican and she straight up outta North Atlanta (Atlanta)
Say she love me 'cause she know she fuck with G Shine
Grew up thuggin' with them killers on the boulevard (the boulevard)
But she pull up on Lil Melly in the mean time
That's my wife (my wife), that's my bestie, bestfriend (my bestfriend)
I will never, lie or pretend ('tend)
That's my wife (my wife), that's my bestfriend (my bestfriend)
I'll never ever lie or pretend
Be honest, would you ride for me baby girl? (Uh-Uh)
'Cause I ain't tryna lie to you baby girl (uh-uh)
Push your feelings to the side and you never use your heart
And I'm talking no pride for you baby girl (uh, uh, uh)
I know a couple niggas try to do you wrong (uh-uh)
Couple fuck niggas hurt your heart (oh, oh)
You say you're tired of these lame niggas (lame, lame, lame)
I respect you 'cause you move smart
You're too sharp
Girl, I bet you back in New York
You already doing your thing (your thing)
Everything drip, shawty too thick
You could top a nine, I say that with no shame (no shame)
You could top a nine, I say that with no shame
I'll never let a nigga try play with your name (your name)
Baby, you my bitch now everything changed (changed)
She been on that shit so I made her my main (oh, no)
Shawty roll with whatever any real nigga tellin'
She ain't worried 'bout shit, she just tryna get back (get back)
Now she ain't a rich bitch, said she want cash (get cash)
Try to introduce you, she say she ain't high (ain't high)
She came on my body so I told her, "My bad" (my bad)
I'm a rich nigga, I could treat you like I'm your dad (your dad)
Fuck about a hater, we leave 'em more mad (more mad)
Girl you ain't know, I got something for yo' ass (no, no, no, no)
Fell in love with my bestfriend (bestfriend)
You're my, you're my bestfriend
Fell in love with my bestfriend (you my, you my)
You're my, you're my bestfriend
Puerto Rican and she straight up outta North Atlanta (Atlanta)
Say she love me 'cause she know she fuck with G Shine
Grew up thuggin' with them killers on the boulevard (the boulevard)
But she pull up on Lil Melly in the mean time
That's my wife (my wife), that's my bestie, bestfriend (my bestfriend)
I will never, lie or pretend ('tend)
That's my wife (my wife), that's my bestfriend (my bestfriend)
I'll never ever lie or pretend
And you know a nigga slime, slime
And you know a nigga slime, slime (slime, slime)
