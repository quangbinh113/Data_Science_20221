Song Name: Heyy
Yeah
My favorite bitch just cut me off, and she won't even let me know the reason (yeah)
It's probably one of her lil' messy hatin' ass friends bein' evil
I ain't stressin' 'bout it, she'll come around when she wanna eat it up
Slow stroke, fast stroke, grindin' it, I'm a real pleaser
60 hoes in New York havin' dinner
Bottega send it to me soon as they get it
I put Maybach seats in the Sprinter
Make sure everybody sit comfortable
You gotta really pay attention, I'm not mumblin'
Sh–µ tryna have a good time, she wanna come with us
They know we can't be fucked with, they not one of us
It's done been sometimes I slipped, I'm not fallin'
Brabus baby blue, the inside too, I'm feelin' like a kid again
They thought I got lucky last time, fuck it, I'm back on that shit again
Her last bag was a crocodile Kelly
Got it chocolate to match her skin
I just gave bro a hundred pounds of wham
Told him, "Tell the city it's in"
Majority of the time, I "Hi" and "Bye," these niggas
I ain't with all that lockin' in shit
Money over everything, try to stop it
You get popped right then and there
Message thread full of, "Where you ats?" and "Pull up on me"
Bunch of whens and wheres
Youngins out here wildin' with no guidance
All they care about is who they kill
I was tryna keep that shit in order
It got harder 'cause I'm never there
It's a better life out here
I promise, brodie, I'ma keep it in they ear
I know how it feel to spin a opp
But it feel way better to count a million
I come from the bottom of the bottom
I shot right up through the fuckin' ceilin'
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Soon as it pop, bro pull that fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
This her first time comin' to my house (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Better go hard, girl, this your try-outs (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Soon as it pop, bro, pull that fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
This her first time comin' to my house (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Better go hard, girl, this your try-outs (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Yeah, stay down, hustle hard until you come up
Take some, only when you need it
You won't make it far bein' greedy
My grandma taught me how to be a leader
If we fly commercial, we got greeters
They just know that we important people
They see how we comin', think we ghetto
Until they children tell 'em I'm their hero
Flight attendant said I look familiar
Crack a smile, tell her, "It's a small world"
Oh, that's your bitch? That's my ho too
We gon' share her, call her, "Our girl"
Real street music, I ran that field
If you can hit that, then she ain't my girl
Get your lick back, come step in my world
Two bitches on the same itinerary
The same flight, same hotel, they don't even know each other yet (yeah)
One of 'em don't say nothin', the other askin', "Do we go together yet?"
Young turnt nigga, ain't no holdin' back
This a Brabus, bro, not a regular Wagon
I don't kiss and tell, I ain't into that
I don't think I met a nigga colder yet, like
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Soon as it pop, bro pull that fire out (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
This her first time comin' to my house (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
Better go hard, girl, this your try-outs (hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (hey-hey-hey)
