Song Name: I Bought Her (feat. Lil Duke)
Yeah
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed
R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash
I had to tint the Jag'
She said she don't suck dick
I called that bitch a cab
New York can't go for no bad apple
I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast'
I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops
That big, big Birkin bag (that Birk')
I whipped up in Beverly Hills,
But it wasn't sushi (that big, big Birkin bag, that Birk')
I couldn't afford her
She was way better at Hooters, ooh (took out a order, whoa)
I gave a forty clip brand new AK to a shooter (shootin' in 4K)
I can get a nigga ass smoked for a bowl
Of noodles, whoa (I can get your ass smoked)
I gave a forty clip, take to the woadie, the shooter, whoa
I bought a Carbon 15 and it's tall as a ruler
I had the doctor come see, I thought it was voodoo, whoa
I left that car parked outside of the boogaloos, whoa (skrrt)
You don't go need for speed, yeah
I just been movin' 'em (I keep the dope, boom, boom)
I been in Trusletree
And I just been boolin it, yeah (I been to Trustle)
I need to catch me some Zs
'Cause I just been booted up (I need to get me some sleep)
I had your bitch on her knees and I told
Her toot it up (got your bitch on her knees)
Fish fork aye, I whip my wrist, I deep fry dope, on baby
Acrobatic door Mulsanne I bought my baby
Florida water, pussy pink, I make her basin
Flawless diamonds, some are pink like a Mercedes
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed
R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash
I had to tint the Jag'
She said she don't suck dick
I called that bitch a cab
New York can't go for no bad apple
I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast'
I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops
That big, big Birkin bag
What you finna get? Hundred on my wrist
Hundred on the necklace, hundred on the clip
Hundred on his head, I just splat a flip
Hundred on my bitch, couple of crips
I can never rat, I can stack the chips
I will never fuck her, I just got the lip
I just gotta love it, I just gotta kill it
I just gave her chrome, I just got a VIP
Hoppin' out a jet, I can get her wet
Louboutin chest, under my neck
I came with the drugs, Hi-Tech
The VVs on my neck, as big as it gets
I came from nothin', too fuckin' reckless
I'm a slime ball, baby, I'm treacherous
Iced out Hermes belt like a wrestler
Fuck her good, but I never kept her (yeah)
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag
I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed
R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash
I had to tint the Jag'
She said she don't suck dick
I called that bitch a cab
New York can't go for bad apple
I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast'
I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops
That big, big Burkin bag (that Birk')
Fish fork, aye, I whip my wrist, I deep fry dope, on baby
Acrobatic door Mulsanne I bought my baby
Florida water, pussy pink, I make her basin
Flawless diamonds, some are pink like a Mercedes
