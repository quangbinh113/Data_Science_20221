Song Name: Megan's Piano
Okay, I gotta remember how to like, make it sound fire
Don't even think, just don't even think of what you doing to it
And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it
Big ass chain 'round my neck so these niggas know I'm rich
And I'on need shit but the dick
Big ass stack in this purse, so these niggas know I'm working
I'm holding this Glock in my Birkin
Niggas gotta hold that L tryna come for my pen
I'm really finna make another M
Now tell me how the fuck I'm in the wrong
If I don't want the nigga, and he still ain't fucking with the bitch
I be working, I make moves in silence
Hoes might've never liked me, and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinking that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all trying it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit (ah)
Sorry, hoes hate me 'cause I'm the "it" girl
I ain't never asked to be the shit, girl
Don't call me "sis'", 'cause I'm not your sister
You really need to come and get your mister
Seeing all my opp's linked up in a picture
Everybody look busted, injured
Stalking my page, bitch probably wanna scissor
All in her mouth like I kissed her
I be working, I make moves in silence
Hoes might've never liked me, and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinking that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all trying it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit
Bad bitches run in my pack, gang shit
Cartier frames, spot a bitch on some lame shit
Broke niggas all in my way, clear 'em
Chains ain't making no noise? They ain't big enough
Wyling on a boat, on an island
When I throw it back, bet I make him throw the towel in
I got a nigga, but I don't need one
He fuck up, I'ma have my fun
Teacup, I can fit a bitch in my purse
Which one of y'all wanna go first?
Spicy, ain't a bitch out built like me
I run shit, probably how I got a deal with Nike
Beefing? You just mad we ain't speaking
And I'm the one that put the roof where you sleeping
Phoney, I don't need no new homies
I'm the reason all my opps ain't homeless, ah
