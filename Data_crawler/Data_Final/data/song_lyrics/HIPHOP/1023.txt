Song Name: Mind of Melvin (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)
Yeah, ooh (yeah)
Mhm, save me, mind of Melvin (yeah)
(It's a young nigga world)
He said he'd take control of me (me)
The devil got a hold of me (it's a young nigga world)
The demons are inside of me (me)
I'd kill if you don't ride for me (Mega, you played that boy, ha)
I'd kill if you don't ride for me (yeah, me, yeah, yeah)
They told me, do ungodly things (yeah, yeah)
I killed your seed, I'm sorry (yeah, yeah)
I killed your son, I'm sorry (fuck them niggas, yeah, ayy, yeah)
Melvin, oh (ayy, fuck them niggas, ayy)
Mind of Melvin, oh (welcome to the mind of a maniac)
Mind of Melvin, oh (welcome to the mind of a maniac)
Mind of Melvin, oh (welcome to the mind of a maniac)
Bitch, I am Melvin, and I am a killer (a killer)
Don't play with the crew, if you do, I'ma kill ya (I'll kill ya)
I load up the carbon, and bust at them niggas (them niggas)
Who the fuck is that?
That boy look familiar (who the fuck that is? Ayy)
I keep a .50, I keep a .20
I keep a .17 shot Glock
I got a .30, no, it's not stock
I got a beam right there on my Glock
I saw an opp at the top of the block
When it come to my gang, tie my dreads up like hot
Turn 'em a stain, he more than a napkin
Shoot that lil' pussy, these niggas be actin' (bitch)
Load up the carbon, I load up the ratchet
These niggas talkin', but these niggas actin' (brrrr)
These niggas talkin', but these niggas actin' (I know)
She told me that we would be forever (forever, yeah)
Thought that we would always be together (oh)
But I know that it is the nighttime (the nighttime)
The demons only come out at the nighttime (nighttime)
Alright
God, you ain't givin' me the right signs (the right signs)
If you come right now, it'd be the right time (like right now)
To sleep, I don't even fuckin' recognize (alright)
Who I am, what I look like on the other side of the mirror
I'm like, "Who are you? Are you steppin', steppin'?" (Who are you?)
He said, "Hell yeah, I'm Melvin, Melvin" (mind of Melvin)
I ran into this dude in my dreams (alright, alright, alright)
And he said everything is not what it seems (not what it seems, yeah)
He told me that his name was Melvin, Melvin (name was Melvin, yeah)
I told him that my name was Melly, Melly (I'm Melly, alright)
He looked at me and told me bro, ooh-ooh (ooh)
"I really like your album, I Am You"
He said that he would take control of me (me)
The devil got a hold of me (I can feel it)
The demons are inside of me (of me)
And I'd kill if you don't ride for me
Go to the club and I'm known make it rain
Jump in the Bentley like it is a Range
I swear the devil be playin' with my brain
I ain't buy no house, bitch, I brought me a chain
VVs plus ones, they hit like cocaine
Fuck nigga, I don't even know your name
Lil Uzi Vert, yeah, I'm all about gain
Even if I gotta bring the pain (yeah)
He told me that his name was Melvin, Melvin
I told him that my name was Melly, Melly
He looked at me and told me bro, ooh-ooh (ooh)
"I really like your album, I Am You-ou"
And I said, "Who are you? Are you steppin', you steppin'?"
I cannot see him, but I felt it, I felt it
I stay with the green on me just like relish, like relish (slatt)
Only thing don't like 'bout Melvin, he selfish, he selfish (fish)
Every time that I am with her, he jealous, he jealous (get jealous)
Gotta keep my mouth closed, I can't tell them, won't tell shit, yeah
He said he would take control of me (me)
The devil got a hold of me
The demons are inside of me (me)
I'd kill if you don't ride for me
Fuck them niggas, yeah
