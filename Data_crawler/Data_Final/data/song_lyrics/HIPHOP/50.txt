Song Name: Peak
Treat you like princess
Rest in Heaven, Diana
Piquin' my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me
"Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for 4 weeks"
"I told her go on a date"
"All of a sudden she married"
"Didn't say get bloodclaat married"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
What I'm sayin', in today, really at our big, big age
If you're gettin' with someone right now
And you're linking them for couple weeks
They should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see'
So lemme lock off the ting
But obviously in the world that we live in today, it's not like that
He is, did that, but obviously it takes time
You're chattin' shit
First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning
It should be like honeymoon
That's what I said, that's what I said!
The beginning is always honeymoon season
Yeah, well you do overdo it and he's overdoin' it
Both of you are overdoin' it right now
Yeah, well, alright
