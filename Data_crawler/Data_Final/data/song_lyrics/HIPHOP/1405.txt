Song Name: Wasting Angels (with The Kid LAROI)
This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like the summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
Oh
Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head
Devil on my back so I sleep on my chest
Waitin' at the gate how'd they get my address?
On my last nerve while I'm rippin' cigarettes
It's a killer I know, it's a killer I know
I just need a lil' somethin' get me through the day
Yeah my mind is blank or I overthink
It's gettin' old but it's nothin' new
I say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
Need to say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like the summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
I blacked out left a hundred missed calls on your phone
I mixed my drink with a couple of drugs
Spit in my face now you hate that I'm gone babe
You're doin' the most
I don't need somebody to be the one to keep me honest
I don't wanna know the truth, I can't fight if I'm alone
I need enemies
You know how far that I will go
Every road takes its toll
Before you leave, I'm gone, I'm gone
This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane, before the fame
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like the summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now
