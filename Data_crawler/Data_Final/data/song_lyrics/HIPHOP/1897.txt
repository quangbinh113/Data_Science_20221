Song Name: Da Rockwilder
Oh my God, oh my God
Aaaaauw (Boom), Uh, yeah
Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn them kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For cheesy, too many wanna be hard be easy
It's all n'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes I'm never satisfy like the Stones
We don't condone bitin' see them selling crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap reciting
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the group home
Tical, fuck your lifestyle
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin' got you feelin' with your pipes out
Time for some action, surfin' the avenue
Mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols
My niggas got issues, again, same song
Armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone
Yo, I was going too but we roam, cellular phones
Doc-Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spit bank loans and homegrown
Suckers break like turbo in no ozone
When I, grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark
Leave you in a Blue Lagoon lost, true
V9's and a glove with Nasu he dyin' in the car
While we behind on the bars
Haters don't touch
Weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt up, all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump, sippin' on a forty
Yo smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun and Red and Meth gettin' jumped
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Yeah come on, Red and Meth gettin' jumped
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
