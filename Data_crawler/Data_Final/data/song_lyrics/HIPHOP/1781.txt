Song Name: Pacman
That's Jojo
Scratch mixed it
I'm-I'm not like that (I'm not)
But they wanna stop and search for a pack on man (Ayy, ayy)
Can't lie, man darted (Ayy, cut) 'cause rahted, they wanna cuff my hand
I am like that, so I get nervous when I sight me a Transit van
Feds on me from when I can stand 'cause
I'm from a place where you pack man (Look)
PC wants to give me time ('llow it)
Mandem, he's buggin', ahlie? (Ahlie?)
Fizzler, I'm one of a kind (LOL)
Take two shorties, not one at a time (Let's go)
You can say I'm good friends with crime (Whoosh)
And my right-hand man is buyin' (Bang)
Also, I'm at war with swine, wow, what a life
This is packs, there's undies, where? (Who's that?)
Like right over there, just look over there, don't stare (Ayy)
I got bare bredrins that are fake, they just talk behind my back
Think I'm fine with that (Why?), but I'll burn that bridge today
Get caught like Askar, they're like, Askar, pray
Thank you for eejit, yay (Yay)
I'm not like that (I'm not)
But they wanna stop and search for a pack on man
Can't lie, man darted (Ayy, cut) 'cause rahted, they wanna cuff my hand
I am like that, so I get nervous when I sight me a transit van
Feds on me from when I can stand 'cause
I'm from a place where you pack man (I swear that's feds?)
I'm not like that (I'm not)
But they wanna stop and search for a pack on man
Can't lie, man darted (Ayy, cut) 'cause rahted, they wanna cuff my hand
I am like that, so I get nervous when I sight me a transit van
Feds on me from when I can stand 'cause
I'm from a place where you pack man
From-from-from now, right now, yes, right now
Say what I want, don't care what you say (Hear man out)
Got bare on my mind
Raisin' my hand in the class like, "Pick me, Miss, I'm eager"
Told off kids, told off like teacher
Thinkin' like, "Err, what do I say next?" (Ayy, ayy)
Scratchin' my head, uh-error (Error)
That's clever, found what I say next (Yes)
I'm in the streets, so I'm knees deep (Like)
But I never let me be six feet (No)
I do man, I won't lose sleep
It's not in my gum when I lose teeth (Bap, bap, bap)
We're locked in for life for weed and a Lucy
A 'runcheon in the coochie (Gang shit)
Tell the feds
"Stop tryna do me, I only want an interview from Snoochie"
(Ayy, 'llow it)
I'm-I'm not like that (I'm not)
But they wanna stop and search for a pack on man (Ayy, ayy)
Can't lie, man darted (Ayy, cut) 'cause rahted, they wanna cuff my hand
I am like that, so I get nervous when I sight me a transit van
Feds on me from when I can stand 'cause
I'm from a place where you pack man (I swear that's feds?)
I'm not like that (I'm not)
But they wanna stop and search for a pack on man (Ayy, ayy)
Can't lie, man darted (Ayy, cut) 'cause rahted, they wanna cuff my hand
I am like that, so I get nervous when I sight me a transit van
Feds on me from when I can stand 'cause
I'm from a place where you pack man
