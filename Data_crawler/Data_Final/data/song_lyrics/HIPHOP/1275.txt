Song Name: Love$ick (feat. A$AP Rocky)
Please man, pretty please with a cherry on top, can you please?
The weather cold
The weather so
Chill, Chilly Willy penguin feather roll
'Cause I'm sipping Pro'
Yeah that 'meth is pro'
Promethazine, yeah, a stepping stone
Oh, they acting up? Get your weapon drawn
They only killing time, another second gone
I heard your man ain't home
Now you melatone
But you acting young
And you hella grown
I need you
I'ma wait for my lil' momma come home
I want you
Man, I swear to God, she gon' miss me when I'm gone
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck (Come over here), and it's right but you wrong
I need you
I want you, come over here
I need you
I want you
I need you
I want you, come over here
I need you
I want you
Okay she giving me love
But it fuck my energy up
Every time it finna be summer, only got the memories of us
And now we industry lovers
They making enemies of us
I mean, sometimes we in public, they drain the synergy from us
Visit Italia, be my se√±orita
I-vee-tha or Eye-be-tha either way you need a visa
I ain't talking bout MasterCards, debit cards either
Credit charge, Kermit the Frog, margaritas
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishin' I ain't had no pants on me
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I want you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I want you, come over here
I need you
I want you
I need you
I want you, come over here
I need you
I want you
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I'm a lovesick fuck

I'm a lovesick fuck
