Song Name: Better Days (NEIKED x Mae Muller x Polo G)
I've been feeling lonely, I need someone to hold me
Come on, baby, hold me
Yeah, I've been feeling jaded, don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it
Now you, you've been moving on
Let me know, can I come along?
Since you're gone, oh, it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own
Living in a haze, staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an amen?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Uh, uh
Can I get an amen? Introverted, can't make friends
Pray for better days, now it's 300K when my day ends
Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Said be careful with her heart, 'cause it's fragile
And thinking 'bout her past make her lash out
See with me, it ain't no worries at all
Any problem? I'll be there in one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, I'll hang pictures on my wall
Roll one, let's get high tonight
Backseat Maybach, lavish life
Chilling with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm, and it's shining bright
Living in a haze, staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an amen?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait
For better, better, better days, oh
I could use a break, oh
Better, better, better, better
For better days, no, oh, oh, no, no, no
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Better days
All I do is sit around and wait for better days, no, ooh
