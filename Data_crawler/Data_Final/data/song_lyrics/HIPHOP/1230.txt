Song Name: Opp Stoppa (feat. 21 Savage)
(21, pussy, pussy) shh, shh, sheesh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, all these pancake ass niggas, weird ass niggas man
What are all these niggas talkin' 'bout? (Pussy, pussy)
Ice cream ass niggas (ay, ay)
I keep a rocket in my pocket, socket called a pocket rocket
If it's war, we ain't playin' games bitch we get it started
I'm the man, clip it, keep a hundred nigga I'm a gunner
When it's beef, we ain't playin' games, we hit you and yo' mama
Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your partners
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa, baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
All these tattoos on my fuckin' body, she say I'm a hottie
Why your girlfriend always wanna fuck me, wanna touch my body?
We got all type of fuckin' guns, might even have a Tommy
I remember them days in the jail, still free my nigga Rodney
And free Chris though, 'member we was bouncin' out with .44's
A nigga keep it silent, in L.A. I keep a clip though
'Cause no, I can't be lackin' in these streets, I keep a big pole
And I can't have no nigga with me if they gon' snitch on us
Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your partners
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa, baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
Ayy, big dawg Savage (21)
Toss your baby mama in the air like she a salad (on God)
Ratchet bitch while I'm drivin', she from Dallas (straight up)
Lil' mama got some buns on her, I call her Patty (21)
My model bitch be smokin' all the woods, she from Cali' (21)
In my Tesla Roadster (21)
My pistol out the holster (On God)
I'm double cuppin' syrup, bitch, I don't need no coaster (facts)
Opps want promotion (pussy)
We put 'em on a poster (pussy)
I gunned him down in his own hood 'cause he local (pussy)
My watch ten bricks (god shit)
Rolling Loud Miami, I pulled up with ten sticks (21)
Bitch, smell my fragrance, you can't tell me I ain't rich (21)
Big 4L, I ain't shakin' no hand with no snitch (21)
Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your partners
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa, baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your partners
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa, baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
