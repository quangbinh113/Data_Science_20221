Song Name: Still Not a Player (feat. Joe) - Radio Version
Whoa ooh, yeah
Don't wanna be a playa
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin for
For my thugs, for my thugs
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot
Hey yo I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, French count seats, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's
Now we reach the peak age, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my, I'm big huh, I rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get hoof
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
Uptown baby, uptown
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot
I love from Puerto Rican to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of that ass
Long as you show class, and pass my test
Fat fuckin' breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown hoe wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
(You nasty Twin)
I don't care, round here they call me Big Pun
If you with the big guns thick tongue, known to make a chick come
Hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I edited even Luke be like 'Don't stop, get it get it
Hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I edited even Luke be like 'Don't stop, get it get it
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin for
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
No more rollin' with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad
Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher
Punisher, Joe and Big Punisher
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
