Ayy, I'm tripping on you, I gotta have you
I spend it on you, I might buy two
Now get in my coupe
I like her legs up like chopsticks
Luxury in my optics
Your ex-man's on the opp list
I'm validated to pop shit
I'm a high profile, hunnid mile flex
Flying down the aisle, blowin' loud, flex
I got a bad habit with bad habits
Beat the pussy up, stab at it
Divin' in like I'm mad at it
Secured the bag, I need all static, ayy
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Yeah)
I love them chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Alright)
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, yeah
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, chop
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Yeah)
Her legs chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Alright)
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, yeah
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, chop (It's lit)
I got 25 rolled up on my dresser (Dresser)
25 bad ones in the function, can I stretch 'em? (Stretch 'em)
Who wanna get chose for the foreplay?
Hop out a Black Rose on your b-day
Make everybody fall for you, jealous
Bat wing on the ground to the PJ
I say, "Bad bitch, bad bitch, five star, bad bitch"
Got you on, whatever you want, gotta have it
Fuck so good, that's talent
I pray for you, now that's balance
I run it up before the trial end
They talking about us, we wildin', we wildin', ayy
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Yeah)
I love them chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Alright)
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, yeah
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, chop
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Yeah)
Her legs chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks (Alright)
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, yeah
(Ooh) Chop, chop, chop, chop (It's lit)
