Diamante, baby hairs laid (yeah)
Money long, long, bitch, I been gettin' paid (uh)
Keep a big bag, never fold, Damier
Bitch, I'm good in any hood but it's love in the Bay (mwah)
And my wrists on my baguette, we ain't shinin' the same
I pull up in a Range and the squad never change
Icy, that's the gang, gang, gang
'Bout get it on the floor, buss it down, make it shake (yeah)
Long ass nails like some crab legs
Team on supreme, never average
How yo' bitch be disappearin' from the side, bitch? (Bitch)
Damn you fine, you a dime, you a savage (that's right)
I know that's right
Ain't never motherfuckin' wrong, ey

Give a lil' somethin' if he start gettin' greedy
Got a squad full of tens and they all hella pretty
Where the big ballin' niggas and they friends at? (Mwah)
Where the ends I'm finna spend a couple M's then?
Where the Yves Saint Laurent full of lens at?
Make a chick have to fix up her wig cap, wow
Patty cake, patty cake, get your man
Everybody on me when I do my dance
I look like money and I taste like M's (mwah)
I see them imitate but it's cool, I'm a trend
Move my ass like that and my makeup planned
I don't chase no man, that don't make no sense
She a bougie ghetto girl, so they mad bitch, and?
If you got a problem with it, you can come and get the hands
Get it, get it, get it, girl, get it, girl (get it, girl)
Get it, get it, get it, girl, get it, girl (get it, girl)
Get it, get it, get it, girl, get it, girl (get it, girl)
