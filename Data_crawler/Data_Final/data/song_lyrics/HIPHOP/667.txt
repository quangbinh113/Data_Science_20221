Song Name: Welcome To The Party (feat. Skepta) - Remix
This is a Melo beat
Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Baby, welcome to the party (Sex)
I got the ecs, the shrooms, the acid, yes, you can see I'm a savage
(Don't try this at home, I'm a savage)
Baby, welcome to the party (Sex)
She pulled up in a Benz, she came with her friend
I told her meet my nigga Bari (Gang)
I'm a villain, I'm feelin' like Carti
Yeah, you see the 'fit, I'ma Die Lit
I beat it, I buss and I dip
I told a witch stop following me
She stalkin' me, she tryna ruin my trip
These niggas run around, screamin' "Gang, gang"
I ain't never seen you on the strip
Never ever had the pebs in your mouth
Never ever had a tool in the whip
Had heavy metal like a bench press
It's a waste of time sendin' death threats
I got love letters I ain't read yet (Sex)
The club close, we ain't left yet
Fuck a dress code, we're the best dressed (Ice)
Double R's in my head rest
Asked her if she's coming and she said yes (Mmm)
That's shopping sprees and the best sex
You're just a silly nigga with your silly raps
Snitchin' on yourself in your verses
I was drivin' home, saw the light was on
Pull up on your girl for a service (Sex)
And when it's showtime, they be takin' money out their purses (Shing)
It's a hundred racks when I touch a stage, how could I ever get nervous?
Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit (Get me lit)
Gun on my hip (Gun on my hip)
One in the head (One in the head)
Ten in the clip (Ten in the clip)
Baby, baby, don't trip
Just lower your tone (Lower your tone)
'Cause you could get hit
Don't let that Henny in my system (Nah)
I catch a body, next day I forget it (Next day I forget it)
Nigga, Dread just caught a body (Nigga, Dread just caught a body)
And that's on the gang, nigga, I was just with him, look
Free all my rilla niggas, all my villain niggas
All my killer niggas out the cage
Since a youngin, nigga, I been drillin' niggas
Ma, I'm sorry I'm stuck up in my ways
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit
With this big chip, I had to get paid
And it's 10K to go on stage
And you know the treesh gettin' laid
Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit (Get me lit)
Gun on my hip (Gun on my hip)
One in the head (One in the head)
Ten in the clip (Ten in the clip)
Baby, baby, don't trip
Just lower your tone (Lower your tone)
'Cause you could get hit
