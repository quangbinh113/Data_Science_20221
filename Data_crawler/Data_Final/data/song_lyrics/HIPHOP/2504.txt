Song Name: LABELS CALLIN'
Who dat boy? Poppin, show stopping
Bitch, go to hell (That's how you feelin?), that's how I'm rocking
They ain't wanna show no love to the boy (On God)
Ain't wanna hug the boy (On gang)
But now I'm up, they turn around, like, "Who the fuck the boy?"
Bitch, don't text me, talking out yo' neck, boy, please don't let me
Get near yo' bitch, boy, she gon' sex me
Call Becky up, we gon' go and buy a boat
(Ah it's smokin', it's smokin', go 'head)
Bitch, I like jet skis, I like gettin' money
Makin' shorties come and neck me
I like drinkin' forties wit my muhfuckin' besties
Talkin' about, "He know me," boy, he know he never met me
More money, more problems, but that money got me right
Happened overnight, boy got a name, they ain't wanna fight
My style so nice, who couldn't like me?
The ones who ain't on my team
These rappers copy writin', they music don't excite me
Boy, I hear the same shit, different nigga, same style
And don't compare me to these rappers when they money counterfeit
Real recognize real and I don't see a lot of it
I got ninety-nine problems and ain't one of them a bitch
That should let you niggas know that I ain't worried about shit, nigga
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember (keep it going)
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember (yeah)
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember
I remember life was simple with the little nine to five
Tryna stride just so I could book the studio time
Cinco told me everybody gonna know bout' Mike Dimes
Now I hear my music playin' while I'm workin' part-time
Who that be? Double Lamb OG, hottest in the street, yeah that's me
I'm the man that yo' father tryna be, who that be?
I'm the nigga that yo' daughter tryna see, who that be?
I'm the rapper that yo' brother want a feat' from
I earn my three stripes like a nigga joined Adidas
My number M-I-A, can only reach me through a beeper
I know they talkin' 'bout me 'cause they know I'm not gon' speak
Real ballers know to never throw the ball into the bleachers
I'm hot lil' nigga, everybody tryna hit my line (Where he at?)
Tryna talk, can't waste my time (Can't, can't)
Make niggas rap my lines (On God)
These hoes just want my shine (It's true)
They don't even know about me but they say they love Mike Dimes
But I do the same shit just to get between them thighs
Bitch, I'm poppin'
Get my cover in my story like a logo - Johnny Stockton
The trendin' topic, it's so ironic
These hoes was just tryna call my ass toxic
But everything changed when them labels started plotting
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember (yeah)
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember (yeah)
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember
I remember niggas, I remember niggas I remember
