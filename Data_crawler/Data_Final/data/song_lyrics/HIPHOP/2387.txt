Song Name: starstruck
When I brought her to LA
She was starstruck
How they livin' off of
Adderall and Starbucks
Started asking
"Baby, when can it be my turn?"
To go off lightin' up the sky
Before I'm stardust
And I don't need a fight
In the mornin'
My baby crazy
Got me yellin' while I'm yawnin'
She go from naked
Then to makin' me exhausted
It's exhaustin'
So we look both ways
And walk down Sunset
'Cause she saw fame
And now she's obsessed
With all these fakes
I swear this life is
Gon' break her down
Her friends said she's changed
She's always upset
Versace shades and
A Gucci sundress
To hide the pain
'Cause this ain't quite what
She had planned out
(Nope)
Yeah
Man, I spent a couple years
On the west coast
In time I find it's getting hard
For me to let go
She want whatever she can take
To get her mind right
And she ain't never gonna make it
But she'll get close
My heart been hurtin'
Ever since she said
"You're homesick"
My head been hurtin'
Since six this mornin'
Proceed with caution
Every step is at your own risk
And this is somethin'
You ain't seen before
I can't bounce back
When she gets that
Way with herself
'Cause she's my angel
But she puts herself
Through hell
So we look both ways
And walk down Sunset
'Cause she saw fame
And now she's obsessed
With all these fakes
I swear this life is
Gon' break her down
Friends said she's changed
She's always upset
Versace shades and
A Gucci sundress
To hide the pain
'Cause this ain't quite what
She had planned out
(Nope)
