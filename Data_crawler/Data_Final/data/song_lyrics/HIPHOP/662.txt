Song Name: Magic (feat. NLE Choppa)
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me
When I'm up, don't fuck up my mood
Diamonds dance, they came with tap shoes
Grab a cup, baby, I got the juice
You ain't heard, baby? Sprado the news
Remember them days I had nothin' to lose
For that, I got somethin' to prove
Double back when they see me improve
But I never cared 'bout approval
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no talkin', but we 'bout that action
Talkin' shit but we talkin' faction
If I said it, we makin' it happen
You don't know it, now you better tap in
The miggity MAC, her legs crossed in the back of the 'Bach
We switched positions, now her ass on the dash
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Love me
I need love when I'm high
Baby, I'ma druggie
Ayy, are you for me?
I'm mad with I'm with you, I'm coolin' without you, so I'm ignoring
Catch you with that nigga
I'll post at your house and knock the door in
Geekin' back, reminiscing 'bout the shit that we had did
Was it wrong or right? I don't know
I say God forbid me on this road that I'm drivin' on
Drivin' on a ten speed
Chopper big as Kevin hart
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me
Diamond on my wrist, ayy
Driver her insane
Best she ever had
Yeah, that'll never change
She just wanna fly in the coupe with the wings
Got more sauce than a Harold's wing
Told her if she love me, don't change on me
Told her if she love me, make her way with me (Way with me)
