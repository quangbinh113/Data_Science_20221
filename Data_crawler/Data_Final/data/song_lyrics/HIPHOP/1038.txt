Song Name: Demon Time (feat. Ski Mask The Slump God)
Ha (haha), demon time, nigga
Yeah, gang, uh (gang, gang)
Hell, give 'em hell (brr, bah)
I got bells (bah, bah, bah), I got shells (bah)
Shells (I'm shy, oh my God)
Shoot a nigga up 'cause I ain't worried 'bout shit
Diamonds on my neck and on my wrist
I got lots of Perkys on me, shit (shit)
Doin' ten with a ten, tryna win
Tryna grin at the devil (at the devil)
Bitch, I am a rebel, I don't give a fuck
Talkin' all that shit, lil' bitch
Then I pull up and shoot you up (brrah)
Ayy, yeah, yeah, know my mind hella corrupt
I get to that money, lil' nigga, on my brother (on my brother)
You could never, huh, you could never motha'
Fuck you and yours, you ain't really 'bout it
Said he want some smoke with gang, but man, I really doubt it (doubt)
Put some racks up on your head, lil' bitch', a hundred thousand (haha)
Bitch, I'm fly (mwah), Ferragamo Falcon
King of the jungle, y'all niggas buck, man, we really bouncin'

I ain't never worry, but I know they worry about me
Bitch, keep starin' (haha, keep starin'), keep starin' (ayy)
Keep starin', ayy, keep starin'

I get money, big bands
We ain't playin', big grams in the blunt

Yeah, like Zelda, bitch, I'm tryna link (tryna link)
Faucet failure, I been breaking sinks
Legendary like I am a sphinx (sphinx)
At the ball with your bitch, a few drinks, and a mink
Pink Panther skin-colored I think (I think, uh-huh)
They don't understand the words that I link (I link)
They be sleep like a Bill Cosby drink, yuh, huh (yuh)
They know we lit, goddamnit (yuh)
I'm up on Planet Namek (yuh)
On demon time (yuh)
They panic 'cause they thought a nigga was satanic (yuh, yuh, ayy)
'Cause we keep that tool like mechanic (hahaha)
On Planet Drool with Lava Girl, you know we doin' damage (okay)
Sausta, matter fact, Black Clover, bitch, I'm muthafuckin' Asta
Money longer than a dread head on a Rasta
Let's get this shit straight, I'm 'bout to fix your damn posture
'Til I'm at Heaven's gate, bitch
I'ma stay smokin' (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Yuh, yuh, opps, what did you say? (Woo)
Just like an animal, just like a cannibal
Your bitch out here suckin' meat every day (okay)
I'm on a pedestal, never go federal
Eating that cake like I'm damn anime (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Smokin' that zaza out here in LA
We the one blowing up like some grenades (let's go)
Bitch, keep starin' (haha), keep starin' (okay)
Keep starin', ayy (keep starin'), keep starin'
I don't even like to kickstand
I get money, big bands (yuh)
We ain't playin', big grams in the blunt (yuh, yuh)
What you sayin'? (What you sayin'?)
Man, what you sayin'?
