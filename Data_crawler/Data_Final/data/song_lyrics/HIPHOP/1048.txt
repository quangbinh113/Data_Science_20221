Song Name: Know You (feat. S-X & A1 x J1)
Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
I just wanna know your name
I got some things I'll show you
Yeah, baby, slow down
Nah, I don't want no drama, ooh, na-na
You know that my heart's in the dollars
I'm just tryna get to know you
Get to know you
Doing you slow, slower than dial-up
Grabbin' the stick, now you're the pilot
Put in a reef, now money pile up
So many milli's, I gotta feelin' now I'm whippin' her
Pure cream and now I'm lickin' her
Funny and booty, you know I'm pickin' her
Your beauty unruly, that's why I came around the jiggy-jiggy
Big Poppa just like I'm Biggie, Biggie
Bigger than your ex, facts
I know you wanna get back
Dolce Gabbana, spray Dior, then bring the nana, yeah
You know what I came for, trust
Slow down (slow down)
I just wanna get to know you (know you)
I just wanna know your name (your name)
I got some things I'll show you (oh, yeah)
Yeah, baby, slow down (slow down)
Nah, I don't want no drama, ooh, na-na (na-na)
You know that my heart's in the dollars (yeah)
I'm just tryna get to know you (ooh)
Get to know you
I got money that your man don't have
I got girls that your man can't bag, haha
I got girls that your man can't whack
Sh–µ's only bae for the day, then I sent her back (haha)
Break up then make up, guess we're better as friends
They all say they got me, but they switchin' in the end
Why you gotta pretend? Man, I came from the ends
Now we up, now they cool, that's the latest trend
Baby girl, you know that you're a blessing (blessing)
I get a smile on my face when you be textin' (textin')
Baby, do you love me? You ain't gotta ask the questions
She let me hit 'cause she heard I'm the next ting
Slow down (slow down)
I just wanna get to know you (know you)
I just wanna know your name (your name)
I got some things I'll show you (oh, yeah)
Yeah, baby, slow down (slow down)
Nah, I don't want no drama, ooh, na-na (na-na)
You know that my heart's in the dollars (yeah)
I'm just tryna get to know you (ooh)
I just wanna know your name
