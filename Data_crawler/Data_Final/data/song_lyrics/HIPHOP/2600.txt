Song Name: Jupiter & Mars
You don't love me, girl
You could have it all
Jupiter and Mars and all these stars (yeah, yeah)
Just let me know, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Deep down, we know, deep down, you and I, we know
That this not meant to last, think back to all the times we rode
Around the city where they call me town hero
Know the whip is automatic, and it's black as Don Cheadle
Yeah, and we could start from ground zero
I don't know if it's me talking or the Crown and Casamigos
All I know, we never talk on how we feel 'cause of our egos
But if you down to grab the clip, then I'll reload, yeah
I got this liquor in my cup
I might be tripping, but this feel kind of abrupt (abrupt)
Now I only see you in the club with all these niggas I don't know
And all these people I don't trust (trust), yeah
Why we competing over crumbs? (Crumbs)
Agree to disagree, it's not that deep to make a fuss (fuss)
We both know you need me 'bout as greedy as it comes
If you leave, I hope to lead you back to me, you know what's up
Be my baby doll
It's hard to see the sun
When you don't love me, girl
When you could have it all
On Jupiter and Mars and all these stars
Just let me know, yeah
I might as well let you know 'cause it's off we go (we go)
Our separate ways, end this thing on a high C-note
I'm tryna pay you homage, you childish as Gambino
I showed you all my cards like we gambled at casino
Can't handle the fact you not what I thought (yeah), you a placebo (yeah)
Damn, but nothing impossible
I keep it going, take it a day at a time (time)
Knowing we'll be right where we started, I'm seeing the signs (see like)
Like how you give me just enough that still leaves me deprived
Your other nigga did you wrong, see the fear in your eyes
She know she scared to be alone, so she keep it disguised
Drag me 'long for the ride and I fall every time
It's a cycle that keep me hyping her, done with the laundry, though
It's best I check on myself sometime
See what the wealth imply, want more than the rest combined, yeah
And I know shorty electrifying
But I got a place to be, and I got a check to find
Well, I know you want me, it's settling in
But you don't love me, we compatible better as friends
What's understood, don't ever gotta be said of again
But she still calling me for company Saturday's end, damn
You don't love me, girl
You could have it all
Jupiter and Mars and all these stars
You don't love me, girl
You could have it all
Jupiter and Mars and all these stars (yeah)
Just let me know, yeah
