Song Name: Sextasy
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You won't need me luckily
Oh girl
(Mike WiLL Made, WiLL Made)
You're not taking tonight luckily
Let me save you like a refugee
Let me give you sextasy
Don't let me be a memory
I've got the drink and a remedy
I know you be so intimate with me
Intimate with me couldn't wait
I know you're ready for my embrace
I think you're ready for love's embrace
And you can't please everyone
You're coming out in the dark
But what is it you wish to find?
Just let me ease your mind
Criticize them, just ease your mind
Is it mine? We'll find out in due time
I've been searching near and far
I don't care where my old one ends up
I know you're ready for what's to come
I get enough for both of us
Oh and I hope you stay relevant
Blessed like a person so heaven-less
Oh, gave you nights that I can't take back
Oh, and I won't regret and I won't forget
And I won't for- and I can't forget
I was creeping with the restless
You can't pay for the vibe you get
Say that you won't work against me
Time to leave you with the rest of them
Lipstick matching, magenta
I had a simple agenda
And we connect immediately
And I need more time to give you everything
I need your love for me to be
To rescue me from myself when I feel my heart
Take my soul then lose my number
In a dream, we'll never be apart
I was dark when I lost my star
But if you cry with somebody, be concerned
Come with me, I can't do you no harm
Fuck with me, be with me in the home
Have you smile, bless you all the way home
