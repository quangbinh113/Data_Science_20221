Walk up to 'em and walk 'em down
Early form up, AS arrival
Hit 'em in their damn mouth
Standin' on the block with the gang in this bitch
Got my fag on the lift and I'm letting it rain
Draco bounce it to the right and to the left

Ooh, big smoke, ayy
Big dope smoke and I got it in the back
Brother told me, go get me a rack (go get it)
So I went and got a pack and I made it right back
Had to make this shit double 'cause I got it like that, what

My niggas just wanna get millions, ayy
They see a young nigga gon' make it (no cap)
So they feelin' like they can go get it, ayy

And my uncle doing life, he ain't never comin' home (no cap)

And these niggas don't know 'cause my mind really gone
