Song Name: Chapter 1
You light the sky on fire when it's rainin' on us
Had to be a new man, so I changed, new career path
You done everything right but I'm still gettin' left
She said, "Without you love, there's nothin' left"
So, can I be by your side now?
And I promise I'll make it all alright now
Can I be by your side, girl?
Make it all alright, girl
We can jump on this ship together, out of this world
So, can I be by your side, girl?
You should know better, promise him man, he's blind, girl
Can I be by your side, girl?
Make it all alright, girl
Or I'll put you on this ship, I fly you out of my world
