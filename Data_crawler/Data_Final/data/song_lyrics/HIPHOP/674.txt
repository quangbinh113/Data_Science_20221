Song Name: Cafeteria (feat. Gunna)
A'ight, let me get, uh, the spicy yellow tail, need that, need that
What'd you say Don? You need the, the Wagyu tacos?
Let him get that
Uh, lobster tempura, always need that
You know what? Fuck it
Just bring a whole bunch of shit out and
I'll tell y'all if I like it or not, come on
Yo, Chase B
I like my women (I like, ah) in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with a new boo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil' shawty sloppy, she asked for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, Young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made a blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga
What would you do? (You do, you do, get it)
Officer, I'm sorry, baby, I was throwin' those hundreds (I'm sorry)
Smoke blown in your face, I know you want all my money (I'm sorry)
Better read me my rights, you know Don ain't no dummy (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh)
I get checks and I'm hard to impress, I dislike police, please
I'll be honest
All of my block (block) Don back in the streets (please)
The way my shit be rumblin', hungry
You need one of these (yeah, yeah)
Took me long enough (oh), lil' baby, to find how I keep (yeah)
I like my women (I like, ah) in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with a new boo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil' shawty sloppy, she asked for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, Young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made a blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga
What would you do? (You do, you do, get it)
Went and bought a new ring, set it on some new shoes (new shoes)
I kicked her out like Liu Kang
I couldn't play the fool (couldn't play the fool)
Young Wunna spittin' propane (ah)
No way I can lose (way I could lose)
Hope I don't go insane (ah), we floatin' on 'shrooms (god)
Feel like somebody spinned the room (spinned the room)
How much I make? My ex assume (ex assume)
Someone slipped me a X or two (X or two)
Pill go straight to my head (woah)
Oh, don't know what I headed to (headed to)
Took the foreign and spin (let's go)
Oh, my nigga, my hands are pulled (hands are pulled)
Like her pussy, I'm wet (yeah)
She wan' come to the spot at A-L-C (yeah)
I know rappers, they mention they is next (on God)
You a bird that ain't made it out the nest (yeah)
Hustle more, it'll bring you lots of stress (they did)
You're my ho, I'ma treat you to the best (yeah, yeah)
Marble floor, my house'll cost a jet (jet)
Feel like Floyd, hit backends on the jet (what you doin'?)
Goin' hard like I play for the Knicks
I like my women (I like, ah) in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with the new doo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil' shawty sloppy, she asked for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, Young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made a blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga, what would you do? (Get it)
(You do, you do, you do, you do)
(You do, you do, you do, you do)
(You do, you do, you do, you do)
What would you do? (What would you do, you do, you do, you do?)
What would you do? (What would you do, you do, you do, you do?)
M.W.A Music
What would you do? (What would you do, you do, you do, you do?)
