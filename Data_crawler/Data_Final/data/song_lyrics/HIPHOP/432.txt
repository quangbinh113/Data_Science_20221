Song Name: 6 Kiss
I love Trippie Redd
Pourin' up fours, mud in my cup
Won't look at the past, it's behind us
Fallin' in a bottomless pit, find us
Life is a purge, sound of the sirens
Do whatever I want, don't give a fuck, live my life, uh-huh, uh-huh
I got your wife, she my slut, she take nut, uh-huh, uh-huh
And I don't walk shit at all, I'm on the money run
I don't got no opps, they stay inside 'cause they scared of my guns
Your bitch said she want a real one, I told her, "Come and find one"
It's funny how you pussy, but you never been inside one
Ayy, these dumb-ass virgin-ass niggas mad
They run when they see the gun in my hand
Bullets like Twitter, they follow them
Nut, my kids, she swallow them, ooh, yeah, she swallow them
Boy, you're chain ain't solid gold
Your jeweller finessed, he hollowed them
These niggas say they wit' it, uh, we gon' Harry Potter him
Make that lil' bitch disappear, got VVS's in my ear
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a chandelier, we shinin' on your bitch
We flick these hoes wanna fuck
'Cause I'm so freaky-deaky and your bit gon' eat me
You know that we killing these fuck niggas
Hell naw, ain't no throwin' a wife like, "Hell nah"
Pussy boy we don't bite that pussy
Nigga, pull up on him and bite that, uh
Hundred and thirty K on a Cuban link, ayy
Shawty wanna fuck, suck the dick and be my bae, ayy
Chillin' on that couch, fuck your bitch in her mouth
Catch a nigga slippin', put it in his fucking house (Slatt)
I ain't with the talkin', I ain't with the talkin'
I ain't with the talkin', put the pussy nigga in a coffin
He red, nigga say he bleedin', he red, he red
I'm killin' everybody instead
It be so cold up in the summertime (freezin')
In the summertime (freezin')
Diamonds on my fingers, baby blue, they look like Megamind
I don't know reality, bitch I feel like Coraline
And we from the Northside, pull up, Optimus Prime
I don't wanna miss life
Promise it feel better takin' his life (takin' his life, yeah)
Yeah, codeine when I piss right (when I piss right)
'Cause we live that fucking triple six life
Yeah, that 6 kiss life (yeah, six, six)
Murder, what it is, murder, what it is, yeah, murder, what it is, uh
I'ma catch a murder in this bitch, that's for certain in this bitch
Like close the burtains in this bitch, uh (yeah, uh, yeah)
Uh, it's a living Hell (right) and we live in Hell
From there, live in Hell, from there, I live in Hell, from there, yeah
La-la-la-la, gang, la-la-la-la
