Song Name: Good Times
I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high, I get high, I get high on your memory
High on your memory, high on your memory
I get high, high, high (everyday) high
I get high, high, high, high
(Every night)
I get high, high, high, high
(All the time)
High
Every day I need an ounce and a half
S.P., the only flower that you know with a bounce-and-a-half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin' up, 'cause if I'm sober, dawg
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite, I'm in the zone all alone
Muthafucka 'case I'm dyin' tonight
So I roll 'em up back-to-back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come and to slide to the hood
I get high, high, high, high (Everyday)
I get high, high, high, high (Every night)
I get high on your memory, high on your memory (All the time)
High on your memory (Everyday)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (All the time)
I get high, high, high, high, high
Ayo, I smoke like a chimney, matter fact I smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy, I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the hippies did back in the '70s
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin' the floor
I get high 'cause fuck it, what's better to do
And I'ma never give a fuck, 'cause I'm better than you
I get high, high, high, high (Every day)
I get high, high, high, high (Every night)
I get high on your memory, high on your memory (All the time)
Get high on your memory (Every day)
I get high, high, high, high (Every night)
I get high, high, high, high (All the time)
I get high, high, high, high, high
I'ma smoke 'til my lungs collapse, I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful
I smoke weed 'cause time seem precious and I know what a hour do
High for a livin', gots to ride for a livin'
Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin'
Shit, I get as high as I could
'Cause if you see things like I see things
'Cause I'ma die in the hood
Muthafucka understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch, I get high
I get high, high, high, high (Every day)
I get high, high, high, high (Every night)
I get high on your memory, high on your memory (All the time)
High on your memory (Every day)
I get high, high, high, high (I am the ghost)
I get high, high, high, high (Flow with me)
I get high on your memory,
High on your memory, high on your memory high, high, high
I get high on your memory,
High on your memory, high on your memory, high, high, high
I get high, high, high, high, high
