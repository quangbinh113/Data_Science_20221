Song Name: Ice Cream Paint Job
Haha
Yo
Mr. DO double R
I say...
Yeah buddy, rollin like a big shot
Chevy tuned up like a nascar pit stop
Fresh paint job, fresh inside
Is the outside frame and the trunk wide
Are the rims big, do it ride good
Lean back right hand on the pinewood
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job
Clean on the outside, cream on the inside, ice cream paint job
Got screens on the dash, watchin saved by the bell,
Got a house by the bayside
Yeah I'm livin like that
And I'm ridin like that
Boy I'm ridin like that
And the steerin wheel wood like a baseball bat
Just like archie said we ready
Whole click straight lunatics like nelly
Grand marquis paint job grape jelly
Or a triple BC big black box chevy
Crank my car, she be hummin
Rims so big you could see me comin
Primetime click, we get money
Stay iced up like t.v. johnny
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job
I'm live, like a superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lotta niggas pissed off
Yuh, paint shine like lip gloss
Cadillac gotta wide body like rick ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it I'm a buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like kimbo slice
Been ridin tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims alright
Dat right thurr see see I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark [Like what]
Woof woof, like 2 dogs
Primetime click make ya move like U-haul
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice cream paint job
Ice cream paint job

Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin high so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk, 4 screens in the deck
I ride with a towel cause the candypaint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin high so I ride upset
