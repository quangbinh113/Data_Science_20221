Song Name: 9 Ways
I was sendin' out 'nuff blank texts
I really didn't know about morning textin'
Re wants a favour, wanna see a text sayin' "Bae" with capital X's
Minus one and Jimmy still sweatin
I was sendin' out 'nuff blank texts
I really didn't know about morning textin'
Alice is askin' "How's my business?"
Like me and Dookie are bredrins
Re wants a favour,wanna see a text sayin' "Bae" with capital X's
I trap the fuck out of winter
Minus one and Jimmy still sweatin'
I was stickin' up so much man
Even though I had bricks droppin' like Tetris
From young i had no direction
Runnin' from CIDs in the old-school Vectras
More time,i'm gang on my ones
But you don't wanna buck gang as a collective
Just know we ain't pickin' and choosin'
One man's cool,fuck being selective
It's peak if selected
I've seen man sacrifice bredrins
Lil' bro love rinse coin from machine,but his machine ain't vending
Push big weight,man bench it,same time dodgin' a sentence
Can't lie,back in the day,it was tough
Pockets were brack,no choice,but to mend it
Now,we cop our own sticks,run our own phones
Now,we're well respected
I heard network is net worth
I'm all about long time,Jimmy stay connected (From kway back)
Drop weight on the younger and tell them"Stretch it"
I wish I had someone like me back then
I done wrong,but with good intentions
I do road in the night and day
Baby girl always tell me drive safe
Two phones twerk,they don't vibrate
I'm a night boy,tryna make bread 9 ways
I don't take no breaks,still grindin' like 258
'Nuff consequence if man violate
That's juice and tape on a man's estate
I do road in the night and day
Baby girl always tell me drive safe
Two phones twerk,they don't vibrate
I'm a night boy,tryna make bread 9 ways
I don't take no breaks,still grindin' like 258
'Nuff consequence if man violate
That's juice and tape on a man's estate
Been in the hood for so long juggin'
The whole ends know I'm established
From kway,this phone's been stamped in the ends
Same time,i was there for the madness
Bro just 'llowed me a stain,so I'ma clean it and then vanish
When it's live,all in my face
Tell a man best skiv if I start move erratic
If I want it,i cop it or if i want it i tek it
Stay mannered and stay man's bredrin
I burned bare bridges but i ain't burned friendships
Mummy said find yourself then I found myself
When i made my first ten trips
K love robbin' the most,i think he's got a robbery fetish
I fell in love with the T
Where would i be if i weren't out sellin'
Could quit the trap right now then relapse
Who would've thought that the jugg so temptin'
The life i live is expensive
Music don't cover my expenses
And neither does female pressures so i rise up and go get it
Bro got the patience,may roll ju
He done left guys for the medics
When his car door pops
'Nuff man sprint and turn athletic
Hope the gangdem blow
Shell down shows,put a rest to the kweffings
Free all the guys,release dates pending
Still gettin' days extended
I do road in the night and day
Baby girl always tell me drive safe
Two phones twerk,they don't vibrate
I'm a night boy,tryna make bread 9 ways
I don't take no breaks,still grindin' like 258
'Nuff consequence if man violate
That's juice and tape on a man's estate
I do road in the night and day
Baby girl always tell me drive safe
Two phones twerk,they don't vibrate
I'm a night boy,tryna make bread 9 ways
I don't take no breaks,still grindin' like 258
'Nuff consequence if man violate
That's juice and tape on a man's estate
I was sendin' out 'nuff blank texts
I really didn't know about morning textin'
Re wants a favour,wanna see a text sayin' "Bae" with capital X's
Minus one and Jimmy still sweatin'
