Song Name: Taken Care
Uh, yeah
Uh
You know you-
Know you-, know you-
Um
So fuckin' selfish
You want me to yourself and not be no one elses
Knowin' that you leave my heart helpless
You shot me down so much that you can't help it
Arguments and conversations poppin' off
Take you out to Saks where we can shop it off
Penthouse flowin' brick, oh you gon' tap me off
You so fuckin' selfish you won't stop at all, yeah
Cash out that bag, I got your feeling's out
To the mornin', we can make love 'til you feel me now
Got you spinnin' into my feeling's and you still en route
This ain't the time for this, oh no
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
You know I'm takin' care of me right now
Oh, no, ooh, no
Yeah, yeah
Uh, so fuckin' toxic
You rather hold onto me even when I'm nauseous
Arguments, you got it, you got it
You may have got it, but you not slick, oh no
Arguments and conversations poppin' off
Take you out to Saks where we can shop it off
Penthouse flowin' brick, oh you gon' tap me off
You so fuckin' selfish you won't stop at all,
Cash out that bag, I got your feeling's out
We'll be sextin' 'til the mornin', you can feel me now
Spinning in my feelings and they still en route
Know this ain't the time for this, oh no
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (know I'm takin' care of me)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (oh)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (know I'm takin' care of me)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (oh)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (know I'm takin' care of me)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (oh)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (know I'm takin' care of me)
You know I'm takin' care of me right now (oh)
Oh, no, ooh, no
Yeah, yeah
