Song Name: Bad Boy for Life
Ayo, you ready?
Let's do it
I'm the definition of, half man, half drugs
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wassup?
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothin' but big things, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what change but the name?
We still here, you rockin' wit the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think 'cause I'm iced out, I'ma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right dawg, we ain't ever left
We just, moved in silence and rep to the death
It's official, I survived what I been through
Y'all got drama, the saga continues
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
Ay, yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem with me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We tryin' to be rich before we do stop breathin'
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames
You got the wire, if not I ain't sayin' no more names
You'll soon expire, no pain, nothing
I feel remorse, yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (We miss you B.I.G.)
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps that flow
Still them cats that know, pack ya flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop
Joints that rock, play the background
Hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit' jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad Boy 'til the casket drop
Gotta love it, place nuttin' above it
It's on like that, don't believe, we ain't goin' like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
