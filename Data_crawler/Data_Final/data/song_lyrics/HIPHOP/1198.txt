Song Name: Enchanted Waterfall
I left my love at your place today (uh)
We're too young for these incidents
Wore my heart on my sleeve too long
Going through heartbreak won't be too long
She's got my name tatted on her wrist
I don't know why something's wrong with this
This burning love, I ain't seen before
And I don't know if I can handle it anymore (oh, no)
Just would you let me know (oh)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Just would you let me know (oh)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh (stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh ('cause I'm still stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (let me know)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh
I'm watching from a distance
I don't want her to pass me by
Look up, it's a full moon outside
There's things we both can't deny
Leaving my love at your place today
So wrapped up tryna break away
Kisses and hugs, they just fade away
It's the time we do our own thing
Leaving my love at your place today
Finding the feelings you chased away
Realizing this could've been the last
Well, if you are bound to stay, yeah
Just would you let me know (let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Just would to let me know (let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh (stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh ('cause I'm still stuck on you)
