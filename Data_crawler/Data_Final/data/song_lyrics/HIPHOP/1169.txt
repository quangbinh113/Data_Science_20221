Song Name: Piano G
He had it hard, now he just tellin' his story
Speak from the heart and I just tell 'em, "Record me"
Five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
Livin' lawless, we don't respect no authority
My paper straight, can't put these hoes for my priorities
I'm trapped inside 'cause I don't know who really for me
No, I ain't trippin', I just play this shit accordingly
Trapped in the field, he got blood on his cleats (uh, uh, uh)
Stickin' to my .40 like a Velcro strap
Don't go tweakin' with my shorties, or them shells gon' clap
Swing that red beam, leave your head in your lap
My nigga institutionalized in them cell doors, trapped
Free all 'em real niggas locked away
Still slavery, it's just modern day
Married the game, now we partin' ways
Do it for gang, that's the hardest phase
They let it bang, yeah, them Glocks'll spray, ooh
Had it hard, so my heart kinda heavy, and I'm scarred
'Cause deep feelings like machete
Finally, made it, pourin' champagne on my presi'
I can only give you my all if you let me, uh, uh, uh
He had it hard, now he just tellin' his story
Speak from the heart and I just tell 'em, "Record me"
Five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
Livin' lawless, we don't respect no authority
My paper straight, can't put these hoes for my priorities
I'm trapped inside 'cause I don't know who really for me
No, I ain't trippin', I just play this shit accordingly
Trapped in the field, he got blood on his cleats
And I wonder, would the love be the same
If I couldn't make no more hits?
I hit the stu' all the time with a dream in my eyes
Tryna ball like a number one pick
They don't really know 'bout the nights I cried
Just to put this Cartier on my wrist
I'll give up every last chain just to give my grandma one more kiss
One minute you here, then you gone
Lotta shit just happen so quick
But as life goes on, more niggas just fade away out them pics
Lookin' back on them times, I ain't have no luck on my side
I used to wonder how bad it can get
Tryna find my place in this world
Used to wonder, was I ever gon' fit?
Every day high as hell, just takin' up space on the block
I ain't even have no blick
Same niggas yellin', "Bro" and shit, it was jokes and shit
Used to laugh when I'm like shit
Like damn, I'll risk it all for the gang
Still be the one niggas won't miss
I was in denial runnin' from reality
A lotta shit I ain't wanna admit, no
He had it hard, now he just tellin' his story
Speak from the heart and I just tell 'em, "Record me"
Five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
Livin' lawless, we don't respect no authority
My paper straight, can't put these hoes for my priorities
I'm trapped inside 'cause I don't know who really for me
No, I ain't trippin', I just play this shit accordingly
Trapped in the field, he got blood on his cleats
