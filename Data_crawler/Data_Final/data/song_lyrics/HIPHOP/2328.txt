Song Name: What Kinda
(Have you ever been to London?)
Ayy, yeah (squat made the beat)
Don't you, don't you hate a-? Oh
Ayy, oh, save a hoe
Yeah, ayy
Don't you hate an ol' tricking ass?
Talking 'bout he in the kitchen ass
Get a bag, nigga, why you out here with your leeching ass?
Reaching ass nigga, in my DMs tryna, eat my ass
Freaky ass nigga, ol' peewee ass nigga
Ayy, what type of nigga wear his homeboy shirt?
In his baby mama crib, riding his baby mama whip
Man, what type of nigga tell lies on his dick?
Always running to the 'Gram every time he hit a lick
Yeah
95 percent of this niggas fake rich
The other five percent of this niggas, all bitch
Like Too Short said, bitches ain't shit
Ooh, 50 niggas in the section, pushing hoes down (yeah)
Sharin' bottles, smokin' hookah, they the hoes now (yeah)
Know your pussy, I can smell it, pull your clothes down
Store-runner, fake stepper, he a whole clown (yeah)
What type of nigga spends the night with his boys?
You a grown ass man, you a dyke to your boys
Same type of nigga booking flights with his boys
In the club taking pictures, making bad bitch noise
Don't you hate a ol' tricking ass?
Talking 'bout he in the kitchen ass
Get a bag, nigga, why you out here with yo' leeching ass?
Reaching ass nigga, in my DMs tryna eat my ass
Freaky ass nigga, ol' peewee ass nigga
Ayy, what type of nigga wear his homeboy shirt?
In his baby mama crib, riding his baby mama whip
Man, what type of nigga tell lies on his dick?
Always running to the 'gram every he hit a lick
How you online claimin' bodies all your niggas gettin' touched?
Whole gang outside, still got your chain took
Steady snitching on the 'gram, made the fed's pick you up
At the gas station tryna holla, please, leave me alone
How you dead broke, not a dollar, but got three phones?
Tryna figure out why you flexing? Riding in that loan
Your hairline ain't even long, nigga, keep your hat on (yeah)
What type of nigga beg a rapper for a pic'?
In a section full of bitches, but ain't tryna fuck shit
You too excited for these niggas, even got the same fit
Buying watches for your boys, but you say you ain't a trick
Don't you hate a ol' tricking ass?
Talking 'bout he in the kitchen ass
Get a bag, nigga, why you out here with yo' leeching ass?
Reaching ass nigga, in my DMs tryna eat my ass
Freaky ass nigga, ol' peewee ass nigga
Ayy, what type of nigga wear his homeboy shirt?
In his baby mama crib, riding his baby mama whip
Man, what type of nigga tell lies on his dick?
Always running to the 'gram every time he hit a lick
What type of nigga wear his homeboy shirt?
In his, baby mama crib, riding his baby mama whip
What, what, what type of nigga tell lies on his dick?
Always running to the 'gram every time he hit a lick
