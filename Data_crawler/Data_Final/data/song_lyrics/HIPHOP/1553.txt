Song Name: CODE (feat. Moneybagg Yo)
Y'all niggas need to stop playing with me
All y'all niggas acting like y'all niggas got a issue or something
(Money done geeked on this motherfucker)
Like it's a joke, or it's a motherfuckin' game or some, you know?
I don't play no motherfucking games, man
Yeah, woo
Staring at my wrist, it froze (wrist)
Yeah, it blew a kiss on her (mwah)
Water diamond, crystal (water)
Keep your kids from Mystikal (hey)
Smoke, what's your temperature? (Smoke)
Bet' not at or mention 'em
Get you whacked, detention 'em (whack)
We send hits, ain't missing 'em
Bought another Cullinan (Cullinan)
Bulletproof like government
Grew up with my brother 'nem (big bruh)
Big bruh always hustling (hey)
Since my brother got killed, it ain't no fighting, it ain't no tussling (pistol)
Fighting in the courthouse, for my kids, I need some custody (hey)
Niggas fake, they counterfeit (fake)
Money boost my confidence
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate)
I get checks, I'm corporate
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (houses)
Sometimes when I'm home, I feel alone, like it's a orphanage (alone, hey, hey)
When it's cold outside, you better grip on your heat (cold)
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the street (let's go)
I ain't graduate college
White ceramic AP (white) black ceramic AP (black)
That's four hundred a piece (four hundred)
If I front, that's a fee
When I pulled out the chopper, he act like he couldn't speak (hey)
I been focused on me (let's go)
Hundred racks in the brief (let's go) I had shackles on feet
I adapt in the street (adapt)
I drip sauce in my sleep (drip, sauce)
Baddest bitch on my arm, niggas wish they was me (was me)
I'ma do niggas wrong, they was doubting on me
Niggas fake, they counterfeit (fake)
Money boost my confidence (boost)
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate)
I get checks, I'm corporate (checks)
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (houses)
Sometimes when I'm home, I feel alone, like it's a orphanage (alone, hey, hey)
When it's cold outside, you better grip on your heat
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the street
Do everything B-I-G, you niggas babies to me (talk)
Treat that lil' boy like my son, it's a switch on my glee (whoop)
I ain't texting no ho nothing, you might spill all the tea (no)
Quick to leave a bitch on seen, reckless messaging me (right now)
Rich nigga with broke habits, driving a Maybach on E (skkrr)
They just booked me for two hundred, spent that shit on my teeth (say cheese)
Certified player, ain't no referee, you O.D. (How)
She say I be pouring too much of that lean
VVSE every color when these diamonds hit the light (bright)
They just gave me 15 Ms, ain't do nothing but rap my life (true)
Everybody got opinions, telling me to spend it right (what)
You ain't never had this much money, I can't take your advice
I done rode more PJs than I put on PJs (haha)
Might just drop same time my opp, nigga fuck your release date
Been had them shoes some months ago before you put on them Js (late)
I can show you how to get paid, I know a hundred some ways (go)
Niggas fake, they counterfeit (fake)
Money boost my confidence (boost)
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate)
I get checks, I'm corporate (checks)
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (houses)
Sometimes when I'm home, I feel alone, like it's a orphanage (alone, hey, hey)
When it's cold outside, you better grip on your heat
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the street
