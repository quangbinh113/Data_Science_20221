Song Name: Drop It Like It's Hot
Snoop

Snoop
When the pimp's in the crib ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at ya
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Sean Don
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on, uh
I'm a nice dude (uh), with some nice dreams (yeah)
See these ice cubes? (Hm), see these ice creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat
The phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this could be your Phys. Ed.
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer wit' the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit' the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill ya vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P
When the pimp's in the crib ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at ya
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Sean Don
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da big boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
"Two!" "One!" "Yep, three!"
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live (so don't)
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo
When the pimp's in the crib ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at ya
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Sean Don
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on
I'm a bad boy, wit' a lotta hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now nigga, stop that!
See mid shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get yo' issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose
When the pimp's in the crib ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at ya
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Sean Don
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on
