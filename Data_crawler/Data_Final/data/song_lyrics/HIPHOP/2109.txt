Song Name: Shimmy Shimmy Ya
Oh, fuck, you can't even sing
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang Killer Bees on a swarm
Rain on ya college ass, disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta have the one killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill now
Chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any 52 states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam, flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I get down
(I like the way you come)
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Sh-Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang Killer Bees on a swarm
Rain on ya college ass, disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta have the one killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill now
Chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any 52 states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam, flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I get down
Sh-shimmy shimmy ya, yeah
Sh-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
