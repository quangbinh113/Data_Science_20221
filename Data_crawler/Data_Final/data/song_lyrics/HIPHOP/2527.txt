I'm back and don't give a fuck
Come play with Duke Deucifer
Back to getting the clubs Crunk
Get buck, if you think you tough
Buck, buck, what the fuck, get hit with the 12 slugs
',Bout action no capin', I'm packin' and macin', but stomped 'em like a dam rug
Triple M, Triple M, Triple M, bitch
Told you hoes, don't fuck with them
Criminals, criminals, criminals, bitch
Hell yeah, bitch I buck with them
Drop a stack on ya hat
You a mo'fuckin' rat
Let them cats put your ass on your mo'fuckin' back
It's a bird it's a plane, hell no, it's a pack
That's a fact, I'm a Mac, I ain't never gon' slack
I talked to my witch, and she said I'ma blow-up
Sacrifice my friends, I'll be wealthy but so lonesome
Lord, I'm so gifted I see things before they come up
Ancestors protecting me, so I always be one up
What the fuck!
G I live, G I die, ain't shit gon' change, you know me hoe, aye, aye
Buck, buck, buck, here I come, Mr. Memphis Massacre
G I live, G I die, ain't shit gon' change, you know me hoe
Buck, buck, buck, here I come, Mr. Memphis Massacre
G I live, G I die, ain't shit gon' change, you know me hoe (get buck!)
Buck, buck, buck, here I come, Mr. Memphis Massacre (get buck!)
G I live, G I die, ain't shit gon' change, you know me hoe (get buck!)
Buck, buck, buck, here I come, Mr. Memphis Massacre (get buck!)
Psychopath, deucifer
Looking like Lucifer
Got me buck wild, and I think I'm influenced
05, 01, 1992 far from a coward boy, buck like a bull
Memphis my city
Black haven the illest
We known for then killings
They say that we're cruel
Saturday night, we be pimpin' on Beale Street
Plenty freak hoes for niggas to pull
Drippin' no droppin'
Strap tight with that glocky
These hoes on my dick, 'cause I'm clean as a deacon
Back in the day, hoe you know you wouldn't talk to me
Watch I walk pass ya, no I'm not speaking
Not trying to compare myself into Jesus
God got me walking this earth for a reason
Duke Deuce, he cool till he turn to a demon
See that they dead, but why you keep squeezing
Steady dropping nukes
Lord, what they gon' do?
When I take the game over for the twenty deuce deuce
Pull up in a coop, no roof with my troops
Fuck niggas gon" poof cause they know they gon' shoot
Still ridin' clean, getting neck like a crew
While you fuck niggas hating with your lame ass crew
Made men mafia
Ain't no blocking us
Say fuck us, it's been fuck you bitch!
