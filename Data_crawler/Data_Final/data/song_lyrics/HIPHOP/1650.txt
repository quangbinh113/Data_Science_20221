Lock in the bando, I don't need nothing but water
The baking soda, then I whip 'til it's harder
I popped out the crib with your lil' bitty daughter
I fucked and then put that lil' ho on the MARTA
The Bentley, the 'Rari, I swap with the Benz
Parked the Rolls car, then I hopped in sedan
I just had got that lil' bitch from my mans
So I was fuckin' that hoe with my chain in my hand
All gold Rollie with an off-white tan
My son got a Saint Laurent ring on his hand
I just copped some molly, it was looking like sand
Shittin' on you niggas, wanna keep this shit stainless
I was kicking my shit like Jackie Chan
Peanut butter wrist, fuck a nigga saying?
Take it off his wrist, serve a nigga strand
Look at my neck and my wrist from pan
Big face Patek with a chocolate band (yeah)
Look at my wrist, don't take no dance (take no dance)
Bought an aircraft, I landed on land (land)
Luger Lex flex, 200 on sedan (200)
35 hundred on blue jean pants (swag)
Yeah, Chrome Heart brand (Chrome)
Throw the money up, barely pop another band (pop another tag)
Bitch pussy poppin' on the stand (woah)

Pretty bitches OD, and all of 'em getting ran (all of 'em getting ran)
Fuck all the police, free my dawg out the can (woah)
Whip top off the V, double cup in my hand (skrrt)
