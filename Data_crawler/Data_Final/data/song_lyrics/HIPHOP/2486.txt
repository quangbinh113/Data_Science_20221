Song Name: The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)
Me, I'm supa fly
Supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window)
Supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window)
Supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I, I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window)
When the rain hits my window
I take and - me some Indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight, that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
"Can we get kinky tonight?" Like Coko, so-so
You don't wanna play with my Yo-Yo
I smoke my hydro on the D-low
I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I-I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Beep, beep, who got the keys to the Jeep? Vroom
I'm driving to the beach
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be
It be me, me, me and Timothy
Look like it's 'bout to rain, what a shame
I got the Armor-All to shine up the stain
Oh, Missy, try to maintain
Ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I-I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
I feel the wind, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten (nine, ten)
Begin, I sit on hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts, coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, yes, you lucky, yes, you lucky (I can't stand the rain)
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I-I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain (can you stand the rain? Can you stand the rain?)
I can't stand the rain (what? Can you stand the rain?)
I can't stand the rain (can you stand the rain? Can you stand the rain?)
I can't stand the rain (what?)
Against my window, I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I-I can't stand the rain
Against my window, I can't stand the rain (why not, break it down like that)
Against my window, I can't stand the rain (yeah, like that)
I can't stand the rain (misdemeanor)
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
