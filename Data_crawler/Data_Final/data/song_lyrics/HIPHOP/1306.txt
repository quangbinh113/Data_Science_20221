Song Name: ALONE (feat. Trippie Redd)
Foreign car outside, I feel like Bruce Wayne
Baby, I'm a Gemini, that's why my mood swing
Pull up to the block, kick shit like Liu Kang
I got superpowers, making plays, lil' bitch, I do things
I've been pourin' Wock' and Tussion' in my Kool-Aid
In that center lane doing 150, I'm switchin' lanes
Tired of being tired, I'm gettin' high
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone
She won't let me go, but I know it's time for me to be alone
Mags on me like Rolling Stone, white girl like Post Malone (woo!)
In the bank, nigga, get low, kick in doors, give me all the dough
Money bag, cash in my coat, fuck 12, murder nigga hoes
Just me all inside of my mind, I just want time
Angels and demons my mind (my mind, my body)
Chrome Heart with a Velcro, yeah
Foreign car, nigga, let's go (woo!)
When my chopper hit, I won't fuckin' miss (yeah)
Foreign car outside, I feel like Bruce Wayne
Baby, I'm a Gemini, that's why my mood swing
Pull up to the block, kick shit like Liu Kang
I got superpowers, making plays, lil' bitch, I do things
I've been pourin' Wock' and Tussion' in my Kool-Aid
In that center lane doing 150, I'm switchin' lanes
Tired of being tired, I'm gettin' high
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone (I won't let it go)
Without you, you left me all alone
