Song Name: Seasons Change (feat. Tory Lanez)
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Renegade, Renegade, Renegade
Cruisin' down on Biscayne with her, ayy
She ain't fuckin' with no lame
She let me fuck her in the summer, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
Ayy, tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Tryna see if it's the same, ayy, yeah
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
Yeah, the reasons change like seasons change, yeah
If money talks, then please explain, yeah
It's more than words that we exchange, yeah
You wanna ride? It can be arranged, yeah
That thing wetter than Key Biscayne, yeah
And I deliver like a piece of chain
I came through drippin' like she's a drain
And I'm drippin' in ice like freezin' rain, yeah
Busy tonight, ain't gotta work tomorrow (Work tomorrow)
Come take it easy, you've been workin' hard (Workin' hard)
What if I said you ain't gotta twerk at bars?
You could quit tonight and call your
Boss and jerk them all (Jerk them all)
Would it still be the same with her?
You know it's hard to get her back once the game get her
Add the hustle, trips, and watches too, the swag
Gotta shout out to the single ladies faithful to that bag
Tory, what we doin'?
Cruisin' down on Biscayne with her, ayy
She ain't fuckin' with no lame
She let me fuck her in the summer, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
Ayy, tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Tryna see if it's the same, ayy, yeah
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
They was cuffin' all winter, now they single in the summer
Everybody booed up, they were singin' in the summer
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas in the summer
Got me in my feelings like Shiggy in the summer
I found out Kiki didn't love me, she ain't been ridin'
She just been hidin', sprinter door slidin' (Slidin')
That's how she bumped into her other dude
And now her other dude see her with another dude
And her other dude cool with her another dude
I won't even talk about the other other dude (Other dude)
This some She's Gotta Have It shit
Some Nola and her niggas Thanksgiving savage shit
Some Russell Westbrook triple-double average shit
But for me to give a shit I gotta have the shit (Have the shit)
Thought I had you but I had to learn
I ain't have you, I just had my turn, yeah
Cruisin' down on Biscayne with her, ayy
She ain't fuckin' with no lame
She let me fuck her in the summer, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
Ayy, tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Tryna see if it's the same, ayy, yeah
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her, ayy
Just tryna see if it's the same, ooh
Just tryna see if it's the same with her
Summer, summer, summertime
