Song Name: Shock Da World
Pipe that shit up, TnT
(Jai Beats on the track, boy)
Shh, shh
Yeah, look, look, look, uh
I tried to motivate the people but I made 'em angry
I tried to show 'em it was all love, that made 'em hate me
They criticize me and talk bad 'bout me on the daily
I get the money and stay out the way, they think I'm crazy
Maybe if I weren't built for this, I'd let it phase me
Can't bend or fold, my folks dependin' on for me to make it
I'm ATR for life, the leader of the fucking navy
This HitHouse entertainment, baby, we all drive Mercedes
It's crazy, we came a long way to get to this
I opened up about my pain, let the world in
I know exactly how it feels to come out the bottom
How the hell you hate on somebody with so much in common?
Stay to myself and get these dollars
Take care grandma, take care mama
Get the bread and feed my partners
Never hear my name in drama
I'm focused on these commas
Fuck a bitch, I love my kids, they grandmama, and they mama
Don't care about no followers
I made my first million way before I made it big
I made my second million way before I made my kids
My third and fourth million, I made 'em the same night
My fifth million, made 'em when they platinumed "Heart on Ice"
On the phone with the lawyer talkin' bout my next five (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look, if I could make ten, then I can make a hunnid
Then I can make a billion, we turned nothing into something, yeah
The youngest out my city but the dumbest out my city (out my city)
Youngin' ran up some millies, ain't have to dickride to get it
And I still fuck with Gates but sometimes I'm in my feelings
I know that it's been a minute, I hope your heart finish healing
It was a long, long, dark road
But still he got so far to go
Look how he shocked the world
Look how he put the odds to rest, look how he overcame
Look how he showed you he the best still
You ain't seen nothing yet
You ain't seen nothing yet, yeah (I swear, ayy)
You ain't seen nothing yet, yeah
Look how he shocked the world
Look how he put the odds to rest, look how he overcame
Look how he showed you he the best still
You ain't seen nothing yet (still goin', I promise)
You ain't seen (fuck you) nothing yet, yeah (if you hate me, fuck you, you feel me?)
Grrah
Grrah, bah, bah, bah, bah
