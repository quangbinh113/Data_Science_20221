Song Name: Waterfall Flow
Baby, this that waterfall flow
Baby, this that waterfall flow
Certain shit I'm not fascinated with, I can't fake this shit
My legs made for a money run, I can't chase a bitch
When the tab come, we don't gotta split it, bro, I'm gon' pay the shit
Somewhere in Toronto with a Canadian
Used to have no one to call on, now I fill up stadiums
Oh, you can't be fucked with? Young and turnt, come get with Baby'nem
You supposed to be with us, but you switched up, you gotta stay with them
I ran up a dub in just two months, told you, "Don't play with him"
This shit getting crazy
I'm workin' double time, this summer mine, I'm not just saying this
We did too much to just be gang, I really treat him like family
I'm not a fraud, I make a lot of noise, that's why they can't stand me
You piss me off, we going to war and I ain't got no understanding
Waterfall flow 'cause I just keep flowing, yeah
She told me she coming, so I keep going, oh yeah
Really tryna win? You gotta sacrifice
Bro'nem was getting rich, I felt I had to try it
I took a little piece and went and maximized it
I took my little fans I had and amplified 'em
This shit don't come free but you can't go and buy it
Ain't into the clout but I stay going viral
You ain't really down then you can't come around us
Forever with the one that I'ma do or die with
Phantom doors came suicide, used to have to catch a ride
I ain't trying to go too deep, maybe we can catch a vibe
Maybe we can slide, depending on what your plans like
I might play it quiet but you know that I'm the man, right?
You gon' have to pick a side, come here, let me pick your mind
You can tell me all your flaws, I'll get someone to fix your body
She love when I thug and like when I get romantic
She wanna be gang, I got her doing our handshake
I been doing all of this shit from the top of my head
If you're ready to cross the line then I ain't gon' stop you, go ahead
But I just hope that you're prepared, I been accepted life ain't fair
We used to ship from here and there, my mama done had to sign for mail
Never let a ho play with my heart, I went through that in jail
Can't believe I gotta put that fire on bro, we been through hell
You ain't gangster, I know damn well if they catch you, you gon' tell
I ain't have no help, I made everybody happy by myself
But I did have a plug and my fans though
Know they want me to lay down but I got something to stand for
This shit in me, it ain't on me, I can't never get canceled
I ain't trippin' about the price, I gotta get what I'm paying for
It's the principle
Phantom doors came suicide, used to have to catch a ride
I ain't trying to go too deep, maybe we can catch a vibe
Maybe we can slide, depending on what your plans like
I might play it quiet but you know that I'm the man, right?
You gon' have to pick a side, come here, let me pick your mind
You can tell me all your flaws, I'll get someone to fix your body
She love when I thug and like when I get romantic
She wanna be gang, I got her doing our handshake
