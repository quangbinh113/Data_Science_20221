Song Name: Maneuver (feat. Flo Milli)
What's the maneuver
(What's the maneuver)
I just pulled up
To go pick up a bag
And I ride with a shooter
Yea
Always knew my time was money
I went to go get me a watch from the jeweler
(Ice)
Still can't believe that these bitches take time out they day
To hate from a computer
Hatin' ass hoe
She a loser
Loser
Uhh
What's the maneuver
(What's the maneuver)
Touch down in yo city
They say that it's litty
We pullin' up to you
And you know that's on my word
I just touched down
Got them racks on me fasho
Feeling like I might blow up tonight
Fuck what you heard
Please do not come at me wrong
Bitch you better go get it right
Uhh
Bitch better go get it right
You know I'm cold
Bitch I'm covered in ice
(On God)
Fuck you mean
I ain't that nice
This shit ain't no luck
Bitch

(Twice)
Leaving all these bitches pissed
Way I'm throwing these fits
Only wear that shit once for the pic
What's the maneuver
Pull up
McLaren
Mercedes Benz when I hit the event
(What's the maneuver)
Uhh
Bust down AP
With a big face
Who you know with a chip
On a mixtape
(Flex)
Try me

Hoes couldn't fuck with me on an off day
