Song Name: Kill My Vibe
Yeah
Okay, kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Smoking right, it don't lie
I been that nigga, like this whole time
Alarm clock, nigga was sleep 'til I iced my wrist
Now my charm's up
Street shit, that's my genre
Sippin' this drank like Starbucks
'Less you sharin' them cookies, babe
What the fuck you got in this car for? We grown
I keep a secret, fuck it, send you back home to your people
My nigga trappin', and swipin' the Visa
Stackin' and flippin' you know the pro-cedure
Now he shakin' like a seizure
Say you ballin', but we don't believe ya'
Bought the champagne for achievement
Shoot the pistol, just give me a reason, oh
Okay, kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
I'm so high, I'm so fly, I'm so lit
Man, my jeweler ice me like a game of freeze tag, and I'm it
Y'all niggas duck-duck-goose
Your bitch love me, and I love her too
She text me heart, ass, and a tongue emoji
I bend it over, enjoy the moment
Then catch a flight
Hating niggas like bugs, the crib full of pesticides
I'm gettin' extra racks, I rep the set for life, yeah, yeah
We got the streets on lock, eternal sleep for opps
Taught to pull up and and cock
V12 what we slide, they wanna kill a nigga vibe
Okay, kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Okay, kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
Kill my vibe, yeah, yeah
You gon' die, yeah, yeah
Wrist on ice, ain't it nice?
Fuck the price, yeah, yeah
