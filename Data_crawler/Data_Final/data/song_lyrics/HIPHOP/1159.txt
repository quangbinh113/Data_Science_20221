Song Name: Sno Cone (feat. Quavo & Gucci Mane)
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone (two-tone)
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (icy)
Hop out a skate on a gun line (rah)
Don't talk on the phone, no Facetime (brr)
Came from the streets to the baseline
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
(I go snowcone)
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (slide)
But I don't got skates on, yeah
Guwop from the streets, I never ever been the commercial type (no)
Lil' ice right in 'em PJs (ice), he won't ever rock commercial flights (damn)
Thinking 'bout the shit I did that kept my momma up at night (mom)
Thinking 'bout them drugs I took, them bitches kept me up at night (well, damn)
Used to want a hundred mill', that shit, it sends so far away (ar)
Now I stash a hundred mil' away just for a rainy day (wow)
Rolls-Royce umbrella in my Phantom in case it rain today (rose)
This one for my niggas drankin' tryna chase the pain away (drankin')
Niggas be wishin' we switchin' positions, they want me back up in the kitchen (skrrt)
Niggas be snitchin' and actin' like bitches, that's why they get found on them ditches (yeah)
From trenches to riches, this shit is tradition, we ballin' out through the pandemic (go)
This ain't no publicity stunt, this shit ain't no gimmick, this shit ain't no image (style)
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone (two-tone)
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (icy)
Hop out a skate on a gun line (rah)
Don't talk on the phone, no Facetime (rrr)
Came from the streets to the baseline
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
(I go snowcone)
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (slide)
But I don't got skates on, yeah
New Cartier dancin' hard in the dark
Couldn't trap out the house so I sold all the block
Who ever knew I'd be at the top in the A?
In the stu', it's me, Quavo and Wop
I put the hood on my back, can't stop
Neck so icy and look at the watch
Designer, it cost for the throne and the sauce
Snowcone, iced out, look how I talk
Pulled up, Rolls coupe, pile rolled off in the golden, no chop chop, came with the stop
Reach at a nigga, Fizzle knockin' 'em off, couldn't fuck now, I'm up, bitch tryna come off
18, how you so poppin' and raw?
Two-tone one, I'm hard, one soft
Snowcone, I don't want one, I want both arms
My FN all black look like a play gun
Expresser I'm with it, you with it just say some'
Ain't with the arguin' and braggin', don't say much
Been with the same one with it since day one
Trapped out the PJ, really how I come
You would be done if you think I won't spray none
Runnin' with killers and dealers like Doe Boy
Even my momma know Fizzle a dope boy
Ice on everything, it look like a snow storm
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone (two-tone)
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (icy)
Hop out a skate on a gun line (rah)
Don't talk on the phone, no Facetime (brr)
Came from the streets to the baseline
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
(I go snowcone)
Snowcone watch, F&N two-tone
Pull up in the coupe with no roof on (skrrt)
Went straight out the mud with no boots on (mud)
I took out the white and count blues on it (what?)
Niggas so icy, I gotta slide (slide)
But I don't got skates on, yeah
