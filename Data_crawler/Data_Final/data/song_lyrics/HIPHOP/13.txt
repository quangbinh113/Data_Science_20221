Song Name: 24 Hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
I'm sinnin'
4 in the mornin', the windows tinted
I'm ridin'
Had to leave the crib 'cause the police knockin'
Can't stop me
Mama had a dream that the police shot me
Who got me?
Can't trust nobody, my best friend robbed me
I'm 'bout it
Melo in the whip, no ring, I'm silent
No options
Focus on this money 'cause I dropped out of college
I wildin'
Warrants got me goin' back to Cali like Wallace
I'm drivin'
Pedal to the metal when I'm screamin'...
Fuck a .45, speed it up, let's get high
Touch the sky, live it up, for the night, go tomorrow
Livin' fast, dyin' young, with a smile
'Cause if I die, I lived it up, yeah
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
I'm in it
Ain't no lookin' back, I'm in it
I'm winnin'
Investors, you all in my business
I'm different
My girl Egyptian, speak no English
She trippin'
She said she miss me, but it's so hard
To say goodbye
To yesterday
To yesterday
But for now I'm screaming
Fuck a .45, speed it up, let's get high
Touch the sky, live it up, for the night, go tomorrow
Livin' fast, dyin' young, with a smile
'Cause if I die, I lived it up, yeah
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
We got the same 24 hours
If you can do it better than me, then do it, mothafucka
4 in the morning
I'ma take this Hennessy to my face until I'm gone
'Til I'm gone
It's 4 in the morning
I'ma roll this Backwood to my face until I feel I'm gone
'Til I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
