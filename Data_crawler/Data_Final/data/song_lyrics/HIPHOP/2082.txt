Song Name: Check Yo Self - Remix
Yeah
(So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self)
Check
Yeah...
You better check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cuz I'm bad for your health
I come real stealth droppin' bombs on ya moms
Fuck car alarms
Doin' foul crime, I'm that nigga wit'cha Alpine
Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No, I'm not a sucker, sittin' in a house of pain
And, no, I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Head butt 'ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya', punk motherfucka'
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me Dough Boy
This ain't no fuckin' motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, my nigga get witcha
And hit ya, takin' that yack to the neck
So you better run a check
So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Yeah, come on and check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health
Chickity-check
Chickity-check
Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
'Cause they bitch may pullin' out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, 'cause that's a knife-o
AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
Got a new style, watch out now
I hate motherfuckers claimin' that they foldin' bank
But steady talkin' shit in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screamin' for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they runnin' up in ya slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin' your eyes and neck
You better run a check
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Big dicks in yo ass is bad for yo health
Chickity-check
Punk
Chickity-check
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I got six and I'm aimin' 'em
Will I bust or keep you guessin'
And fuck you and that shit ya stressin'
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit
Sprung niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
'Cause bitches like you is bad for my health
Chickity check
Punk
Chickity check
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
'Cause the lynch mob is bad for your health
