Song Name: GO (feat. Juice WRLD)
Okay, go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
Go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
I don't know no better (I don't)
I just wan' get into things, I just want mine better (Nah)
You fuck up my brain, you don't know no better, yeah (Okay)
Wish I knew you better, but I don't know no better
So I keep doing what I know best, yeah
You're really good at fucking with me, girl, I'll give it to you (I will)
But I am out here doing this for me and not for you
I done fucked around and got attached, damn, I'm so with you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to
And I should slide for you
And that's my biggest problem, in denial 'bout you
Tonight, I'll go open up the night for you
Probably die for you, fuck around and lie for you
Probably cry for you
Okay, go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
Go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
Woah, woah, woah
Perky with the lean, it got me slow, slow, slow
And yeah, I know I made a few mistakes before
But you know I ain't fucking with these hoes no more
Won't let go, I'm the type to show you that you're too special
Please don't be the type to hate the things I do
And I'll ride for you, and I'll die for you
Homicide for you
And I should slide for you
And that's my biggest problem, in denial 'bout you
Tonight, I'll go open up the night for you
Probably die for you, fuck around and lie for you
Probably cry for you
Okay, go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
Go, go, go
She always be talking like she know, know, know
I told her don't ever leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, oh
