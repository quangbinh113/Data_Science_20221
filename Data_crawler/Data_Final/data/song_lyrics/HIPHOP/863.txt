Song Name: Take It To Trial (feat. Yak Gotti)
Wheezy outta here
Worth a couple hundred mil', no thousand
This bitch wanna fuck me but I charge by the hour
My neck and my wrist in the shower
Like how the fuck you growin' up and baby, say you childish?
I just bought my young bitch a watch and now she wildin'
Stylin', profilin', you bitches can't devour it
And I'm Creflo Dollar smilin'
We somewhere on a island, vibin'
Balls smell like powder (let's go)
Fuck it, take it to trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Slimе green AP look like herpes on my wrist, uh
Hold on, cook, woo, I'm so Chеf Boyardee with that dish
I don't know you, bitch, don't try to tell me tie my kicks
Talkin' 'bout chips, ain't talkin' no dip
See, my baby mama trippin', she don't get it
I'm on a mission to get these millions
I'm on the grind and I'ma get it
No cap, nigga, no kizzy
Slime 'em out, then they 'gon tell 'em I ain't listen
Once he call, he gon' say that I'm trippin'
You ain't slime, that's just how I feel, nope
You do not meet the criteria, nope
I rep my life for real (yeah)
That's your first time, for real? (Yeah)
For slimes, you know I'll kill (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bye-bye, goodnight, my dear
Trial, I done beat it twice (trial)
State, I'm undefeated like
Feds came and snatched me, I don't know, no point in asking
I was on Bleveland stuck like a magnet
Bitch ass nigga, I'll shoot at your mammy
Need to sit down if you can't stand me
I don't turn down, I up my stamina
Take it to trial, get an appeal
Take it to trial, yeah, you can whack 'em
No back and forth, we don't tongue wrestle
Pay for that casket, that's just if we whack 'em
Yeah, yeah (let's go)
My young niggas pullin' up Bentleys, Aston Martins, 'Raris, and Teslas (let's go)
Strapped with an FN, choppas, carbines, know some steppers (let's go)
Got ice, not in no fridge, not in the safe, look like treasure (let's go)
We fuck, have a lot of sex, and her head feel like pleasure (oh)
Shawty super slurpy, suck that Birky out that dick (oh, wow)
Maybach came with curtains and I still went, got it tint (on God)
YSL slimy and shady, they ain't wavy like my clique (wavy)
High-end alterations, did that European stitch
Fuck niggas get hit, I got me an opp list
I'm quick to switch topics, uh, no way I can snitch (no way)
Watch me whack that bitch, uh, pop 'em like a cyst, uh
Glock with the assist
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfuckin' trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
