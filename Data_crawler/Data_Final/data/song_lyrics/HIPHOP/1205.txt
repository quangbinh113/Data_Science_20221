Song Name: â€˜87 Stingray
Woah, yeah, eh, eh
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Baby, baby girl
Fillin' me up, fill me with love, yeah, yeah
You give me a feeling I don't wanna lose, no, baby girl, no-no
It's fillin' me up, it's fillin' me up, yeah, yeah
The feeling, it feels like
I'm ridin' through the city
Liquor spillin' like a faucet
Phone calls to my baby
She know what be goin' on
I check in on the late night
Lord knows that I'm wrong
For cheatin' on you in the late night
Can't seem to leave alone
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Baby, baby girl
You givin' me something that I don't feel too often
You givin' me something I wanna taste, touch, tease, oh, believe me
But baby, I don't wanna lose it
I don't wanna lose it, no
I'm ridin' through the city
Liquor spillin' like a faucet
Phone calls to my baby
She know what be goin' on
I check in on the late night
Lord knows that I'm wrong
For cheatin' on you in the late night
Can't seem to leave alone
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
