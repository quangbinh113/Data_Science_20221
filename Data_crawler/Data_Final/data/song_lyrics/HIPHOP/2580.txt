Song Name: Cruise Control
Livin' in a world so cold
Keep a nigga on ten toes
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, "I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control"
Uh, 30 million by age 30
Motivated to reach my goal, trust me, I ain't worried
'Bout weak-minded bitches and hoes
These low-life niggas who ain't got no self-control
Been feeling hungry and they just ain't feedin' my soul
I had to let go a lotta of people that
I really thought were there for me were just in my way
Holdin' on the fact of what we used to be back in the day
Niggas ain't gon' meet me halfway, I ain't finna wait
Had to cut the deadweight just so I can elevate and levitate
Now let me set the record straight
Every day, I meditate 'cause I'm the one they love to hate
Focused on the bigger picture, tryna find a better way
'Cause I ain't finna cut myself short
Money gettin' longer but happiness never been bought
The type of shit I'll teach to my daughter never was taught
To me when I was younger 'cause that shit wasn't even a thought
Livin' in a world so cold (so cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, "I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control"
Livin' in a world so cold (so cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, "I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control"
Droppin' my top down on cruise control
Droppin' my top down on cruise control
It was all a dream, came in this at 17
Me and my Pro Era team focused on the better things
Tryna stack cheddar, cream, rule everything
Foot up on the pedal and never settlin'
Uh, I'm full steam ahead of them, ten-year veteran, how you figure?
Name a nigga that I ain't better than, my flow iller
Still it's the cure like medicine, the cold killer
Glock's tucked inside the letterman by Pro Era
I swear this shit couldn't be more clearer
It's like I'm lookin' through a whole mirror
I could see the vision, so I live like it's my last day
And everything I want just tryna meet me halfway
I try to stay calm but niggas tryna blast me
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay, so I stay
On the alarm, 'cause I ain't tryna go the fast way
It's a marathon, you can't treat it like a drag race
Yo, what's your name again?
I know you from where? High school?
I don't know you man
Loser
Livin' in a world so cold (so cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, "I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control"
Livin' in a world so cold (so cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, "I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control
Droppin' my top down on cruise control ('trol, 'trol, 'trol, 'trol)
Droppin' my top down on cruise control ('trol, 'trol, 'trol, 'trol)
Ladies and gentlemen
Your man, Mr. Nasir Jones, is proud to present my man, Jo-Vaughn

Wise man, this man has age on him, like he's been here before
Yet he's a young king, ya heard?
Everybody in the back quiet down, get ready for some real shit
