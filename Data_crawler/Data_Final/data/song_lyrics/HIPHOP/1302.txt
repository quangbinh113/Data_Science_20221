Song Name: My World (Intro)
Ayy, you know sometimes I be, I be shaking
Sometimes it's, it's with my demons and shit, you know?
Yeah
Ayy, I shake, I shackle, I battle all my demons (why?)
In the mornin' I be fiendin', in the sleepin', I be dreamin' (why?)
What you know about this sadness? Even though I'm in a different planet (why?)
There's Mars and Earth and Venus, everywhere I go, it's a magnet
Down bad, I'ma tilt the axis
Do you wanna believe in magic? I don't think so, you might vanish (uh-huh)
My bad, I don't want it to happen, niggas want my clout and status (why?)
Got a Glock with a knife and a hatchet, smoke a blunt with the leaf in thе packet (packet)
Got a blade and a Monclеr jacket, when I die can you paint my casket? (Woah)
With the black paint in the basket
Say my name out loud in traffic, bullet hit your soul in fractions
Blue jeans with the Louis fashion, I'ma take your bitch, I'm handsome
I'ma take your girl, no ransom, I'ma take your bitch, you random (whoa)
Ayy, I shake, I shackle, I battle all my demons (why?)
In the mornin' I be fiendin', in the sleepin', I be dreamin' (why?)
What you know about this sadness? Even though I'm in a different planet (why?)
There's Mars and Earth and Venus, everywhere I go, it's a magnet
Ayy, I shake, I shackle, I battle all my demons (why?)
In the mornin' I be fiendin', in the sleepin', I be dreamin' (why?)
What you know about this sadness? Even though I'm in a different planet (why?)
There's Mars and Earth and Venus, everywhere I go, it's a magnet
I'ma take off in a rocket, and the bands inside my wallet
Can't fit inside my pocket, keep it real, lil' nigga, be solid
Lil' bitch, don't lie, be honest, niggas always wanna talk and gossip
Man down, man down, man down, I don't think they hear me, slow it down
Ayy, I shake, I shackle, I battle all my demons (why?)
In the mornin' I be fiendin', in the sleepin', I be dreamin' (why?)
What you know about this sadness? Even though I'm in a different planet (why?)
There's Mars and Earth and Venus, everywhere I go, it's a magnet
Down bad, I'ma tilt the axis (why?)
Do you wanna believe in magic?
