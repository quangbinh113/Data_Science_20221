Song Name: Diamonds Dancing (feat. Travis Scott)
All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch
I'm Martin Luther King, black diamonds on my wrist (run that back, Turbo)
Put Giuseppes on my kids, put Chanel Coco on my bitch
Put that .44 on the switch, then you cock, pop-pop, then dip
I've been in the trenches, the trap, to be specific
I fell in love with my bitches, then sold 'em for some riches
This money be my missus, drive me crazy, I need Ritalin
I told 'em, "I'm so slimy, I'm so shady, I admit it, yeah"
Slatt like to shoot, slatt like to murk
21 gun salute, baow, drilling, putting in work, yeah
Cut his tonsils out, woo, I said it'd hurt, ayy
Keep a new .44, yeah, let it burst
Pockets Honey Kettle, keep on pedal
Get my own cheddar, all my dogs better
Honeycomb bezel, we make opps jitter
Maison Margielas, cases get settled
Here, clean the cookie off, family, Travis, the Scotts
Serving the bags, I'm cooking the stove
Came in the spot and we serving with soap
I was just spazzing, finding the flow
I'm with some Crips, down with some Locs
Hand in the pot, I'm with some Bloods
How many slatts? Leave it to us
Yeah, counting racks, smoking on pot
Yeah, I upgraded my thot
Yeah, I upgraded my spots
Yeah, thots chickened out
Woo, yeah, the spots upgraded, now them bitches chickened out
Hey, 35 burnt hundreds on my pocket watch
All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch
I'm Martin Luther King, black diamonds on my wrist
Put Giuseppes on my kids, put Chanel Coco on my bitch
Put that .44 on the switch, then you cock, pop-pop, then dip
I've been in the trenches, the trap, to be specific
I fell in love with my bitches, then sold 'em for some riches
This money be my missus, drive me crazy, I need Ritalin
I told 'em, "I'm so slimy, I'm so shady, I admit it, yeah"
