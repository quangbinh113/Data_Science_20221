Song Name: Show U Off
KidWond3r, you made this beat? Damn
I really, I really wanna show you off, girl
I'm a young street nigga, I know you heard of me
I love your conversation, sit down and talk to me, girl
I wanna love you physically and mentally
You're the one, you're the one that saw the best of me, girl
Love you like no other, you mean the world to me
I don't really ask for none but love and affection
Baby girl, you gotta take good care of me
I'm really, I'm really so in love with you, girl
No, I don't ever need no substitute, girl
When I get off the tour, I got somethin' for you, girl
Put VVS diamonds on her, she don't do pearls
Run my bath water and cook my food
Times we say we hate each other when we love one another
You still gon' be my little sunshine in rainy weather
We can go where ever you'd like, baby, with me, it's whatever
She told that nigga that it's all me
And she gon' keep them bitches off me
I made her kill her haters softly
I told her, "Take this Gucci off me"
I really, I really wanna show you off, girl
I'm a young street nigga, I know you heard of me
I love your conversation, sit down and talk to me, girl
I wanna love you physically and mentally
You're the one, you're the one that saw the best of me, girl
Love you like no other, you mean the world to me
I don't really ask for none but love and affection
Baby girl, you gotta take good care of me
Cheat on me, I gotta go get a new girl (whoa)
No, I'm not the law but follow my rules, girl (whoa)
My shooter with me, know he go up the tool, girl (yeah)
We got Glocks and choppers and lot of Rugers
I cannot fuck when I got you too, girl (yeah)
Every other day, I run into new girls (yeah)
She said that I got money, count blue money, rule the world (uh)
She know I'm gon' get you back, I'm down with you, girl (whoa)
I really, I really wanna show you off, girl
A rockstar nigga, know you heard of me
I'm so fly, these bum ass niggas wanna murder me (damn)
I pick your bitch up in my whip, she give that service fee (skrrt)
I really, I really wanna show you off, girl
I'm a young street nigga, I know you heard of me
I love your conversation, sit down and talk to me, girl
I wanna love you physically and mentally
You're the one, you're the one that saw the best of me, girl
Love you like no other, you mean the world to me
I don't really ask for none but love and affection
Baby girl, you gotta take good care of me
I wanna see you in that bikini on that beach, girl
When I'm not next to you, I cannot get no sleep, girl
At night she stay up for me when I'm in street, uh
And when we make love, yeah, we soak up the sheets, girl
And she be throwin' fits every time I leave her
The last nigga didn't even know how to treat her
It's us against the world, just me and her
I'm pullin' on her hair while I freak her
I really, I really wanna show you off, girl
I'm a young street nigga, I know you heard of me
I love your conversation, sit down and talk to me, girl
I wanna love you physically and mentally
You're the one, you're the one that saw the best of me, girl
Love you like no other, you mean the world to me
I don't really ask for none but love and affection
Baby girl, you gotta take good care of me
Wanna show you off, off
Wanna show you off, girl
Wanna show you off, off
Wanna show you off, girl
