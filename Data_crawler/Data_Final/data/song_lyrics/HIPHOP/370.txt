Song Name: Mood Swings
Beast, beast
I'm a beast
Oh my God, mood swings
I don't like mood swings
All the time
I was broke, I don't cry
I'm a GOAT, I'm a God
I'm a beast, I'm a God, mmm, nigga, let that shit fly
Nigga you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, and my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wildin' yeah
She was my bestie, mmm, never knew she was so nasty, mmm, yeah
And she so sexy, mmm, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah
Ass so fat, oh, bouncin' up and down like a basketball, yeah
Niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga, treat him like Wesley, yeah
Bitch, I go Big 44, yeah, I know they don't want no smoke
Big faced watch, big bank rolls
Big ass bag with the big Lambo'
Bitch, I'm bad, young Mike, I'm a GOAT
Mike Amiri pants too tight for the pole
Me and my bestie fucked on the low
Can you still trust me? I don't know
No, I don't know, outta' time
I'm so caught out of line
Adderall in her ice
Lost my bro, lost my mind
Want my soul, niggas want my life
Tryna take my hoes, tryna fuck my wife
Mood swings, sometimes I need two at a time
Fuckin' two set of twins, ain't one of them shy
Fuck two set of 10s like a couple of dimes
Fuck two set of twins like a couple of times
Fuck few set of twins like a couple of times
Percocets, two time
Percocet, that new one comes
Percocets, two time
Percocet, that new one comes
I'm a Beast
Oh my God, mood swings
I don't like mood swings
All the time
I was broke, I don't cry
I'm a GOAT, I'm a God
I'm a beast, I'm a God, mmm, nigga let that shit fly
Nigga you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, and my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wildin' yeah
She was my bestie, mmm, never knew she was so nasty, mmm, yeah
And she so sexy, mmm, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah
Ass so fat, oh, bouncin' up and down like a basketball, yeah
Niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga, treat him like Wesley, yeah
