Song Name: Emergency (feat. Gunna & Young Thug)
Taurus
(Run that back, Turbo)
911 Porsche, it's emergency (ooh)
Kick in the door, it's a burglary (ooh)
Light his ass up, burnin' third-degree (ooh)
25 racks for a surgery (ooh)
I know you just actin' tough
When I really pull up, you gon' call the authorities (ooh)
I run it up, gotta see who I really can trust
'Cause these niggas ain't for me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm in the ring and my back 'gainst the ropes
I'm a young king and I'm keepin' 'em woke
Jumped off the porch, went and got what I want
Smokin' Biscotti, it smell like a skunk
Take care my mama and brother and nephews
Now what the fuck else is you payin' for?
I sat on the block, but didn't go to school of the hard knocks
And wasn't none of this planned for
I bought her the big body Jaguar
We pull up with sticks like a task force
It's 220 MP the dashboard
GunWunna, young Wunna a bad boy
Own business, I got me a company key
Go get it, I get it, ain't workin' for free
You wan' see that show, gotta pay you a fee
She want a big Birkin, the big Bentley B
I'm servin' this cash (yeah)
Come with it, we kill him, ain't no sympathy
Dig up the grass (yeah)
Then bury his body, don't nobody speak
911 Porsche, it's emergency (ooh)
Kick in the door, it's a burglary (ooh)
Light his ass up, burnin' third-degree (ooh)
25 racks for a surgery (ooh)
I know you just actin' tough
When I really pull up, you gon' call the authorities (ooh)
I run it up, gotta see who I really can trust
'Cause these niggas ain't for me (ooh)
I'm sippin' on purple, no Bape (21)
I put them racks on a plate (I did)
Say you want smoke, we gon' come where you stay
Take my gun everywhere, I'm from the A
We call her thottie, you callin' her bae
Every nigga try it, we slid on tape
Nigga playin' tough, got hit with the Drac'
Rich and paranoid, in the hills with a K
Nip it in the bud, I check that (21)
Your bitch in the vert, in my lap where her neck at
Pull up in your hood, we'll stretch that (straight up)
Your lil' nigga starvin', send him a care pack
First-time owner, no CARFAX (big facts)
We got the same kinda guns like Star Trek
Don't need no keys to start that (pussy)
So many hoes in this car, man, park that
911 Porsche, it's emergency (ooh)
Kick in the door, it's a burglary (ooh)
Light his ass up, burnin' third-degree (ooh)
25 racks for a surgery (ooh)
I know you just actin' tough
When I really pull up, you gon' call the authorities (ooh)
I run it up, gotta see who I really can trust (yeah, yeah)
'Cause these niggas ain't for me (ooh)
I call the play with the stick (call the play)
And my lil' ho got a kick (blatt)
She spent a night at the spot (fuck)
Then I had fed her some grits (let's go)
I had her sucking on cock (yeah)
I made her think that she rich, yeah
I gave a bitch lockjaws (lock)
I'm a real gangsta, no glitch (facts)
I just had hopped in a Mercury (slatt)
Then we had pulled up like four deep (SEX)
Bitch told me she was just pregnant
That little bitch, she can't have it, no extortin' me
I had to pick out my carats myself
And they yellow, the bitch like a bumblebee
I put the dope on the jet
And I fly to Seattle to meet me a Portuguese (turn up)
911 Porsche, it's emergency (ooh)
Kick in the door, it's a burglary (ooh)
Light his ass up, burnin' third-degree (ooh)
25 racks for a surgery (ooh)
I know you just actin' tough
When I really pull up, you gon' call the authorities (ooh)
I run it up, gotta see who I really can trust
'Cause these niggas ain't for me (ooh)
I call the play with the stick (call the play)
And my lil' ho got a kick (blatt)
I call the play with the stick (call the play)
And my lil' ho got a kick (blatt)
I call the play with the stick (call the play)
And my lil' ho got a kick (blatt)
I call the play with the stick (call the play)
And my lil' ho got a kick (blatt)
