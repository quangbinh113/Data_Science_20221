Song Name: Tunnel Vision (Outro)
Aha, homie like
Homie like, "Damn boy, you made it" (damn, damn)
But she said, "You ain't nice" (at all)
I'ma tell her I know I'm nice (look)
I don't talk to niggas (nah), I don't feel these niggas (at all)
Got a hundred round in my pocket, I'm ready to go kill these niggas
And it's tunnel vision (yeah)
When I'm in the field, nigga (in the field)
If I tell Mikey, "Woo" (woo), then he gon' go drill a nigga (grrt-bah)
I'm a Brooklyn nigga
But shout out my Philly niggas (my Philly niggas)
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas
Because I'm too real for niggas (yeah, nah)
They know what it means (yeah)
To have million dollar dreams (dreams)
Then you wake up on the block, and it's black to servin' fiends (yeah)
I don't drink Belaire (nah)
But I'm in Bel Air like I'm Uncle Phil
Don't call my bluff
Nigga, I am, and nigga, I will, look (nigga, I will)
And I'm from the fields, now it's million dollar deals
And it's all out of nowhere
Push me, and I'ma go in there, all in a second
Gun kickin' like its Tekken
I'm a force to be reckon, I'm God's perfection
Look, God gave me a lot in some months, but it could go in a second
If I fuck the wrong bitch or walk up in the wrong session
I don't talk to niggas (nah), I don't feel these niggas (at all)
Got a hundred round in my pocket, I'm ready to go kill these niggas
And it's tunnel vision (yeah)
When I'm in the field, nigga (in the field)
If I tell Mikey, "Woo" (woo), then he gon' go drill a nigga (grrt-bah)
I'm a Brooklyn nigga
But shout out my Philly niggas (my Philly niggas)
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas
Because I'm too real for niggas (yeah, nah)
They don't know what it means (yeah)
To have million dollar dreams (dreams)
Then you wake up on the block and
It's back to servin' fiends (yeah, nah)
Step it and ain't no changin' it, changin' it
Haha, now for who? Now for who?
What do you want your impact to be on the music industry?
Like a hundred years from now, how do you want people to remember you?
Pop Smoke did this, he did that, he did what?
Pop Smoke came in and changed the game
Pop Smoke came in and showed them niggas a new vibe
The whole sound, the whole vibe, the whole mood man
Different
Forever my heart, forever my dawgs
Still will put on for you
The smoke will never clear
Never
Woo, woo, woo, grrt-baow
