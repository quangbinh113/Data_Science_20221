Know how the fuck we bomin', nigga
More rings, more chains, nigga
Hey

Ayy
I spend it all, get it right back (What? Right back)
You niggas acting up, niggas showing off
Niggas not even like that (Niggas not even like that)
Gotta go run to the money,
I pick up a bag and I'm coming right back (Bitch)
Them niggas lookin' real funny
I'm whippin' the Jag,
I know they don't like that (Skrrt, Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Diamonds they dancin' like Mike Jack (What?)
I'm on a roll like dice (Hey)
You gotta pay that price (Yeah)
She give me face like Skype (Face like Skype)
I got an old man tight (Yeah)
I gotta ball like Mike (Hey)
VVS's dance, yeah they moonwalk (Ice)
I put the gang on ice
Runnin' to the bands, gotta cool off (Yeah, yeah)
I blow them racks when I'm pissed off (What?)
Pull out the Wraith, drop the top off (Skrrt)
You niggas is softer than cotton (Huh?)
Back up 'cause my diamonds be boxing (Woah)
Rich Forever getting to the cheddar now (Cheddar now)
I bought me a Maybach to ride around (Huh?)
I'm flexing, they pulling the cameras out (Flex)
They asking me, "What's all the talk about?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Left wrist froze, got pointers (Ice)
The bankroll too big, it don't fold up (Woah)
Rich Forever, whole gang froze up (Froze up)
She a motherfuckin' liar if she don't know us (Huh?)
Back to the trap (Trap)
VV's, bitch, my diamonds attack (Bitch)
Just sippin' the Act' (Act')
Ridin' 'round with a pint and a MAC (Grrah)
I spend it all, get it right back (Right back)
You niggas acting up, niggas showing off
Niggas not even like that (Niggas not even like that)
Gotta go run to the money,
I pick up a bag and I'm coming right back (Yeah, Yeah)
Them niggas lookin' real funny
I'm whippin' the Jag, I know they don't like that (Skrrt)
Diamonds they dancin' like Mike Jack

Runnin' to the bands, gotta cool off
Huh? We ain't into the ho talk
Turn a nigga whole afro to a mohawk, ayy
And I'm making mad money, no lie
In the big body, but it's fast like the go-kart, ayy
They be so mad when I pull up
Put your girlfriend in the back of the tour bus, ayy
I ain't got time for a ho now
Put my dick in her tonsil, make her throw up, ayy
The way she be rockin' Herm√®s
The way she rockin' all this Gucci and Louis
I wanna rock out her bed
I hope that pussy ain't loose and it's gooey
Let's take a flight to Berlin
I get you Givenchy and Jimmy Choo things
I skeeted all on her chest
Watch it drip all the way down to the pussy
I spend it all, get it right back (Right back)
You niggas acting up, niggas showing off
Niggas not even like that (Niggas not even like that)
Gotta go run to the money,
I pick up a bag and I'm coming right back (Bitch)
Them niggas lookin' real funny
I'm whippin' the Jag,
I know they don't like that (Skrrt, Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
