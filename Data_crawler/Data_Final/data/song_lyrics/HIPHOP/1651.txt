Song Name: Look @ This
(Infinity)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist (su)
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurances, no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big old stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it kick, kick, kick
Now they forfeitin' (it kick)
Red eye coupe, no Terminator, do top-view turns in that
Too many bitches, I got three on the neck (two), two on the wrist (two), two on the wrist (two)
Two on the neck, 'bout three on the wrist (literally)
The money keep comin', the tires keep runnin', don't know what to do with this shit (no)
The cars and clothes and hoes, no, you know we ain't new to this shit (you know that)
We givin' out tags for toes for niggas that troll and look like a lick (lick)
Poppin' out, I'm out in Paris fashion week, you see the pics (flash)
Medallions big as the fabrics, askin' me "How much is this?" (wow)
No matter the problem or the occasion, know that we takin' the risk (go)
Some niggas would rather be famous, but you see, me, I was made for this (Takeoff, ooh)
Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist (su)
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurances, no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big old stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it kick, kick, kick
Now they forfeitin' (it kick)
Red eye coupe, no Terminator, do top-view turns in that
Too many bitches, I got three on the neck (two), two on the wrist (two), two on the wrist (two)
(True)
If I go through the lane, I'm dunkin', I don't do lay ups, yeah (no-no)
I don't spill the drip for free, young nigga gotta pay up, yeah (uh)
The gang on a spendin' spree like lil' Trayle, yeah (spree)
How much your drip cost? (Woo), three on the neck, two on the wrist (200)
I even told Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder to look at this (Ray Charles)
Mama Takeoff gave me a Perky, swear I felt it kick (mama)
Dropped a bag of presidents, I came from bowls of grits (go)
Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist (su)
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurances, no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big old stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it kick, kick, kick
Now they forfeitin' (it kick)
Red eye coupe, no Terminator, do top-view turns in that
Too many bitches, I got three on the neck (two), two on the wrist (two), two on the wrist (two)
