Song Name: Wheelie (feat. 21 Savage)
(Check in with me, in with me)
Latto
Cole (Latto), you stupid
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (Latto)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (on God)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (skrrt)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (mhm)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Slob on my cat, bet this nigga met his match (yeah)
Take his phone 'fore I throw it back, nigga, this ain't that (fuck)
Check in with me (yeah), I love a sneaky link
He ain't eat the pussy right if he ain't had to change the sheets (woo)
I love when he wear the grey sweats and that print show (I do)
Nah, I ain't tryna have your seed, but this pussy water make the beard grow (woo)
Cook for him like a housewife then fuck him good like a nympho
Pay the rent and the car note, he invest in me like crypto
Tell me just how much you need me (yeah), paint the walls like I'm graffiti (yeah)
Birkin bag me, double C me (ooh)
He ain't trickin', go Houdini (whew), poof
Legs to the roof (skrrt), hit it in the coupe (ooh)
Slurp me like I'm soup
Pussy pink, hunnids blue
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (Latto)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (on God)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (skrrt)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (mhm)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (21) (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Bad bitches, I got several (21)
She eat the dick like it's edible (on God)
Slob on my knob, fuck that, lick on me, bitch, like an animal (straight up)
I want some top when I get done slidin'
Opps wanna rap but they ass keep dyin'
She don't wanna fuck, I ain't finna keep tryin'
Sayin' it's the time of the month, but she lyin'
Call my jeweler like, "I wanna go blind"
Thirty some' watches, I ain't never on time
Spin it again, now they ass back cryin'
Givin' out bullets like a motherfuckin' drive (21)
If you fake a relationship, you stealin' pussy (on God)
Make a e-mail for your ass, girl, I wanna book it (21)
I want the milk and cookies (21)
Drop off a Birkin, I'm Santa (21)
She let me hit it on camera (21)
So did her friend, it's a scandal (21)
She got a BBL (21)
Her hips and her ass a lil' fatter (on God)
The nigga who paid was a scammer (on God)
I heard they got married in Africa (on God)
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (Latto)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (on God)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Pop it like a wheelie
Hop on top and I go silly (skrrt)
Pretty, tight, and sticky
Fuck him once, he won't forget me (mhm)
Wet, wet, bust it like the blicky (grrrt)
If I fuck around and leak the tape, I win a Emmy (on God)
Slob on my cat, on my cat
'Cause you, 'cause you know it's fat
Know it's fat
