Song Name: Take Kare (feat. Lil Baby & Lil Durk)
I really, really, really need you
I really, really, really need you (shoutout to YodaYae)
I really, really, really need you, baby, so come over
In a foreign car (swerving), going so fast (oh-oh)
And I'm so high (high, yeah), probably won't last (oh, yeah)
If she fucks with you (yeah), she gon' ride for you (ride-ide for me)
If she fucks with you (yeah), she gon' die for you (die-ie for me)
Girl, I fuck with you, do you fuck with me? (Ride-ide for me)
Baby, love me, take care of me
All of my niggas, still all of my niggas, they never gon' change (change)
Diamonds on my neck, that's wet, ooh, shawty wanna have sex (sex)
I don't wanna have sex (nah), I just want a Rolex (wow, ooh)
Baby, baby, silky wet (wow) ooh, I might go get a check (wow), ooh
I believe in you to be there whenever I need you
Can't always be honest, but I will never mislead you
I work overtime for these dollars, I'm tryna feed you
I just dropped a dime on these glasses for me to see you
I never drop a dime on a nigga, that ain't my speed, bro'
How the fuck I'm in Miami on a speedboat?
All these pretty women boosting up my ego
Tell her, "I'ma be here forever," but then I leave though
How these nigga's follow the leader, and I'm in the lead, though?
You could've been quiet and silent, what you agree for?
You 'posed to be having your money, but now you need me
I ain't ever turn my back on a real one
Sipping all this purple, I'm hoping it'll make me feel better
I don't want no problem with bitches, so I don't deal with them
He done got away for the moment, but we gon' still get him
They ain't never taking it from me 'cause I'm a real nigga
In a foreign car, going so fast
And I'm so high (no one else), probably won't last
If she fucks with you (I can tell by the way), she gon' ride for you
If she fucks with you (carry yourself), she gon' die for you
Girl, I fuck with you, do you fuck with me? (Yeah)
Baby, love me (do you love me?) Take care of me
Girl, I fuck with you, do you fuck with me?
Baby, love me (no one else) take care of me
I just keep it real with you, bad terms, pull up, and I still hit you
She suck it out every time and it still tickle
I got a bitch that'll take a charge, do it big with you
I come from shit, I'm just tryna do it big with you
Drink lean, take honey, hit the crib with you
I want it all, plus I want another kid with you
I'm the voice, you can tell me what you been through
I don't really want my bitch to take Percocets
I treat her just like my mama, she ain't heard me yet
I told her, "30 million cash", she ain't 30 yet
See me drinking out a Sprite, it ain't dirty yet
She mad at me, play fight, throw a jab at me
I grab her neck 'cause I lick, she grab my dick, and she laugh at me
Nutted once and went to sleep, she call me "grand daddy", oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm embarrassed for my past, I won't go back
I don't bring up rumors, I bring big facts
I got a Chanel bag, it cost a knick-knack
And I ain't overly stressed, we gon' get back
She was on my back 'bout cheating
But she the one cheated, I ain't get that
Telling your friends I'm a liar
You said, "The shoe fit," but I ain't fit that
Mmm, we be sharing locations, mmm
She know my moves, probation, mmm
Putting me in my feelings, I face it, mmm, mmm
Oh-oh-oh, mmm, street nigga, I call her my baby, mmm
We made it through the rumors, we made it, mmm
Real love, true love, ain't fake, mmm, I get a hoe naked, ooh, ooh
In a foreign car, going so fast
And I'm so high (no one else), probably won't last
If she fucks with you (I can tell by the way), she gon' ride for you
If she fucks with you (carry yourself), she gon' die for you
Girl, I fuck with you, do you fuck with me? (Yeah)
Baby, love me (do you love me?) Take care of me
Girl, I fuck with you, do you fuck with me?
Baby, love me (no one else), take care of me
Need you, really, really, wanna see you
I need, I need you right now
I really, really, need you right now
Someone else, ooh
I can tell by the way, carry yourself
