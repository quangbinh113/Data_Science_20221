Song Name: Hell Yeah
Blue strips, the blue cash, yeah, yeah (blue cash)
All blue strips, the blue bag, yeah, yeah (blue, blue)
Shorty wanna bring her friend to tag, yeah, yeah (oh, tag)
Bring an overnight bag just to stay, hell yeah
Screamin' like a white boy, I'm wasted, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Pop a pill, don't taste it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Stone cold ice faces, hell yeah (hell yeah)
I told the world I was gon' make it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Now I made it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
I create it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
That's why I chase it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
I put the diamonds on, no fu' shit, no rhinestone (ice)
I put the M's up, they say this shit don't last long (M's)
The whole family, I put 'em on, no tagalong (fam')
I cannot give up, I gotta bring that bag home (racks)
I bought a condo, 'cause back in the day, I didn't have those (no)
Stayed in the bando, I trapped it out the bando (bando)
More chicken than Nando's, I pluck the strings like banjo (banjo)
I had a billfold just to make the racks close (racks close)
I bet the racks won't fold, now it's overload (fold)
I am inspirin' to the soul, make the soul glow (glow)
Blue strips, the blue cash, yeah, yeah (blue cash)
All blue strips, the blue bag, yeah, yeah (blue, blue)
Shorty wanna bring her friend to tag, yeah, yeah (oh, tag)
Bring an overnight bag just to stay, hell yeah
Screamin' like a white boy, I'm wasted, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Pop a pill, don't taste it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Stone cold ice faces, hell yeah (hell yeah)
I told the world I was gon' make it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Now I made it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
I create it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
That's why I chase it, yeah, yeah (Takeoff)
I'm the chosen one, but, no, I wasn't mistaken (nah)
Presidential coupe, it's a Wraith, Ronald Reagan (Wraithy)
As-salamu alaykum, all my brothers fightin' cases
How the money full of races, but the world still racist? (How?)
Runnin' the money, like the liquor, gotta chase it (chase it)
First you gotta breathe, practice humble, then it's patience (breathe)
I hit the pot, the Forgiatos slidin' with Mercedes (slide)
At six o'clock, she smelled the Baccarat, she knew the fragrance (huh?)
Don't talk, the money speak, I'm on the mind of your lady (mind)
We made it, never hated, underrated, group the greatest
Conversation turn to confrontation, meaning complications
Need a job, I do a favor, huh, well, here's your application (here)
Put the pressure on 'em for the cup of tea, interrogation (pressure)
The stretcher on the white, still sellin' Sarah Palin (stretch it)
Lot of blues in my pocket, that's a blue face, baby (hell yeah)
Make a move for my pocket, that'd be doomsday, baby (hell yeah)
I can still intercept or steal, Champ Bailey (steal)
Pop a seal, I'ma drink codeine on the daily (still sealed)
It was bad, sent the bad bitch to bait 'em (shit was bad)
Shit get sad when his own partners snake him (snake)
Blue strips, the blue cash, yeah, yeah (blue cash)
All blue strips, the blue bag, yeah, yeah (blue, blue)
Shorty wanna bring her friend to tag, yeah, yeah (oh, tag)
Bring an overnight bag just to stay, hell yeah
Screamin' like a white boy, I'm wasted, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Pop a pill, don't taste it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Stone cold ice faces, hell yeah (hell yeah)
I told the world I was gon' make it, hell yeah (hell yeah)
Now I made it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
I create it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
That's why I chase it, yeah, yeah (yeah)
