Song Name: Hotel (feat. R. Kelly)
Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening to the sounds of Swizz Beatz
We got Cassidy in here, Kels!
We in our throwbacks
Uh, this is for the ladies, we got room keys
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cause we're having an after party, checkin' out six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin', six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
Checkin' out six in the mornin' (six in the mornin', six in the mornin', mornin')
I be staying in the ho-tel, not the mo-tel or the Holiday Inn (say what?)
If that girl don't participate, well then I'ma take her friend (say what?)
But if, mami is with it then, mami can get it if
Mami a rider, I'ma slide up inside her
I got a suite, you can creep on through
I know you tryin' to get your freak on too
I do it all for the (ladies), yeah, I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies), keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on the (ladies), hot tub for my (ladies)
Pop bub for the (ladies), I got love for my (ladies)
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cause we're having an after party, checkin' out six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin', six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
Checkin' out six in the mornin' (six in the mornin', six in the mornin', mornin')
We're the new car-tel, R-Kell and the kid Cassidy (say what?)
Girl, if your man start actin' up, ask for him or ask for me (say what?)
'Cause see, we could go get it crackin', but you know what'll happen
We be under the covers, makin' love to each other
I got a double bed, one's to sleep on, other one's to get my freak on
It's all for the (ladies), yeah, I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies), keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on the (ladies), hot tub for my (ladies)
Pop bub for the (ladies), I got love for my (ladies)
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cause we're having an after party, checkin' out six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin', six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
Checkin' out six in the mornin' (six in the mornin', six in the mornin', mornin')
We goin' Chi-Town step it out, to the club lettin' out
Then we gon' sex it out, 'til we all checkin' out
I got my chicks I'ma bring to the telly
We 'bout to do the damn thing sing to 'em Kelly
It's alright (it's alright)
If you wanna come with me
And fulfil your fantasy, baby, in my hotel suite
And it's okay (it's okay)
If you wanna party night 'til day
I will do anything you say
Just come to my hotel
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cause we're having an after party, checkin' out six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin', six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
Checkin' out six in the mornin' (six in the mornin', six in the mornin', mornin')
