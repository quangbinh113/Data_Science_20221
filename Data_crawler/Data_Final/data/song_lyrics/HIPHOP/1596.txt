Song Name: The Way
I was lookin' at you and you was lookin' at me and we was thinkin'
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
My lips, my starin' here
Oh, oh
Girl, you different, you actin' real distant
All this lovin' for nothing
I'm over here missin', we can't keep goin'
I thought that you knew, so lost without you
And you're the reason, said you're the reason
That I'm in love, I'm love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
Shawty, you the whole reason, yeah
We lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We found a way, found a way (Found a way)
Found a way, hey
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way (Way, yeah)
As we lay here, here
I think how we got down there
But it's hard to accept that you different (That you're different)
Than all the other women (All the other women)
Come on, come on, come on
We got baggage, we should spend some time unpackin' it
'Cause we still feel far away, couldn't imagine it
This ain't gonna work, this race to who says "Fuck you" first
Thank God I found your love
I'm in love, the reason I'm in love
I'm in love, the reason I'm in love
I'm in love, the reason I'm in love
Shawty, you the whole reason, yeah
We lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We found a way, found a way (Found a way)
Found a way, hey
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
Baby, my lips are staring here
Oh (Found a way), oh
Hey (Oh, found a way)
Baby, my lips are staring here
Oh
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
That I'm in love, I'm in love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
The reason I'm in love, I'm in love
Shawty, you the whole reason, yeah
We lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way (Found a way)
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We found a way, found a way (Found a way)
Found a way, hey
We found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
We was lost, but bae, we found a way
