Song Name: Hard to Tell
I'm scrolling through messages while being negligent
To something relevant it's pretty evident
It don't take precedence if it questioning life
Relieving the pressure of people impatient
If it was rotating I'd probably be waiting
Cos' my expectations are deeply related to pride
My loyalty strong and my honor's adjacent
It's not about paper the form of the payment
I use is the labor of love hasn't a price
Depreciated by those who have taken what can't be replaced
Is the needle that's breaking the back of the camel
We see irritating its eye
Oh I don't feel a way about nothing
We made it hard to tell
Oh I don't feel a way about nothing
We make it hard to tell
I'm done being nice, to people who thieve in the night
You be in my light teeming with spite from seeing me bright
If we only tight cause I make all the effort you getting severed
It's only right
That I connect in the flesh with my brethren not with a like
It is what it is, the way that I was not fit for the biz
Now nothing gets under my skin
And I can not get cut cause I'm needed to win
Even a brother can become a memory time will eventually lead to drift
Making an enemy out of somebody
What was the reason we seem to forget
I needed to split not only from people
But also an ego
I started to trip into an abyss the ultimate evil
And that's when you're quick to think
Everybody is trying to defeat you
I learned to let slip doesn't assist and now I live peaceful
Oh I don't feel a way about nothing
We made it hard to tell
Oh I don't feel a way about nothing
We make it hard to tell
