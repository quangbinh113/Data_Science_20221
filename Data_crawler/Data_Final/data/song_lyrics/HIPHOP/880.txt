Please don't make me spend them bands on you (yeah)
That .40 on our waist and we ready to shoot
Hundred-round on the Draco and a 50-round on the carbon
.22 clip in the Kel-Tec, f- bygones or pardons
Got a snubnose and a shotty (shotty), n- move wrong, get bodied (bodied)
17 shots in the Glock 17, aim right where your heart is (heart is)
400 hollows in the HK, get a n- whacked (get a n- whacked)
Draco spit .223's, how did it f- around and cause a earthquake?
Heard his organs spilled, n- hit him up in the worst way (worst way)
I crashed quicker than my second week
Out of jail in the white Merce's (Merce's)
Uh, spin the block with a Glock, do you spin again?
Shoot the b-, set 'em off, we ain't settin' trends
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps (oh yeah)
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps (oh yeah)
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps (oh yeah)
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps (yeah)
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks (yeah)
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks
Whole lot of money, got a whole lot of that (yeah)
Woke up in a whole 'nother bag (which one?)
Neck cost a dog food slab (whole crib)
Don't do beef on the net (nah)
I don't talk bags on the jack (nah)
Get home with the racks and add to the stash
12-dollar kush, pull up to the trap
Is the club computer-friendly? (Why?)
Bro tryna get in with the MAC (grrra)
We gon' stack, stack, stack, n- (stack, stack, stack, stack)
We could go rack for rack for rack, n- (rack for rack for rack for rack)
We don't make rap-cap hits (no)
Bro really gon' splat your s- (fye-fye)
Real hundreds, no catfish, b- (no catfish)
Big bags got the trap lit, b- (got the trap lit)
Starin' at the sky (starin' at the sky), not the clouds, the watch (skydweller)
Talk loud, get dropped (there he go)
Baow-baow, goodbye (he out of here)
Skelly made by Audemars (Audemars)
Bust down keep me out of the dark (out the dark)
My n- look just like humans (like humans)
Don't be fooled, we sharks (baow)
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps
Stack a lot of facts, tote a whole lot of straps
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks
Whole lot of bags, got a whole lot of racks
Whole lot of money, got a whole lot of that, uh
He gon' make me spend them bands on you
They gon' make me spend them bands on them
Please don't make me spend them bands on you
That .40 on our waist and we ready to shoot
