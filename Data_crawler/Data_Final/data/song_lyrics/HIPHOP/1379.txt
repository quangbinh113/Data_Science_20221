See this how I'm living (how you living?)
The pain in my eyes start hurting the struggle
Since I lost my brother yeah, now the family wanna huddle
But I can't say fuck 'em, no
We thick and we strong, we sown like a mustard
In the world yeah, we got each other
Only thing in the world I want is my brother
They ask me I'm okay
Fuck no, I ain't okay, seen my twin brother die in my face
Got a lot on my plate, never thought it be this way
Never question God 'til this day
Lord, why you had to take?
Why you had to take my brother?
I remember them nights we was thuggin'
Just me and my brother robbin' 'cause we ain't have nothin'
Know we had to get some money
'Member robbin' niggas for they tool
Brother ask me, "What you wanna do?"
I said, "Fuck it, I'ma ride with you"
We watchin' niggas, we gon' play it cool
Spot 'em, got 'em, man I get on his ass
Me and my brother, yeah we thicker than glass
I miss my nigga yeah, I 'member them last

Who I'm gon' call when it's time to ride?
Who gon' pull up when it's time to slide, ay
Me and my brother, we stick together, no other
We blowing up like a bubble
And we took over no other, yeah
Who I'm gon' call when it's time to ride?
Who gon' pull up when it's time to slide, yeah?
Me and my brother, we stick together, no other
We blowing up like a bubble
And we took over no other, yeah
See who I'm gon' call, I swear I can't grieve from afar
But it's fucked up that I can't see, yeah
Yeah, I just got it all, I swear I wanna give you my all
But damn lil' bruh, I can't believe it
See it might sound petty, we was two eyes, no Fetty
Ay, ay, with no Eddie
See you was my nigga, used to do eveything with you
Hard head, never listen
Lost my brother, yeah this shit is so crazy
Mama never thought she bury her baby
Since he died, shit ain't been the same lately
Heart aching and it feeling so painful
Mama said, "Son, keep yo' head up"
Know the waves but I'm getting fed up
Foot on niggas and I'm not lettin' up
Watch on 5ive, bitch I miss my brother
Who was gon' slide, yeah it's gon' be you
Who was gon' ride, yeah it's gon' be you
Who was gon' slide, yeah it's gon' be you
Pull with the 5ive, yeah you know he gon' shoot
And that was my brother, yeah
