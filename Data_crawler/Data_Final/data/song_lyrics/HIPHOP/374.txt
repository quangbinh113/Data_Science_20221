Song Name: Lil Boat
D-D-Daytrip took it to 10
Hey, ayy I feel like Lil Boat with the ice
I want Ferragamo, I want ice
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, supersize
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, super- (Yee)
Yeah, first I fuck the bih, uh, then I parked my car, yeah
Even with the clouds, we still laying under stars, yeah
Ain't used to being home, ain't seen my bedroom in a while (No)
Rather be out on the road making figures, ask me how (Yeah)
All the years I scraped the plate, can't afford to fuck around
All the losses took to date, I deserve the bust down
Money piling show to show, getting hard for me to count, yeah
I pulled up with my slime, 666, that be the town, yeah
Catch me in the field, Sammy Sosa in his prime
Gucci print on my shirt, it look different, hard to find
Walking up from the Saks with the fifth, I blow they mind
If it ever go to trial, already know I'll beat the time (Yeah)
Momma said I'd be great, take your blessings as a sign
Vacay to Amalfi Coast, smoking Cubans, sipping fine
And that's XO on my chain, 40 pointers on my link
Last year this shit was different, used to go out, count my drinks
Ayy, I feel like Lil Boat with the ice
I want Ferragamo, I want ice
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, supersize (Supersize)
New Patek alright, yeah, alright (Yeah, alright)
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, super
Diamonds in your face like Stevie, yeah, I make 'em go blind
(Make me go blind)
Came from outer space like ET, yeah, I'm 'bout to go live (Yee)
It's good for her stomach like green tea, yeah, so I hit from behind
(So I hit from behind)
Upgrade from SI to the VV, yeah, it only takes time
All of my bubble gum dreams, we gon' see in real life
Baby girl suck me to sleep, but I ain't laid no pipe (Yeah-ah)
Fuckin' that bitch 'til she get scoliosis, she say I show no emotion
(Yeah-ah)
Line up the horse in the stable, I park the Porsche in the stable, ayy
Streets, best be back before dark
Streets, where a rat is a shark
I can't move grams all the time
(I-I can't move grams all the time)
Ayy, I feel like Lil Boat with the ice
I want Ferragamo, I want ice (Yeah)
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, supersize (Supersize)
New Patek alright, yeah, alright (Yeah, alright)
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, super
