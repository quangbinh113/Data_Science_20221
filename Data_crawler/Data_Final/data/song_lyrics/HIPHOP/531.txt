Song Name: 10 Feet
You make feel, yeah
Uh, I don't wanna try, but
So primal, and (Woah)
That's what I am (Woah)
I'm just a man, yeah, yeah
You make feel, yeah
So primal, and (Woah)
That's what I am (Woah)
I'm just a man, yeah, yeah
Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
Can't disappear and re-appear
In the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the Perc packer
The mom thrasher
The Perc mixed with the syrup
Turn me into a contractor
A straight tweak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak
(You make me feel)
Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little Heaven up in my Hell
Yeah, I know it never ever end well
Yeah, I know I always fall victim to a rich spell
Uh, like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab Magnums
Been raw-doggin' bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like Hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if it's room in Heaven for savages
My life's a canvas
I'm paintin' in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it, huh
A little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
Of someone who don't got shit
But the clothes on they back
And its been that way since way back since
(You make me feel)
Like I'm a killer or somethin'
These niggas lip-singin' like
Milli Vanilli or somethin'
I'm like Lil' Wayne I got a milli-milli-milli or somethin'
I guess, I'm rich, in broke pockets
Bountiful, my soul's empty, so deep, ten feet
(You make me feel)
Times ten feet
(So primal, and, woah)
Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me
That you with me (That's what I am)
And not against me
Where I'm from we loaded up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do

Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
