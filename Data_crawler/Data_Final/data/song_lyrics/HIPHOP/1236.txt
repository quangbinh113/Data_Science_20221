Song Name: Ash Kaashh
I got three thots on my dick
Buss down Gucci, all on my fit
Ice on my wrist
Rolex that's drip
She like Ash Kaashh, only the tip
I be skirting off in that whip
I see an opp, and that boy get hit
Your girl on top when I drop that guap
I feel like I'm Carti, I'ma die lit
I got three thots on my dick
Buss down Gucci, all on my fit
Ice on my wrist
Rolex that's drip
She like Ash Kaashh, only the tip
I be skirting off in that whip
I see an opp, and that boy get hit
Your girl on top when I drop that guap
I feel like I'm Carti, I'ma die lit
Like what the fuck is up
I don't wanna be your love
I be gettin' to these bands
And I started out the mud
Lil' bitch on my line
And you know she gettin' dubbed, ay
I don't want no old money, only new cheddar
Lil' bitch on my dick 'cause she cannot do better
She got a fat ass, and she gotta beretta
You talk to me tough, but you soft as a feather
Pull with the four, five, yeah, I got the strap
I've been getting to the bag, now your girl she want my snap
I'on even like these thots, but it's funny how they act
Every time I make a song like Chris Smoove, I always splash
They don't wanna see me up, so I had to prove 'em wrong
Me and Nathan making hits, all the e-girls sing our songs
We just hit another lick, and we 'bout to get hella rich
See me posted with your chick, going ape like king kong
I got three thots on my dick
Buss down Gucci, all on my fit
Ice on my wrist
Rolex that's drip
She like Ash Kaashh, only the tip
I be skirting off in that whip
I see an opp, and that boy get hit
Your girl on top when I drop that guap
I feel like I'm Carti, I'ma die lit
I got three thots on my dick
Buss down Gucci, all on my fit
Ice on my wrist
Rolex that's drip
She like Ash Kaashh, only the tip
I be skirting off in that whip
I see an opp, and that boy get hit
Your girl on top when I drop that guap
I feel like I'm Carti, I'ma die lit
