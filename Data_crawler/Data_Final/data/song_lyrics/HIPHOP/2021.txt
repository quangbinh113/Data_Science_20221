Song Name: Nail Tech
Mmm-mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm
Tuh
My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweaking
I look like I been getting money, how I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walking 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix, and I'm handshaking, but most of y'all can't help it (nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all giving off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro' test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city hauling, and I'm co-signing this wave, coming up next out it
Riding 'round and shotgun in her Tesla
Hanging both of my legs out of it, like, "What's up?"
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out, and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearing this shit, like, "What the fuck?"
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over gram, that's my MO (on my mama!)
Fuck a "close friends", I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload
Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book bag up
And my chain hitting like baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit
And I touch down, they bow, bow, bow, bow
She down low, three point stance
I'm back there doing Jack Dan's like baow, baow, baow, baow

And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though
And I know I gave up drinking, but I'm high though
I told her, "I don't come from here, but you can try though"
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp, and it's just, uh (ooh)
Wide open, big whipping, it slide open (mmm-mmm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps going how I wrote it, how the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then, it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?
It's very few of you I like, but it's a whole lot of y'all I don't trust
'Cause...
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over gram, that's my MO
Fuck a "close friends", I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload
Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book bag up
And my chain hitting like baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit
And I touch down, they bow, bow, bow, bow
She down low, three point stance
I'm back there doing Jack Dan's like baow, baow, baow, baow
