Uh
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil
It left so many, R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh
Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Yeah
Bright lights pass me in the city, it's emergency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my 30's, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but movin' like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel the way that you would follow me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
And it left so many, R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh, yeah
Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Yeah
Too much money to count, what's the amount?
Check never bounce
I gotta pay a nigga to add it up
Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say, he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin' up, stackin' up
You're reachin', I'm actin' up
Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Makin' five a month, that's regular
Nigga playin' with us, that's a negative
Go back to the start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas don't slipped, let me get ahead of 'em
Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past
I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas
This not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me
Just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit startin' to make sense
I'm stayin' hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's startin' to get annoyin'
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money comin' in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
And it left so many, R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
