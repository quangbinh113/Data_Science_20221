Song Name: Errbody
Firin' at everybody
Firin' at everybody
Section 8 just straight cooked this muhfucker up
Firin' at everybody
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter in the middle of the hood
I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin'
I swear I don't care about it
Boy, you play, you don' die in front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught a L but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
I used to pray for a plug who gon' go out the way
And come back with a lot of them bitches
I used to dream about condos when we leavin' Lenox
Now I stay on top of them bitches
I won't give a damn if he ran him up a whole billion
I still won't acknowledge them niggas
He put my name in a song, what the fuck is he on?
I don't care, boy, we gotta go get 'em
House big as fuck in the middle of nowhere
I dick her down, I don't care what my hoe wear
I made Lil Cam spend a block on a four-wheel
Nah, for real, spend the block on the four-wheel
Five million dollars, for me, that ain't no deal
I done made that times six in like three years
Off this rap shit, I can't even talk about the trap shit
I just hope they can take it, I keep me a Stallion like Megan
A residency out in Vegas
Might fly to L.A. and go fuck with LeBron and the Lakers
Come back to Atlanta with Jayda
Bruh told us to take care of the neighbors and stack all the paper
Whatever we want, buy it later
I know how to shit on a hater and handle the business
Whatever God give me, I'm grateful
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter in the middle of the hood
I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin'
I swear I don't care about it
Boy, you play, you don' die in front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught a L but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
Cartier watches for everyone 'round me
I ran it up, how the fuck could you down me?
She set for life, how the fuck is you clownin'?
Bought all this water, ain't never gon' drown
I'm in the 'Yo, I'm perfectin' my sound
I helped them out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend
I done geeked up the motor
My brother in prison in Polo
I jumped in the game and went loco
I put on these clothes like a hobo
That's layers of drip, I showed my ass in Phipps
You play, ya mans get killed, said that before but I'm dead for real
Lil' bro jumpin' 'round like his legs done healed
I ran it up off a vacuum sealed
If I fall off today I'm a legend still
Bruh showed me the way, I ain't never steal
This Glock ain't no prop, it'll pop for real
I fuck with the syrup, I don't pop no pills
My young niggas turnt, they don't got no deals
I need me a billion so I can chill
I'm drivin' like I ain't got no license still
My Trackhawk move like it got nitrogen, I'm poppin' seals
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter in the middle of the hood
I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin'
I swear I don't care about it
Boy, you play, you don' die in front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught a L but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
I paid attention and found out the recipe
I take a seat and they still won't get 'head of me
I'm on my shit, now a bitch can't get next to me
You ain't got a hundred thousand, you can't have sex with me
Ain't showed the best of me yet
And ain't in nobody debt, I'm sum' like a vet'
I bought my big brother a 'Vette
My numbers so good, my label prolly owe me a check
They play with Lil Baby, I swear it gon' go down
Biggest lil' nigga that's over at Motown
Jumped off the porch and went straight, kicked the door down
Flipped the clip, switch the clip, it's some more rounds
Rappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round
I took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces
Ask around, we them guys, come we do no clownin'
If I can I'm gon' try keep the smoke down
Once it's up then it's stuck, it ain't go down
Like to switch where I sleep, I got four houses
Every time the heat come, I make four thousand
Big done gave me the game and I ran with it
Milk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it
Could've been, hit yo' bitch, I be sparin' niggas
Make me mad, I'm gon' call up them grave diggers
Bought my mom a new crib and it's way bigger
Never been to it once, that's a great feelin'
I'ma go there when I get a chance
I lost five hunnid racks before I signed a deal
Swear to God, still got my advance
Yeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up
Yeah, I hit, but she ain't get a follow-up
Ain't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women
I promise they swallow us all
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter in the middle of the hood
I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin'
I swear I don't care about it
Boy, you play, you don' die in front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught a L but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
