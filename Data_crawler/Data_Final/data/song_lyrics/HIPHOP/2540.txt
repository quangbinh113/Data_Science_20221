Song Name: Neighborhood Hero (feat. No Cap)
Here for you
I am always here
Always here for you
I am always here
I hear demons in my sleep on my soul
Ohh
Gunna, gunna
Gunna, gunna
Neighborhood hero
Neighborhood preacher
We was in the trenches movin' keys, no Alicia
I be paintin' pictures wit' my bars, Mona Lisa
Glock came wit' a thirty and a beam, that's a threesome
Glock came wit' a thirty and a beam that's a homicide
Make yo' mama shed a tear before you make my mama cry
Speak on Stunna G, his ass go on Channel 5
All three of yo' brothers die
Crazy, they ain't even slide
Alhamdulillah, pray for me
I need you right here, baby
I got PTSD, I ain't crazy
I hеar demons in my sleep on my soul
Uh, grew up in the trеnches wit' some demons, I ain't have a heart
Walks up wit' no mask on the opps 'cause we ain't have no car
I was only 14 when I let off that Beretta spark
Now my diamonds dancin', uh
Oh, you think you fancy, huh?
Went from holly hood to Hollywood, but it ain't change me
Don't ask me what I bang, 'cause I might up that-, uh, and flame you
They ain't know lil' Stunna tote that-, uh, bitch, I'm dangerous
She love the way I twisted my fingers, lil' bitch I'm sanctioned
Neighborhood prophet, uh
You eat and you got your lil' money you think you poppin', uh
Way before pandemic I had knots all in my pocket, uh
VDK I ride my city, we the hottest topic, uh
Neighborhood hero
Neighborhood preacher
We was in the trenches movin' keys, no Alicia
I be paintin' pictures wit' my bars, Mona Lisa
Glock came wit' a thirty and a beam, that's a threesome
Glock came wit' a thirty and a beam that's a homicide
Make yo' mama shed a tear before you make my mama cry
Speak on Stunna G, his ass go on Channel 5
All three of yo' brothers die
Crazy, they ain't even slide
Pussy
Pray for me
I need you right here, baby
I got PTSD, I ain't crazy
I hear demons in my sleep on my soul
Pray for me
Alhamdulillah, pray for me
I got PTSD, I ain't crazy
