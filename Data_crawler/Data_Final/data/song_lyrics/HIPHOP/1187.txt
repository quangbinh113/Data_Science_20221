Song Name: Go Hard
I go hard, hard (go, go)
I go hard (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Bae, for you, I go hard, hard (ayy, KBeaZy, you fye'd up)
Just don't break my heart, heart (just don't break my heart, heart)
I been on the drugs hard, hard (I been on the drugs hard, hard)
Smokin' on dope like a rasta (smokin' on dope like a rasta)
Try to take you from me, that choppa go grrah, grrah (take you from me, that choppa go grrah, grrah)
It go grrah, grrah (it go grrah, grrah)
Try to take you from me, it go grrah, grrah, go, go (take you from me, it go grrah, grrah)
It go grrah, grrah, go, go, go
I was sittin' in the crib with a hand full of racks and a heart full of pain, yeah
Funny thing is, I really did think all hoes were the same
Then I saw your face and I heard your name, name
Had to make you my bae, put that on the gang, gang
The groupie hoes don't phase mе, tryna give out that lame brain
It don't amaze mе, your heart I contain, 'tain
Take her to safety, yeah
You're my getaway, so you can't get away (ayy)
For you, I go hard, hard (for you, I go hard, hard)
Just don't break my heart, heart (just don't break my heart, heart)
I been on the drugs hard, hard (I been on the drugs hard, hard)
Smokin' on dope like a rasta (smokin' on dope like a rasta)
Try to take you from me, that choppa go grrah, grrah (take you from me, that choppa go grrah, grrah)
It go grrah, grrah (it go grrah, grrah)
Try to take you from me, it go grrah, grrah (take you from me, it go grrah, grrah)
It go grrah, grrah, go, go, go
For you, I go hard
Just don't break my heart
I been on the drugs hard
Yeah, smokin' hard
