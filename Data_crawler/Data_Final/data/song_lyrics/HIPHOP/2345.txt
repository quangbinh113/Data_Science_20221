Song Name: Talk
Yeat concert, Yeat, Yeat (come on, man)
Man, this nigga on another world right now
They said, uh, niggas was gettin' tazed
Bitches was poppin' pussy by the front door
Niggas was throwin' chairs, everything was goin' down
Fifty-thousand people, Yeat concert, twizzy shit right here
Real twizzy shit right here (real twizzy shit right here)
You guys don't know 'bout it
Jump out at the show (uh, I'm working on dying), jump out at the show
Had to change my flow, yeah, had to change the job (BNYX)
'Bout to train my diamonds, yeah, they smackin' head to toe
"Shh" 'bout what you sayin', yeah, just shut up, let me go
Huh, riding in that big lil' ass Tonka truck
Riding 'round with these bust-down watches on me
I got my blicky tucked
Headin' number one up on these charts
Bitch, yeah, it's stuck as what?
A-a-all we do is just go number one, uh
And I just brought in some Ms, lil' bitch, it's the first of the month
Riding 'round, I'm in the Cayenne, lil' bitch
I'ma tear up the city, I'm afraid of the sun (hey, hey, hey)
I went and painted the Benz
I switched shit up, I wanted it done by the don
All of my fans is my family, my cult, my brother
My slime, my twizzy, my mom
I don't give a fuck what you sayin', I don't listen to it
I don't wanna hear 'bout nun
In the woods at 2:00 A.M. Rolls Royce truck
Yeah, with the Cullinan up
I'm 'bout to bring this shit back and away from the top
It the time of month
I'm 'bout to do it again, 'bout to do it again
'Bout to triple it or somethin'
How you gon' talk to a rat?
How you gon' talk to the feds?
How you gon' talk to the smats?
How you gon' talk to the lead?
I don't give a fuck, just sayin', huh
Lil' bit', you heard what I said
Yeah, I got big boy diamonds on me
Yeah, I got big boy bread
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the coupe
Yeah, I park the Benz on tens
You ain't even made no money
Yeah, he don't make no sense
I had to turn the coupe, I'm 'bout to trip out again
Jump out at the show (Uh, I'm working on dying), jump out at the show
Had to change my flow, yeah, had to change the job (BNYX)
'Bout to train my diamonds, yeah, they smackin' head to toe
"Shh" 'bout what you sayin', yeah, just shut up, let me go
