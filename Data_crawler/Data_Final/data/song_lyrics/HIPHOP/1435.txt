Song Name: Tootsies
(Sonic goin' crazy)
Blew a hundred last month at Tooties
If you got five hundred, then you better book me
Catch me in ATL with my YSL's, pushin' P
Stop talkin' that talk, bitch suck this dick
My Audemars Piguet make 'em wanna cut my wrist
I bet we fuck it up and tear the roof off this bitch
Three hundred thou', even my lil' coupe cost some shit
I want another house, I don't give a fuck who bought this bitch
Take some time, talk some shit, I ain't never lost a bitch
Seen a opp outside playin' defense and we caught a pick
When I'm sippin' on this Hi-Tech, my throat be raw as shit
Real rich nigga, I can tell you how them flawless diamonds hit
Real shooter, aim at yo' medulla, I'm a connoisseur
Got that mula, when I'm in the Chi', gotta call up Booka
If you listen, I can teach shit, gotta be quick
Lil' nigga think he litty, only got a street hit
I was hittin' Billboard charts before my son could walk and shit
Throwin' diamonds on him before my lil' nigga could talk and shit
I just spent a day at my location with a rich bitch
They said the Yompton niggas couldn't do it and now we killin' shit
Blew a hundred last month at Tooties
If you got five hundred, then you better book me
Catch me in ATL with my YSL's, pushin' P
Stop talkin' that talk, bitch suck this dick
My Audemars Piguet make 'em wanna cut my wrist
I bet we fuck it up and tear the roof off this bitch
Three hundred thou', even my lil' coupe cost some shit
I want another house, I don't give a fuck who bought this bitch
Buss downs, big blocks, bad hoes, mansions
You be speculatin', I know you niggas can't stand us
I can patty cake with all these niggas one handed
Global jet pass, I can't never get stranded
Make my niggas buss a shh on a shh shh
I'm quick to hear a bitch talkin' and tell her, "Shh shh"
We got assassins makin' deals goin' two for one
She talkin' like she want molly, I told her do one
You can catch Ricch out in traffic, in some fast shit
You told me that that bitch exclusive, but I bagged it
Said she like me 'cause I keep it humble, I ain't flashy
Said my lifestyle kind of bougie but it's ratchet
Blew a hundred last month at Tooties
If you got five hundred, then you better book me
Catch me in ATL with my YSL's, pushin' P
Stop talkin' that talk, bitch suck this dick
My Audemars Piguet make 'em wanna cut my wrist
I bet we fuck it up and tear the roof off this bitch
Three hundred thou', even my lil' coupe cost some shit
I want another house, I don't give a fuck who bought this bitch
