Song Name: Race My Mind
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancing, huh
I hit you like, "Please come home to me" (come home to me)
But you're not understanding, no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since that you're comin' home intoxicated, oh, yeah
Race, race my mind
I got the keys
Picture me rollin' through downtown in the A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no, "K, sure"
Soon as I tell you that you the one I will wait for
You too saucy, too flossy
You moved in then moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love gettin' T-d up, love showin' the cakes
You know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spellin' mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
(Them niggas just can't understand it)
I want you to change my mind, I'm prayin' you pullin' up
Know who you bein' 'round, I know that they teamin' up
Tellin' you you better off leavin' me in the dust
I wanted you to race my mind
I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind
Please, please, please
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
