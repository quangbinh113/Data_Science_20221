Song Name: Avalanche
Woo, papa was a rollin' stone
But now I got rollin' stones in the bezel (ice)
Mama at home all alone, hustlin', tryna keep this shit together (mama)
Young niggas smokin' on gas
I'm livin' too fast, my foot on the pedal (woo)
If I go back to the past
My niggas ain't know we'd be rockin' coachella (hey)
If a nigga ever try me or play me, I buy him an iced-out shovel (ice)
Dig ya own grave, nigga, you played yourself
I put some cash on your schedule (you played yourself)
If a bitch ever try to filet me, huh (yeah)
I just sit back and let her (she got it)
Think she come up off the 'Cho, it's whatever
My pockets came with extra cheddar (go)
I can see through the fuck shit (fuck shit)
I think that my skills gettin' better (gettin' better)
With a stick, come in peace, Mandela (Mandela)
I'm willin' to feed whoever (who?)
How can I help you? (How?)
Nobody judge you but God (God)
You can watch us beat the odds (beat it)
This is no cap, no facade
Young, rich, and black, and we gon' beat the charge (we gon')
I'm spendin' cash, no card
I'm likin' her natural ass, no fraud (yeah)
If she got a fake ass, of course
Girl, ain't nothin' wrong with enhancin', it's yours (she bad)
From the back, from the back, we enjoy it (soo)
Hunnid rack, I'ma attack with my boy (attack)
Got the clip, pokin' out, we be showin' (showin')
Anybody check clout, we be knowin' (clout)
In and out, in and out, we be goin' (go)
On a 757 Boeing (jet)
And my AP same size as The Forum (that's big)
Better get you some bread where you from (yeah)
I spend my mills on the crib (mansion)
Cover myself, F&N is my shit (cover)
I spent a dime, go run you a drill (dime)
If you do the time, come home to a mill' (time)
Double my seal (double), sign another deal (sign)
G6 pills (G), money gimme chills (chills)
I make the bitch hit her knees, she kneel (bitch)
I make the stick hit when I'm in the field (stick)
I made your bitch lick it up like, "Ew" (baow)
Spend a hunnid racks on the teeth, not a grill (racks)
Lookin' at your diamonds on your neck, ain't real (who?)
Nigga, you a bitch, let the Draco kill (bitch)
Heard what I said (heard)
Spinnin' your block every day 'til you're dead (spin, spin)
Live on the edge, codeine my meds (codeine)
Open your legs (legs), I fuck with my stick in the bed (rraow)
We shootin', not fightin' like Craig (bow)
Bad bitches, they DM, they still in my thread (D-DM)
They ain't never give us our cred' (cred')
Patek, rose gold with the face, ruby red (ruby)
Put a hole in your head, not your legs (hey)
Put my hands on her head, she a pet (ah)
M-I-G-O, nigga, that's the set (Migo)
Fuck that P-O, I'ma just pay it (who)
White glass in my Lambo', it look like it's albino
I hit your bitch, she say, "Ouch," hit a high note (ouch)
I'm Richie Rich like Lionel (Richie Rich)
Count your blessings, don't worry 'bout the rivals (hey)
Grandma told me, "Go read the Bible" (grandma)
Shoulda listened, still look at the sky, though (sky)
Sifter sippin', this not the Moscato (sifter sippin')
Bitch, I'm gifted, I'm smokin' gelato (bitch, I'm gifted)
We been the niggas that steppin'
We came in the door and they takin' the flow, call it repo' (bite)
My dog, he gon' bite, no Chico (arr)
Get hit with the Draco and make him with Rico (brrt)
Ain't shoppin' Rodeo
You wanna see the three Migos, then turn on your Vevo (vevo)
The Wraith colored mayo (white)
Countin' up cheese like I ate a bag of some Cheetos (cheese)
They must've forgot we the Migos (forgot)
Straight from the Nawf, out the bando (bando)
I done been quiet for too long (too long)
I copped that Cuban, it's two-toned (two-toned)
I heard he trappin', they tappin' the static
Tell that boy go get a new phone (brrt)
Out in Bel-Air, copped a new home (new home)
Avalanche with the blue stone (ice)
I am the shit, can't find a fit, my neck is a fridge
The rings and wrists, I retro the kicks
Ain't givin' no kiss, I'm givin' her dick
You starin' too long like you seen a ghost
So whip out your camera, take you a pic'
So when you get home, get back on your phone
Zoom in on the flick and look at the drip
She ask me to pay for the ass to get lifted
I told her, "I'm better off gettin' you a Lyft"
Think I'ma put all my trust in a hoe with no benefits?
Tell her go jump off a cliff
I go two-thirty, a cup of that purple
Put ice in my drink just to keep it on chill (lean)
Fuck all that talk, you ain't been in the field (nah)
Open my bank account, it give me chills (chills, Takeoff)
