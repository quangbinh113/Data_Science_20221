Song Name: One In The Chamber
It's Swidom
R14
Yeah
If there's one in the chamber, oh you know that we hittin him (yeah)
When you lookin for strangers, these niggas hittin civilians
Whether we make the money, take the money
I'm finna get me a billion
And I just subtract the paper from the balance
And pay out the hitters for gettin him
I told my gunboys step then bark
Don't do documentaries
Leave that phone go around get trenchy (uh,uh)
Two rambos skii wit a scarf like benji
I just dodged a mazzeen might ring up and call my frenchie
Bad b in a bentayga bentley
Big drip no brenya I'm feelin so trendy
Back den was mckenzie in the bando
On tour man grip on givenchy
Still gotta do what I do for the block
I'ma ball non stop with my tool don't tempt me!
Step one-two ruga or the winchest
Looking all lengthy
Rest up sheggy we still slap corn till we smoke on a henry
The shot shells plenty (grrrr bow bow bow bow)
Man I'm still on this paper route
Hmmhmm
Used to trap out the vacant housing
I was just trying to make it out with my dawgs
Now I'm shopping for audemars with the frost on it
This 9 mm sounds like exhaust on it
And if he a problem we gonna put a cost on him
Boy I tell ya
So we get the heaters out in the winter
Put 7.62s inside the sprinter
We give them head shots like its liquor
This lil nina a real head splita
Top of the league
Ain't no one harder than me in my city
Boy I tell ya
So I'm overseas
Tryna find someone who fuck with me
T I tell ya
Them youths love chatter we do not speak
Unleash switch chings with my cake no bleach
Tha opp try back up, I still got reach
He's a neek he dunno bout streets yo
I'm in dxb I can't smoke no trees
My names too hot I can feel the degrees
Benji where's the Gs?
I might haffi ring bundog for the Canada leaf yo
Long rams now the dirty katana can chop don't skeet
Opps ran off and lost their keys
They talk too raggo the smokes on lease
Two waps and their both guaranteed
I been too bad so I'm no nominee
You know the click back
Really drops to my knees
My tugs on badness
Free up my brodie cos that's my ski
Mhmmmm
Yeah
If there's one in the chamber, oh you know that we hittin him (yeah)
When you lookin for strangers, these niggas hittin civilians
Whether we make the money, take the money
I'm finna get me a billion
And I just subtract the paper from the balance
And pay out the hitters for gettin him
And I just subtract the paper from the balance
And pay out the hitters for gettin him
I was just trying to make it out with my dawgs
Now I'm shopping for audemars with the frost on it
