Song Name: DEAD RIGHT NOW
Breaker, breaker, 911, somebody come get this bitch
Thinkin' you a star on the rise, you got time to reply
Don't lie, you can hit my shit
You can lend me five lil' niggas on the side, lil' nigga
Couple thou', need to fix my whip
How you switch sides on a nigga who was down with you, nigga?
You a fraud, just a fib my nig', my nig'
You know, I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know, you never used to call
Keep it that way now
I'll treat you like you're dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You wanna fuck with me so bad right now
Well, now you can't right now, oh-oh-oh
2018, I was at my sister house the whole summer (yeah)
Songs wasn't doin' numbers (yeah)
Whole life was goin' under
Left school, then my dad and I had a face-to-face in Atlanta
He said, "It's one in a million chance, son"
I told him, "Daddy, I am that one"
Uh, uh, I ain't never need him, huh
I ain't never need no nigga, uh
I ain't never need no feature
If I didn't blow, I would've died tryna be here
If it didn't go, suicide, wouldn't be here
They all come around like they've been here
When you get this rich and famous, everybody come up to you singin'
"Hallelujah, how'd you do it?"
"You've been on my mind, you've been runnin' through", yuh (hallelujah)
"Hallelujah, how'd you do it?"
"You've been on my mind, you've been runnin' through", yuh (yeah)

You know, I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know, you never used to call
Keep it that way now
I'll treat you like you're dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You wanna fuck with me so bad right now
Well, now you can't right now, oh
Mama told me she was gonna stop fuckin' around with that nigga
Told me she'd be clean, but I'm knowin' that her ass is a deceiver
My mama told me that she love me, don't believe her
When she get drunk, she hit me up, man, with a fever like, woah
"You ain't even all that pretty, you ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with me, God won't forgive you" shit
"You ain't even all that pretty, you ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with me, God won't forgive you"
You know, I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know, you never used to call
Keep it that way now
I'll treat you like you're dead right now (I'll treat you like you're dead)
I'm on your head right now
You wanna fuck with me so bad right now (well, now you can't)
Well, now you can't right now, oh
I treat you like you're dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You wanna fuck with me so bad right now
Well, now you can't right now, oh-oh
