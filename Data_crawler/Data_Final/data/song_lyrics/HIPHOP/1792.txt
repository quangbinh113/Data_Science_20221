Song Name: Bando Baby Diaries
If your heart ain't fully in the streets, take your leg out
Serious
Yo, man like Mondo
Yeah
If your heart ain't fully in the streets, take your leg out
If your heart ain't fully in the streets then take your leg out
They caught him on the corner, gave him six, that nigga bled out
Niggas gettin' nicked, some snitched, team fell out
Gang started and ended in less than one year, this ting's dead out
She loves when I'm in her yard 'cause she ain't gotta beg
Two on one, six on three, that's how I pay my rent
Dependin' how the town's movin'
And what these other shotters got them used to
Psychology is crucial
I Google check the whole town then I route
And when I serve a fiend, they better put the shots in their mouth
I told these niggas, "Don't involve me in your raps"
Honour my wishes, don't involve me with your cap
I didn't travel hundred miles to do two for 15
Or four for 25, let that stay in the local trap
I infiltrate the town, I just need one local cat
I send a bitch to bring the burners up, see where your soldiers at
What you know about trap so far, to reload the whole block, it's gonna take a day?
Like, you can catch a plane or put it on a train
Blud, this point in my life, I just found so much comfort in pain
Who's to blame? Let me put this to you, simple, plain
I met a young G and his life was so innocent, tame
Knocked on my bando one time and I saw his face
He was my runner's friend so I never sent for him, he came
So I G-check him, ask about his life and what he's seen
He's a good kid, his mum kicked him out for smokin' weed
Apart from that, I can't say what went wrong
Blud, he played for the MK Dons
I'm like, "Call your mum and let her know you're in a dirty trap
And your life's about to change 'cause you'll end up servin' crack
I'll come back tomorrow, if you're here then you're here
But once you start this life, broski, I don't wanna see tears"
So I left and he did
And she said whatever she said but what she said didn't stick
So I come back the next day with pebs for the strip
He's like, "I'm here" and huggin' it, and, broski, "I ain't no kid"
I'm like, "Aight, G, best learn to bank and shank
Bando Baby don't lose no packs and don't get jerked
Do the nitty shotters, stay on volts, go berserk"
In six months, his life changed for the worse
I think he done four towns, got jerked
Jerked niggas, put in work, turned savage, turned worse
Court cases got turned
What this innocent kid with a grin turned into makes me sick
And you know how the dirty game ended
Fightin' for his life with a murder case pending
Mummy on the rows takin' all of the attention
The guilt that she feels broke her heart, she can't mend it
