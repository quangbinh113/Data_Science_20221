Song Name: Back In Business
Mama told me that I'd get rich up off this melody

Instead, I'm gettin' this bread and I put it all on my shooters and they felonies
Fuck is you tellin' me?
All hell, baby, we back in business (uh)
We out here talkin' like we back in business (yeah)
All hell, bitch, we back in business
Back in business, it's all hell, baby (uh)
My life is Scorsese
I'm whippin' four more until it's four based
Was trappin' it all, baby, we packin' them tall, baby
Go out to war, baby, it's work for all, baby (grr)
It's all hell 'cause we back in business
Off in this kitchen cookin', flippin' like I'm back at Denny's
And all hell 'cause we comin' with them MAC 11's (grr)
These niggas snitch, we cleared the witness, traffic, where we catch him (yeah, yeah)
Even my city, left me out for dead like I was baby Jesus (like I was baby Jesus)
They put me in that manger, I found my way to Egypt (I found my way to Egypt)
I'm out here Palmer, hit up the Jane too
My bitch from Rexdale, she in her lane too (she in her lane too)
I'm talkin' all now, fuck is your loyalty, nigga?
Niggas switched up and shit, and where was your loyalty, nigga?
When that shit hit, I told 'em I'll soon be royalty, nigga
Hit the block on the four and they tryna foil me, nigga
Niggas talkin' on stainless 'til they know that it's over
I'll be damned if this pussy nigga name in my disclosure
Legal aid is my lawyer, can't get out by the mornin'
It's like I'm stressin' for a day, all this stress on my head, whoa, whoa
All hell, baby, we back in business (uh)
We out here talkin' like we back in business (yeah)
All hell, bitch, we back in business
Back in business, it's all hell, baby
