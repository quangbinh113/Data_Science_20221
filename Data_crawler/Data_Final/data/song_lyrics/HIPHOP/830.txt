Song Name: Heartless - Live From LA
This life made me heartless, bitch, I came from apartments
The money turned me to a target, got a Hellcat Dodge it
I hope you lookin' down on me, I hope you're proud of me
Memories and the nightmares, need a guy to ride with me
'Specially 'cause I got lil' round one, 'specially 'cause I got an OG, ayy
'Specially 'cause I gotta go home, 'specially 'cause I gotta get this cheese
Talked to the streets, most them niggas wack
Most them niggas end up penitentiary from servin' crack
We done witness war times, it was facts
See my young hitter turn to a new assassin
He just wanna keep my strap, 'cause we keep on ridin'
And the judge gon' put him down, put him down, put him down
'Til he can't see the light again
This life made me heartless, I came from apartments
The money turned me to a target, got a Hellcat Dodge it
I hope you lookin' down on me, I hope you're proud of me
Memories and the nightmares, need a guy to ride with me
