Song Name: Till The Wheels Fall Off (feat. Lil Durk & Capella Grey)
Summertime, but it feels cold
Sun's out, it ain't shining low
I'm just tryna make it through the day
Ain't thinking 'bout tomorrow
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
'Cause there's darkness all around me
Told my brother we gon' slide (oh, yeah)
We gon' ride
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh, woah)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon'
Ride and we gon' slide (woo)
Free Wunna and Slime
Fighting for our lives while they get paid up off our confinement (woo)
They don't like the fact I went from Honda to a 'Rari (nah)
Bust down to a Plain Jane
Hate the shit you can't change (skrrt)
Tryna be a winner but I'll still be feeling lost in it (woo)
Trying not to sin but that shit hard when niggas crossing me (wow)
Holding back tears, tryna write me off (woo)
Bitch, you don't know how to love, guess your heartbeat off, yeah
I been going crazy, tryna save me ain't no antidote (woo)
I would say her name, but I ain't sayin' that shit anymore (woo)
Drowning out the pain, it's just a feeling you won't ever know
I'm a living legend, I'ma say it 'til it's time to go
I done put in heavy work
My children won't ever hurt (woo)
Riding for my people until heaven make another Earth (blatt)
They shot my nigga Bobby five times, I was hella hurt (ooh, woah)
Caught up in some politics
Now we on some wildin' shit (woo)
I just wanna see my niggas on without the candle lit (yeah)
Most my niggas learn how to get money, but can't manage it (ooh)
Couple of my bitches say the word and I'ma handle it (woo)
If my heart break, no compensation for the damages (yeah)
Never thought that I could feel so low
All that shit I did for niggas and they still so cold
And why that bitch I really love won't accept my lovin'?
I'm grown and I still don't know (oh, oh, oh)
Summertime, but it feels cold (feels cold)
Sun's out, it ain't shining low (oh)
I'm just tryna make it through the day (make it through the day)
Ain't thinking 'bout tomorrow (no)
As I lay me down to sleep (sleep)
I pray the Lord my soul to keep (soul to keep)
'Cause there's darkness all around me
Told my brother we gon' slide
We gon' ride
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (woah, yeah)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon'
I done got it out the mud, that shit was uncomfortable (uncomfortable)
Mama worked a nine-to-five, she left me five Lunchables (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All them guns your ass be postin', nigga still touchable (touch)
Had the police shoot out the bucket just to find the matchin' shoe (yeah, yeah)
All the hoop niggas wanna rap and all the rap niggas wanna hoop (hmm)
How you get more time for drugs like you the nigga who doin' the shootin'? (Ooh)
Brother died, I ain't wanna post 'cause they do the most at them computers
They like, "How you ain't GD and your daddy was under Larry Hoover?" (woah, woah)
I be wantin' to trip and grab the whip, but then I slide on 'em (slide on 'em)
You know I'm into it, stopped goin' live and stole my vibe off (vibe off)
I done wrote to jails when I was on the floor like, "Take some time off" (yeah, yeah)
He said "no" 'cause I kept smilin' in my mugshot (yeah, yeah)
We on e'rybody ass
All the shorties who real, who wanna slide, turn them droughts? (Skrrt)
I don't care where we at, we can have a shootout in Calabasas (brrt)
I'm ridin' with the culture, I hate what they tryna do to Travis Scott (straight up)
My auntie gone off the scotch
See a nigga I called my brother, he was in the trenches movin' my watch (yeah, yeah)
And I told you, "Ain't no drought," you think you the only nigga that got wok? (Nah)
And I told you, "Ain't no clout," nigga, you the only nigga that walk (yeah)
Told my brother we gon' slide
We gon' ride
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon'
We always scared to watch what we do (we do)
Same gang-gang with me since Robins and Trues (huh?)
Bluffin', they know we ain't hard to find (nah)
We been outside posted on the stoop, uh
That's why when our business blow, what them a do pon the internet?
Postin' for the opps to watch, nah, we're not into that
They know what it is, them silly, they don't try
Fine by me, you spilling, we gon' slide (oh)
Spliffs in the hallway (oh)
Rolling with my day-ones (oh)
Catch you on an off-day (oh)
Ain't no fuckin' fair ones
Down too long, can't lie
Now we're way too fly to cry, yeah
Summertime, but it feels cold
Sun's out, it ain't shining low
I'm just tryna make it through the day
Ain't thinking 'bout tomorrow
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
'Cause there's darkness all around me
Told my brother we gon' slide
We gon' ride
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
'Til the wheels fall off, we gon' ride (ooh)
