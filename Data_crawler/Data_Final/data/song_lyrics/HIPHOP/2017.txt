Song Name: Ball If I Want To
(If I want to, if I want to)

(If I want to)
D.A. got that dope
(If I want-)
Bitch, it ain't even my birthday, but I can ball if I want to (ball)
Pull up, foreign cars if I want to (skrrt)
Hop out that bitch with that iron in my jumpsuit (go)
Just do what I say and I'll love you ('kay?)
I get this shit from my uncle
I told bae get 22 inches of weave
Tonight, I wanna fuck a Rapunzel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't fuckin' her right, you ain't pullin' her hair (bitch-ass nigga)
Legs on the side of your head
Now fuck it, let's get in a chair (I said, "Let's go!")
When she throw that ass back, I say, "Yeah!"
I fuck around, get on a PJ tomorrow, and put that bitch up in the air
Fly that bitch up out of L.A. to Charlotte
To pick up my barber to come cut my hair
'Cause I'm havin' it, nigga
Look, me and my lil' bitch be dressin'
Get the salad, lil' nigga
Hop out that bitch with that ratchet (let's go)
Stunt like my motherfuckin' daddy (yeah)
Mama, your baby a savage
Uncle Ray hid his crack pipe in my mattress
This lil' nigga play with me, fuck it, I slapped him
Thought I was laughin', he see I wasn't laughin' (hahaha)
Bitch, it ain't even my birthday, but I can ball if I want to (ball)
Pull up, foreign cars if I want to (skrrt)
Hop out that bitch with that iron in my jumpsuit (let's go)
Just do what I say and I'll love you ('kay?)
I get this shit from my uncle
I told bae get 22 inches of weave
Tonight, I wanna fuck a Rapunzel (go, go)
Ain't fuckin' her right, you ain't pullin' her hair
I pull on and grip it, lock up her arms like she getting arrested
Throwin' her out like she getting evicted
Fuckin' me back, girl, that pussy impressive
Put one leg right here, put the other one there
Sexy lil' flexible bitch, you a pretzel
Tryna keep up with shit, but it's levels
And diamonds and Dior all over this sweater
It's fire on the front of my waistline
First nigga try me, it's playtime
Play 'round, you lay down
Doggin' her out like Cujo
Me and her get on the floor, and we fuck like some K9s
Pop a lil' nigga, gon' have to put you at the top of the list
Ain't no option, lil' nigga, they scared to let me in the room
Somebody in that bitch gotta be blockin' my pimpin', it's Baby
Bitch, it ain't even my birthday, but I can ball if I want to (ball)
Pull up, foreign cars if I want to (skrrt)
Hop out that bitch with that iron in my jumpsuit (let's go)
Just do what I say and I'll love you ('kay?)
I get this shit from my uncle
I told bae get 22 inches of weave
Tonight, I wanna fuck a Rapunzel (go, go, go)
Ain't fuckin' her right, you ain't pullin' her hair
