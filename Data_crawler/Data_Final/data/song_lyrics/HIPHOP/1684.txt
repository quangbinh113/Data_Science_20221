(Wheezy outta here)
Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn't for Google, man that b- wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell c-
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this b- can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don't like girls, bet this money make a b- so gay

Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in her back, pull out my money, make a b- bust a nut
Came out the bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
C- by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent
Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least 20 M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this b- cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these n- a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pills, I should've never f- the b-
I got h- these n- married, I don't let 'em go, they come through
I got my fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don't even care who these n- shot at
Ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a n-, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a n- like me give a f- 'bout a n- shooting up the church?
I gotta take this s- up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherf- new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad b-, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top shelf
B- still claiming me, I ain't f- in over a year
Cartier wrist, Cartier watch, Cartier diamond buff
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in her back, pull out my money, make a b- bust a nut
Came out the bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
C- by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent
Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
Stepped all in mud, this b- can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don't like girls, bet this money make a b- so gay
