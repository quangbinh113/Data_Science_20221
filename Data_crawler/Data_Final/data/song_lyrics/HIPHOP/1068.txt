Song Name: Come to Life
My soul cries out, "Hallelujah"
And I thank God for saving me
I, I thank God
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle, now he back in the pen'
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feeling low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone, I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
(Lose it right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floating on a silver lining (in the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, riding on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
All the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me
(Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, hallelujah, hallelujah)
Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life, make it all come to life
Praying for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight
Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'd come to life
And maybe they'd come to life
Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'd come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Bought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floating on a silver lining, floating on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free
