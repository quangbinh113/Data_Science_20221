Song Name: Simon Says
Get the fuck up, Simon says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
Queens is in the back sippin'
Yak y'all what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that
Act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty
Y'all know the name
Pharoahe-fuckin'-Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range, then your shit's inebriated
Phased from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with a long-term goal
Took my underground loot without the gold
You sold platinum round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street, then shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Roc-clock dollars flip, tips like a waiter
Style's greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holdin' up the wall, then you missin' the point
Get the fuck up
Simon says get the fuck up
Put your hands to the sky
Brooklyn in the back shootin' craps now what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties
Fuck it I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that
Act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty
(Yo, where you at?)
Uptown let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put 'em in the mausoleum
And the shit don't start pumpin' 'til after 12 p.m.
Ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree
I'm the most obligated, hard and R-Rated
Stated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
'Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're ridin' the train or in Lexus-es
This is for either or Rollies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holdin' up the wall
Then you missin' the point
Get the fuck up
Simon says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
The Bronx is in the back shootin' craps, now what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that
Act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty
New Jeru, get the fuck up
Shaolin, get the fuck up
Long Isle, get the fuck up
Worldwide, get the fuck up
