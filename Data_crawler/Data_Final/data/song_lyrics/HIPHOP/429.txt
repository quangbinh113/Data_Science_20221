Song Name: bad vibes forever
Ooh-ooh-ooh, get your grind on tonight, grind on tonight, in the end
Nigga, eyes rollin' in my brain, what we gon' do?
I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, in front of me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, got you grindin' all or nothin'
Grindin' all or nothin', in the end
Nigga, eyes rollin' in my brain, what we gon' do?
I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, in front of me
I said, hey, put your pride right to the side (Yeah)
I can waste your time
Or I can change your life, I said now
Oh, shawty, where you goin'?
I just need one moment
So baby, keep your focus
I said stay, stay, babe
Stay, stay with me
Stay, stay, babe
Please don't run away
Please don't stray away
Ooh-ooh-ooh, get your grind on tonight, grind on tonight, in the end
Nigga, eyes rollin' in my brain, what we gon' do?
I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, in front of me
(Oh, yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I can barely keep control
When you're grindin' all on me ridin' all on me
Girl, you take my soul, yeah (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you look like the girl of my dreams
My heart is on lock, need a key
It's right in your pocket, you see
Lost sense, no stress
I ain't tryna hold you back
Ice on, who bought you that?
Don't want you to go out sad
Girl, you know I'm fallin' for you (Yeah)
And girl, you know I'm all in for you (Yeah)
And I'm in love with you, everything you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh, get your grind on tonight, grind on tonight, in the end
Nigga, eyes rollin' in my brain, what we gon' do?
I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, in front of me
