Song Name: Red Light Green Light
Baby, probably in a fast car (shee')
Riding with the cap off (zoom), pull off with a bad broad (bad broad, oh-oh)
Think a nigga got here capping, I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off and back on that big homie (big)
Hop out that bitch, whip that shit on 'em, okay (D.A. got that dope)
Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em (hurr)
Red light, green light (boom-boom)
I'm fucking a bitch in my G-Nikes (let's go)
I hop out with that stick with that beam, like
My partner want see something killed, that's what he like (someone die)
So the first nigga tried gon' tell G, "Hi"
I been 'bout that motherfuckin' sack since a knee-high (since a knee)
This is a nappy-haired, black, afro'ed peon (let's go)
I have emotion, I'm prime-time like Deion
Now she throw it, I'll snatch from the behind (huh)
Hol' up, look at the fit on him (look at the fit)
Go get the tissue, there's shit on him (shit)
Lie for me, die for me, kill for me (shit)
Dick in the butt, though, she lick on me (okay)
I told her, "Bae, show me you love me" (okay, show me, baby)
"Let 'em know out in public" (let 'em know)
"Uh-huh, let 'em know why we fucking"
They try me and go down, and know why I'm coming (doot-doot, doot-doot)
Yeah, rich ass stepper (-the biggest)
White seats, bitch, that's leather (white seats)
I wanna fuck her and her friend
All her birds are the same feather, they flock together (let's go)
I'm dangerous, they probably tell you (what they say?)
"Don't play with him", they 'bout whatever (don't play)
Uh, I get in there, she say I'm precious (get in there)
Anywhere, anytime, bitch, whoever, but hold up
Baby, probably in a fast car
Riding with the cap off (zoom-zoom, zoom-zoom), pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here capping, I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off, back on that big homie (park it)
Hop out that bitch, whip that shit on 'em
Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it (okay)
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em
Red light, green light (let's go)
Nigga touch one of yours, he gon' see right (gon' see)
I'ma spend every dollar 'til he die
I make him slide, 365, he don't think right (doot-doot, doot-doot)
That's 11 months straight, niggas sleep tight
I tried to be patient when niggas, that ain't right (nigga try)
Give them game they couldn't take, niggas ain't in (uh, uh)
Rate me, one out of ten, they gon' say ten (say ten)
Threw that bad bitch on camera, let bae in (okay)
Who that is? Back to back, hoe, that's Baby (it's true)
Can't do no shows, he fills stadiums
I like my Lamborghini's 'cause they drive fast (okay)
But the Maybach is probably my favorite whip
I'm in the backseat with my feet up with client (back)
Get my dick rolled like a Mercedes-Benz
And I pop big shits, so I don't trip when they talk (big)
If you dish shit out, you gotta take it in (okay, okay), I be like, "Hold up"
Baby probably in a fast car
Riding with the cap off, pull off with a bad broad (okay, let's go)
Think a nigga got here capping, I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off, back on that big homie (big)
Hop out that bitch, whip that shit on 'em (let's go)
Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it (okay)
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em (brrr)
Red light, green light
Bitch, okay
Uh, oh-oh-oh-oh-okay
I'm back on that big homie, park it
Hop out that whip with that shit on 'em
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em
Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it
Red light, green light
