People tend to lose it, they see you comin' up
And you were talkin' stupid, you wish you bit your tongue
You blood is burning butane, I know it eats you up
And I just keep it moving, that envy got you stuck (Oh, yeah)

Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here (Uh)
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
In a Lambo truck, it's not a Panorama
Even though I got the vision and it's panorama
I grew my vanity out base and made it out Atlanta
But the closest thing to tropic was the Tropicana (Yeah)
Yell it for the guys, pour it for the guys
Tell my dawg 50 on the other side
Pop me one, pop me two, pop me three

Middle fingers to the ones that's not here (Yeah)
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here (Uh)
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost (Yeah)
Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost (Yeah)

Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
I'm a bad man, just with good things
