Song Name: Earth
What up, world?
It's your boy, just one of the guys down here
Well, I could be more specific
Uh, I'm a human
And I just wanted to, you know
For the sake of all of us earthlings out there
Just wanted to say
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge
Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?
I'm a lion cub, and I'm always getting licked (Meow!)
How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo!)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)
I'm a fat, fucking pig
I'm a common fungus
I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole
I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up
And I'm Kanye West
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth
Ba-dum-da-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead
We're just some rhinos, horny as heck
I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?
Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you
I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk
What the fuck? I'm a clam!
I'm a wolf. Howl!
I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut
And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (Yah)
Giddee-up, let's ride
I'm HPV, don't let me in
I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute
We love you, India
We love you, Africa
We love the Chinese
We forgive you, Germany
Earth, it is our planet (It's our planet)
We love the Earth (We love the Earth)
It is our home (Home)
We love the Earth, it is our planet (It is our planet)
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth
I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me?
(Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit
(What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love the cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet
Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live
Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum
우-우-우리는 지구를 사랑해요
Amamos la tierra
我们爱地球
(We love you, we love you)
C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)
Have you ever been to Earth?
Everyone who is listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here
Are we gonna die?
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't believe Global
Warming's a real thing. You know?
We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid
Unless we get our shit together now
