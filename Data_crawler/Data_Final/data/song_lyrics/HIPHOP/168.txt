Let me tell you something 'bout my life
And every single chain, and my diamond rings
The way you walking the way you talking it's all because of me
And the way I'm all on you, girl, you know it's true
The way I speak is my melody
Don't you ever think it's another me
Girl, on everything, it's a lot on me
I cannot be seen, I cannot be takin' apologies
Yeah, they proud of me 'cause that bag on me
Yeah they after me, I got racks on me
Got the stash on me, think they gassing me
Yeah, hoodie on low but I stay focused
Yeah, it's hard to stay low when everybody notice, yeah
Look back at it

Said she never made love, but she good at it
She make a nigga feel good when I look at it
I get goosebumps when I look at it
Oh, girls just wanna have fun with it
