Song Name: Like Us
Um, Reuel, stop playing
Take-take it easy workin' 9-to-5
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
Always keep them stacks just like us?
Almost threw up in my tour bus
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know
Left wrist just like "ooh", right hand just like "ooh" (Chi, chi, ooh, ohh)
Neck on bae like "ooh", my chick bad like "ooh", ooh, ooh, ooh
What if God was just like us?
What if God moved like us?
What if God cried like us?
Struggle went on bus to bus
E'rrybody on the same drug
E'rrybody want the same look
Keep it real with my day ones
Don't like nothing of that fake love
Threw up on the tour bus
Man, I swear I grew up these past four months
Shawty want the crew, it's more than four of us
Made a hit and blew, God opened doors for us (hello)
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Almost threw up in my tour bus
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know
Left wrist just like "ooh", right hand just like "ooh" (Chi, chi, ooh, ooh)
Neck on bae like "ooh", my chick bad like "ooh", ooh, ooh, ooh
In God we trust (I didn't trust nobody)
No hate, all love (No hate, it's all love)
Bezel shine like the sun (Bezel shine like the sun shine)
That comes from above (Give it up for God one time)
Keep my head up on all one of y'all (Gotta keep my head up)
Pop like a pimple, keep on trying us (Pop like a pimple)
Girls be tripping just to get to us
Scottie Pippen, that's my shooter, yeah
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Almost threw up in my tour bus
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know
Left wrist just like "ooh", right hand just like "ooh" (Chi, chi, ooh, ooh)
Neck on bae like "ooh", my chick bad like "ooh", ooh, ooh, ooh
