Song Name: Face no Book
I just got this beep
Yea, yea, yea
All night bitches hit da joint
The trophies in themselves for all night stop playing
Hmm, Yeah, hm
I just pulled up in a
Hmm, wait
I just pulled up in a benz
Let me bring yo friends
If you ain't throwin neck baby
You can't get up in
And I ain't goin in if I can't bring the Glock in
I can't do the 9-5 I could never clock in
I was never up in school, I was out Flockin
Bitch i'm Mr. Turn Nothing Into Somethin
We don't do no succa duckin
We them niggas that was born to cause rucked
Slidin on the succas at 3:00 in the morning in a bucket
I'ma die behind my grammy's
If he touch it ima up it
0.45 if a nigga think he Mr. Incredible
Ass so fat I be mad that it ain't edible
She said the nigga sucked good that
She turned me to a vegetable
Bitch don't ask me what i'm doin
Like it ain't money on my schedule
If you wanna take it there
We can take it there
Best believe that ima risk it all if it's paper there
I be at his bitch house all the time I get faded there
Hm, They don't want no smoke i was out on they block
Tryna terrorize they whole gang but nobody out
Hm, we the ones that yellow tape the whole crime scene
I'm the young nigga with the chili so they don't like me
Bitch i'm toxic i'll block you while you typing
Why the fuck you call me over and your clothes on
I know she ain't shit cause she don't never leave her phone on
Hm, Girl you bad i'm tryna fuck you with the lights on
I'ma lock her in as pretty face in my iPhone
If I show up at 3:00 in the morning you know what i'm on
Skinny winny lightskin little brace face
Beat the yocky up got the bitch screamin "gang gang"
Got her toes curlin signs like she gang bang
Hold on... Damn hm, tuh
Bitch you bad and you know it
Fine in the face you got ass baby throw it
Put it in my face, baby who you bank with?
Wells or the Chase
See the sauce that i'm drippin'
She like "daddy can I taste"
And you know that I'ma join but can I get some space
Blood full of pain, smoke good cook
I've been gassin' up all this time without a chorus or a hook
I was offered a couple of shots when I almost got booked
I didn't ran off on the plug, I mean the shit got took by a bitch
Skinny face all day no book
