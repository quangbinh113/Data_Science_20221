Song Name: fallin'
Woke up not feeling this morning
Last night she packed her things up, I watched her leave
I read the note that you left out on the counter
Still hear your voice inside my head, it cuts deep
Now I'm free falling
More than you can see, I've lost a part of me
Now I'm free falling
And you're not catching me, guess it wasn't meant to be
Turns out she don't wanna talk now
She not a surgeon but she really took my heart out
Love sick got me feeling nauseous
Gave you my mind and you went and filled it up with nonsense
I guess you made up your mind
I knew it, I could tell by the look in your eyes, ah, ah, ah
Woke up not feeling this morning
Last night she packed her things up, I watched her leave
I read the note that you left out on the counter
Still hear your voice inside my head, it cuts deep (cuts deep)
Now I'm free falling
More than you can see, I've lost a part of me
Now I'm free falling
And you're not catching me, guess it wasn't meant to be
