Song Name: Holidae In
Bomb ass pussy
Ma, ooh, you got that bomb, know you got it
Ma, ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma, I know you got that bomb, bomb pussy
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
Peeps call me up, said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 the Natural Bridge road
I'm already blowed, get thurr I'm a get blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Vallet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like, "Wassup"
I told em follow me, they knew I had it cracking B
One said, "Ain't you that boy that be on B.E.T?"
Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in here, I heard 'em whispering
Talking about, "That's that dude that sing, 'Right Thurr' he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, talk, I ain't come to sit, sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon' hit, aww, shit
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
Ma showed up, "Hey, what's the hold up?"
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom, seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said, "Can I be in yo video?", I'm like, "Yeah! Oh really?"
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring the camera
Then I thought about it, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin' like they from an island
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
Stop, drop, kaboom! Baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender bittles
Doctor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little, "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
Fo shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae Inn
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing, chillin' at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another, let the party begin
Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, disturbing the peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah, bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holidae Inn
Bring a gang of that Hen, some D S O P
Oh wee, and light that sticky-icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Know what I'm talking 'bout
We gon' disturb the peace right now
Yeah, we ain't doing nothing but chillin'
We chillin' and nuttin'
Know what I'm talking bout, so push the button
You know what's happenin', fa shizzle, uh huh
Yeah, bitch, trying to run from this pimpin'
You can't out run the pimpin' bitch, I done told you
