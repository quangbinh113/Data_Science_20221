Song Name: Maze
Stuck in a maze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stuck in a maze, mmh
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows I've been through
Story to be continued
I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the
Weight that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I'm not in my subconscious, I'm conscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this
I took my demons into the bank of life and
I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows I've been through
Story to be continued
