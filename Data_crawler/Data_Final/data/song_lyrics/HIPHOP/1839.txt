Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get 'em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It's the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothing nice
I try not to wear nothing twice
I came up off of shooting dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't living right
My sis' and 'em doing aight
My cuz and 'em still serving life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheating
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, "I'm the one," they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, then they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathing
They making it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix
Money, cars, and clothes, and hoes
You know I live in the mix, money, cars, and clothes, and hoes
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me, we fuck up your block
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (keep going)
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support you personally
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be capping, them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothing to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like
"Damn, he was fucking with me," yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix
Money, cars, and clothes, and hoes
You know I live in the mix, money, cars, and clothes, and hoes
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Bitches be talking like they really rich
But really be begging me under my pictures
I'll give her 40-50,000 cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Going to Cali', I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the load, ain't no room right now, I took her to the O'
Then I pulled up on the Lamb' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fucking up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry
I'm standing on all the blocks
This the anthem, mhm
Dropping the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats remind me of sitting on Panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sit on my lap 'cause I'm pulling her tracks
And I fuck from the back 'cause she calling me handsome, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix
Money, cars and clothes and hoes
You know I live in the mix, money, cars and clothes and hoes
