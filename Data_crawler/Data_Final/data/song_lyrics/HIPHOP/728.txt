Song Name: Real Life (feat. Roddy Ricch & Mustard)
Mustard on the beat hoe
Cops still killin' niggas in real life
Signed a deal for eight figures in real life
Threeway, model bitches, in real life
I done been around the world so many times
That's real life
Real life, real
It's gon' be ups and downs for a real nigga
Tryna make a dollar out of a nickel
All the haters see that we gettin' money
The whole Taylor Gang ringin' bells
Ten toes down, in the Chanel
Oh, hate me, go check the timе, flooded out my AP
I ain't got time, they ain't tryna pay mе
Jumped in the Porsche, and the new Mercedes
Did a song with Beyoncé and JAY Z
So many sacrifices, this ain't happen overnight
Puttin' that work in real life
I spent a M on this ice
Cops still killin' niggas in real life
Signed a deal for eight figures in real life
Threeway, model bitches, in real life
I done been around the world so many times
That's real life
Real life, real
Me and my brothers countin' up a million, in real life
I remember we was marchin' through the field, in the night
Had Glocks, we was posted outside all day
When my dawg got out the court, I put him in tennis chain
We was stackin' up the chicken, I counted up ten a day
I've been ballin' real life, give a fuck what a nigga say
We real life trap, the packs was in the bay
Double R, floor matte and the new Bentayg'
Fuck up cheese, ayy
We was slidin' in a 'Rari on the freeway
She want a threeway on a C-day
I told her eat the dick up like a cheat day
We havin' her homegirls inside the PJ
Panoramic views, on her everytime she look up
Gangsta real life, none of these niggas ever shook us
Got a couple million put up
And I still shine when I pull up
Bitch, I came from the bottom, put the whole damn hood on
Cops still killin' niggas in real life
Signed a deal for eight figures in real life
Threeway, model bitches, in real life
I done been around the world so many times
That's real life
Real life, real
