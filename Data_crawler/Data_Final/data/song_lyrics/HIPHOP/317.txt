Song Name: Antisocial (with Travis Scott)
All you cool people, you better leave now
This is about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (Yeah)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (It's lit!)
I don't mess with your energy (Nah), no photos (Ayy)
So antisocial, but I don't care (Ayy)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (Ayy, pop it)
Got a bottle in my hand bring more though (Ayy, pop it, pop it)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up!)
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
(I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need, I need)
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes (Yah), might catch fumes
When I zoom (Pew), when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
(Hit the ground without movin' baby) (Ooh, yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (Drown)
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" (Yeah)
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can't hit it
(In the back) Seen the vision in the boy, then we commit it (It's lit!)
I've been lost out in outer space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
(Don't touch me, yeah yeah)
