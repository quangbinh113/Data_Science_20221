Song Name: Moonwalking in Calabasas Remix
Ballin' since I was a jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits, I had a goal to get rich
Mama was strugglin' paying the rent, I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
'02, old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like how you get that lit
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I'on know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owned that shit
Mama I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' that Benz and she live in L.A.
Tryna thank God but don't know what to say
Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
Unless it came with a pool and a gate
Check the rear before I pull in the gate
All my watches flooded just like a lake
Lately, I've been showing up extra late
Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
Four for four Wendy's, get her a plate
Love when these nuts all up in her face
She say, "Wow", never met a nigga with dick in her house
Spit in her mouth, dick in and out with the chopper
In the couch for a rat or a mouse (wow)
Mmm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louie bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mmm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we 'on't fuck with Jacksons
Bet when I dropped, they 'on't post that shit
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow, you'll owe me bitch
Humble ass nigga, but I know I'm rich
Yeah, I'm rich as fuck
Fuck that shit, I know I'm lit
If we beef, I fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence 'cause players' ain't into that
No-oh, I hit his bitch on the low-oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me, you broke, that's tough
That's tough, that's tough
Blueface and DDG, hoes at the 'BnB
Watching a DVD, giving her dvd
2020 Wagon, A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Get too close, it go beep-beep-beep-beep
Roadrunner, all he heard was, "Meep-meep-meep"
Nyoom, 750 in the horse
Hopped off the porch and I crashed the Porsche
Hop out the bed and I smash the whore
Knock-knock, guess who's at the door?
Oops, forgot I ordered that Dior (wow)
Came in straight from Europe
Spent 400 on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X', she sleepy, sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish, no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini
Mmm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louie bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mmm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we 'on't fuck with Jacksons
Benjamins, we 'on't fuck with Jacksons (wow)
I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
