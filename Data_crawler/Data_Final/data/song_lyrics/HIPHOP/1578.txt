Song Name: Ghetto Superstar (feat. G Herbo & Doe Boy)
I got a bullet with your name on it, fuckin' kill 'em
So fuck your eyes, as I sip this Glock, we twistin' livers
(Southside on the track, yeah) I got a bullet with your name on it, fuckin' kill 'em
So fuck your eyes, as I sip this Glock, we twistin' livers (Mustard on the beat, ho')
My money don't sleep (sleep), I'm slow to speak (slow to speak)
Pour the whole P (woo, woo), It's holy (woo, woo)
Take 250 (yeah, yeah), right overseas (yeah, yeah)
I'm a ghetto superstar, like I'm ODB (I'm ODB)
My closet clean (yeah, yeah), rock everythin' (yeah, yeah)
He wanna shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, let it ring (woo, woo)
Take everythin' (woo, woo), and flee the scene (woo, woo)
Real red fiend, ready for anythin'
My young niggas seals, they popping off, hightail and drop 'em off
Internet, they tough as hell, outside, they cotton soft
Drink got a nigga high as hell, I was damn near nodding off
Floor seats, I be fly as hell, wrist frost, I could buy a loft
350, my service fee, an extra one is courtesy (ooh, yeah)
Had the Phantom out in London, told 'em "Close the curtains, please"
And she be (and she be), with me every week (with me every week)
Miami Beach, with Doe Bee off a tee (a tee)
New Fazo's, I don't crease 'em up, my Maybach creepin' up
They don't pat me down at no club, I gotta keep it tucked
All the gang ties rooted, like a fuckin' tree trunk
Just make sure you put some respect on it when you speak of us
My money don't sleep, I'm slow to speak
Pour the whole P (let's go), it's holy (let's go)
Take 250 (let's go), right overseas (go)
I'm a ghetto superstar, like I'm ODB (Doe Beezy)
My closet clean, rock everythin' (no, phew)
He wanna shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, let it ring (baow, baow, baow)
Take everythin' and flee the scene (go)
Real red fiend, ready for anythin' (oh, really?)
I hit Roddy line, I saw the opps, I got the tee (go)
When B-I-G D-O-E got the tee, it's R.I.P. (Baow, baow)
Big Doe Beezy got the tee, I sip dead niggas when I drink (Beezy)
Get your bitch up off my D, I'm not my Cuban, I don't link (come here)
I don't link, I don't even answer my phone, ho', I don't speak
I got rich, I pay a maid now, but I'll still a sweep (baow, baow)
Sweep his ass like seven games, I come through clutch, I did a three (swish)
I'ma up this big ass switch, you get a scratch on this big B (skrrt)
Bentley, stripper so amazed, so I'm flyin' Benji's (mwah, come here)
Opps said it's on sight, too bad my enemies don't match energy
Still ridin' 'round through Cleveland in a droptop, ain't goin' like Kennedy
Catch up, I got Mustard, bitch, send my deposit instantly (oh, really?)
Big Doe Beezy, nigga, top shotta, Don dada
You know what the fuck goin' on, Double R, what's poppin'? (Grrah, boom, boom)
Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I got a switch on me, hold on
Hold on, hold on, roll the Double R window down real quick
Pussy, grrah
My money don't sleep (sleep), I'm slow to speak (slow to speak)
Pour the whole P (woo, woo), it's holy (woo, woo)
Take 250 (yeah, yeah), right overseas (yeah, yeah)
I'm a ghetto superstar, like I'm ODB (I'm ODB)
My closet clean (yeah, yeah), rock everythin' (yeah, yeah)
He wanna shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, let it ring (woo, woo)
Take everythin' (woo, woo), and flee the scene (woo, woo)
Real red fiend, ready for anythin' (woo)
Shoot, don't need a screen, I'm with the dream team (G Herbo)
Reds on, all we knew was green beams (grrt)
I ain't tellin' nothin', but I seen things (I seen it all)
Ain't no failin' us, we like the SAT's, uh, ayy
Went from wintertime, rollin' up on G's to L.A. breeze
Moved to L.A., hoes can't get enough of me, they on they knees
Spent a million, I can't wait 'til I beat my case, I'm like, "Please"
Quick to show a nigga this barrel, like a sheriff, I'm like, "Freeze"
Quick to buy new Vs, quick to buy VVs
Make her get fly like me, make her ride like me
But I can't trust no hoes, they quick to lie, like me
If she don't flex and she don't front
I give her a diamond, Saint Laurent, my money don't sleep
My money don't sleep (ayy), I'm slow to speak (I'm slow to speak)
Pour the whole P (whole P), it's holy (it's holy)
Take 250 (250), right overseas (right overseas)
I'm a ghetto superstar, like I'm ODB (like ODB, know that)
My closet clean, rock everythin' (rock everythin')
He wanna shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, let it ring (he go, brr)
Take everythin' and flee the scene (flee the scene)
Real red fiend (real red fiend), ready for anythin' (huh, huh, huh)
I got a bullet with your name on it, fuckin' kill 'em
So fuck your eyes, as I sip this Glock, we twistin' livers
I got a bullet with your name on it, fuckin' kill 'em
So fuck your eyes, as I sip this Glock, we twistin' livers
