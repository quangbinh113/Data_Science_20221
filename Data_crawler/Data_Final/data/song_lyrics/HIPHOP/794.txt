Song Name: Sittin In My Car (feat. Fabolous & A Boogie Wit da Hoodie)
Yeah
Look
When you tell me pull up, I'm there
You know I'm real, that's real
So don't have me waiting too long, yeah
Now we sittin' in my car
'Bout to take my shot like I'm sittin' at the bar
Shawty wanna smoke so we lit one in the car
Now we layin' in the cut like hitman in the car (hold up)
Ass so fat, it barely fit into the car
I'm looking at them lips while she hittin' the cigar
Tryna play cool but it's getting kinda hard
Nah, deadass though, it's getting kinda hard
She like, "Yeah, okay, all your shit been up to par"
"But just 'cause you want cookie don't mean you gettin' in the jar"
I told her trust her gut then I hit her with a bar
If you don't trust the driver, stop gettin' in the car
She said I'm not a bird, didn't say you are (ain't say that)
I'm just making wishes while we sittin' under stars (yeah)
Only baddies in the Wraith sittin' with the Rs
Besides, I hate birds, always shittin' on my car
You putting up a fight but I didn't come to spar (I know)
I'm not the fuckboys tryna hit you up tomorrow
To keep it real, I'm just tryna dead that
Show me what you think, let me see where your head's at, baby girl
When you hit me up, I'm there
You know I'm a real, that's rare
I won't have you waitin' too long, nah-nah-nah
You know how to pull me up when I'm down
And that's why I'm still around
I won't have you waiting too long
Now I'm just sittin' in my car waiting for you
Now I'm just sittin' in my car waiting for you
Nah, nah, nah, nah
And if I ever disrespected you
Apologies, I just can be a little skeptical
I never mean to be OD and I be stressed with you
I just be tryna OD when I have sex with you
I hope you don't go tellin' everybody 'bout it
I ain't afraid, I just don't wanna be around it
Yeah, I was raised up where they love to man down shit
Hit 'em up and then his body never found
My Louis belt connected to my pistol
My pistol connected to my hipbone
My hipbone connected to my you know
And you know, yeah, you know everybody I know
And I don't wanna change locations
I don't wanna feel so basic lately
I been whippin' two doors lately
I don't wanna use my spaceship, but baby
When you hit me up, I'm there
You know I'm a real, that's rare
I won't have you waitin' too long, nah-nah-nah
You know how to pull me up when I'm down
And that's why I'm still around
I won't have you waiting too long
Now I'm just sittin' in my car waiting for you
Now I'm just sittin' in my car waiting for you
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
