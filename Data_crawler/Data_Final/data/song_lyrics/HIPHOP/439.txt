Song Name: Cap (feat. Lil Durk)
808 Mafia
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Put some pep in your step, you got cap in your rap
Boy, you broke, boy, you broke, and you not allowed to trap
Got a big bankroll, got a hundred on my lap
Got a big bankroll, I can't fit it on my lap
I mix Gucci, Valentino, say you mix it, then it's cap
Acting stingy with that pussy, I'ma give that bitch a stack
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
I done put ten bands on the booty, I
Spent ten bands on my Louis, I
Went on a date for the coochie, I
Seen her fall in love with a goofy, yeah
Go to Texas, sip lean like I'm Bun B (Uh)
Strip club, make a hundred bands up in one week (Uh)
Seen a grown bitch shake her ass in a onesie (Uh)
How you talkin' cash but not seen with no money?
Say you gettin' money, that's salary cap
Drip no good, that's style from the tap
I can see through every smile, every dap
Snitch ass nigga go to trial and recap
Bitch-ass-ness at an all time high
Ain't a big face, you a small time guy
Bad bitch 'round, she on all timelines
No video but we call time fly
Amiri jeans came, army fatigue laid
Came from Delta, now I'm ridin' a PJ
Why you playin'? I need bands like DJ
Don't believe rumors, they know that we straight (Yeah)
I smoke out my hotel with my broad
If she don't fuck, then she gotta pay for that charge
Put some pep in your step, you got cap in your rap
Boy, you broke, boy, you broke, and you not allowed to trap
Got a big bankroll, got a hundred on my lap
Got a big bankroll, I can't fit it on my lap
I mix Gucci, Valentino, say you mix it, then it's cap
Acting stingy with that pussy, I'ma give that bitch a stack
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
Yeah, young nigga cap, new era
Put it to the side of your cap, New Era
Had to get it right 'cause I made a few errors
All the bullshit in my rearview mirror
Cam in the dash, no rearview mirror
If the money talk, I'ma hear you clearer
Pretty brown skin, lookin' like the new Lira
Shawty timeless, it don't matter who era
2019 open doors for the kid
Rolls truck cold, got doors like a fridge
No lies told, it's a fact where I live
Brooklyn team wear black where I live
Niggas don't play but we ball like Nets
Team 'bout green so we ball like Jets
Big diamonds so we ball like Mets
Been doin' this so we all like vets (Yeah)
I came up, I'm the captain of the team now
Step my game up, no cappin' on the team now (Yeah)
Shit so vivid, I be rapping like a freestyle
They don't even live it, they be rapping what they see now
Put some pep in your step, you got cap in your rap
Boy, you broke, boy, you broke, and you not allowed to trap
Got a big bankroll, got a hundred on my lap
Got a big bankroll, I can't fit it on my lap
I mix Gucci, Valentino, say you mix it, then it's cap
Acting stingy with that pussy, I'ma give that bitch a stack
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
When these drugs rinse down, I'ma turn up to the max
