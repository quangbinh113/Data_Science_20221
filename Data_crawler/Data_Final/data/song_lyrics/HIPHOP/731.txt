Song Name: Weeeeee
Loaded, what up?
I'm a big dawg who you wanna be (yeah)
Diamonds on my wrist and on my teeth
(Yeah, Big 14 know what the fuck is goin' on)
I smoke zaza, I'm in La La, off them trees (woo)
Took the T-tops off the 'Vette, I need a breeze (yeah, yeah)
And I do the fuckin' dash like Need For Speed (skrr)
I don't need a bitch, what a bitch need (yeah, yeah)
She was off a X pill, now she want E (oh)
She went up a molly ramp and she went, "Wee" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got a pound, know what we doin' today
I hang with them killers, they ruin your day
I'm feelin' good, I'm super today
Been with the gang and we feel like Sly Cooper today
Got a Bently but I just might Uber today
Got a beam with me like a Storm Trooper today
Hella stones on me like I'm a Medusa today
And I'm blowin' up like I'm a boomer today
I'm a superstar, you a consumer today
All-back whip look like a Puma today
I'm a king, I'm with Timone and Pumba today
In your dreams, I'm big Freddy Krueger today
Don't make me pop out with that ruler today
Stretch your bitch on my dick, it's like Zumba today
If they like to shoot, I'm a shooter today
Do the drill on a motherfuckin' scooter today
Teach the world, I might become a tutor today
She wan' fuck, I might toot her and boot her today
Call here OVO thing, come from Hooters today (yeah)
B-L-double-O-D, I feel booler today (blood)
Play with ice like a motherfuckin' cooler today
Count up a mil' in the Cullinan (yeah)
Spent half a mil' for the fun of it (yeah)
If we talkin' money, bitch, I got a bunch of it
I'm a big dawg who you wanna be (yeah)
Diamonds on my wrist and on my teeth
(Yeah, Big 14 know what the fuck is goin' on)
I smoke zaza, I'm in La La, off them trees (woo)
Took the T-tops off the 'Vette, I need a breeze (yeah, yeah)
And I do the fuckin' dash like Need For Speed (skrr)
I don't need a bitch, what a bitch need (yeah, yeah)
She was off a X pill, now she want E (oh)
She went up a molly ramp and she went, "Wee" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Weeeeee
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, weeeeee
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ooh, weeeeee
