(Donnie Katana)
Ayy
She got the low cut like Halle Berry (ah)
Ain't never seen nothin' like that, she got me starin' (wet)
Her pussy poppin' when the leather seats cherry (yeah)
I'm steppin' in my Crocs with the Louis sleeves (uh-huh)
I'm half awake, jaw-locked, I can't even speak (ah)
I'm drivin' in my '97 black Mercedes (yeah)
I'm in the ocean on a boat, feelin' wavy (wavy)
I'm pushin' coke like I'm in the 1980s (yeah)
I'm pullin' up, what the fuck? Got me brazy (Trippy)
(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up" yeah)
Juicy J the plug, I'm well-connected in this bitch (hmm-hmm)
So many bottles to my section like B. M. F. was in this bitch (ayy)
I ain't gotta shoot my shot, this Memphis pimpin' don't miss
If she look at me too long, you know she coming home with
After bottle service, I get swallow service, she a freak
She gon' lick the lollipop before we make it to the suite
She impatient, she hate waiting, this shit's amazing
Don't want no mani-pedi, she keep begging for a facial (ah)
Smoking on this Cali weed, this shit here look like tie-dye
I landed two hours ago, but I'm still sky-high
This Instagram model with me, she ain't all that pretty
If I take another shot, this bitch gon' look like Halle Berry, God damn
(She ain't bad at all) she ain't all that pretty
If I take another shot, this bitch gon' look like Halle Berry
She got the low cut like Halle Berry (ah)
Ain't never seen nothin' like that, she got me starin' (wet)
Her pussy poppin' when the leather seats cherry (yeah)
I'm steppin' in my Crocs with the Louis sleeves (uh-huh)
I'm half awake, jaw-locked, I can't even speak (ah)
I'm drivin' in my '97 black Mercedes (yeah)
I'm in the ocean on a boat, feelin' wavy (wavy)
I'm pushin' coke like I'm in the 1980s (yeah)
I'm pullin' up, what the fuck? Got me brazy
