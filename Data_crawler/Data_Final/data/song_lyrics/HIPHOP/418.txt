Song Name: Quarter Milli (feat. Gucci Mane)
Yeah, Metro, Metro-Set
You know what it is, uh
Uh, yeah (Woo, woo, woo)
I made a whole mil' off of the dribble (M&M)
Bought a Richard Mille quarter milli' (Richard Mille)
Sippin' out the seal hurt the kidneys (Sippin', seal)
Trappin' Bobby, R.I.P to Whitney (Brown)
Lamborghini, 12 come get me (12)
Audemar Piguets, one-fifty (Piguets)
The ball-man make one call (Boss, brr)
Hit him with the saw (Raa)
Pull up, Ferrari, creep, crawl (Skrrt, skrrt)
Then I put my wrist on froze (Ice, yeah)
Yeah, I went rose-gold with the Patek (Patek)
I had to grab the choppa for the static (Braa, braa)
Mama in Celine, fuck my daddy (Mama)
Luther King with the dream work magic (Luther King)
Pinky ring start a scene need glasses (Pinky ring)
Get to floatin' off the lean like Aladdin (Woo, woo)
Had to switch lane, my pattern (Switch lane)
Rolls Royce, it's a ghost like Casper
Came through drippin' in the peacoat (Drip, drip)
I was sittin' in the pen, face the Rico (Woo)
My daddy on dope, tryna keep low (Dope)
Put the AP on my mama she on fleek, ho (Woo)
Double C's on my feet valentinos (Double C's)
I got 13 M's, Dan Marino
Don't work in a gym, work a kilo
Knock, knock, who is that? Check the peephole (Who?)
We get to kickin' like pedal (Woo, woo, woo)
Diamonds dancin' like Fabo (Fabo, Fabo)
Flip a nigga's ass when I say so (Say so, say so)
With a Glock, not a Draco (Glock)
Connect the dots like a Lego (Dots)
Chicken in the wheel, MAACO (Woo)
We did the independent takeover (Independent)
I make a bitch get the makeover
Kickback like a Maybach Benz (Kickback)
.38 with the beam back then (.38)
Stay clean and the money comin' in (Stay clean)
1988 my lens (88)
Fucked the bitch then she ate her friends (She ate)
What you got in the safe? I want in (Safe)
Pew, pew, pew, pew, get spinned (Bow)
Hunnid racks, I can blow it in the wind
I made a whole mil' off of the dribble (M&M)
Bought a Richard Mille quarter milli' (Richard Mille)
Sippin' out the seal hurt the kidneys (Sippin', seal)
Trappin' Bobby, R.I.P to Whitney (Brown)

Get to floatin' off the lean like Aladdin (Woo, woo)
Metro, Sizzle, Wiz, Offset and we got so much bread (Wop)
Bury us in Dolce, bitch and cover us with bread (Damn)
All this money pilin' I might buy a private island (Huh)
All this private flying private jettin' to different climates
Elliot and Fezzy teamin' up they got me wet (Fezzy)
Told my bitch to bury me in nothin' but baguettes (Mwah)
Knockers, but my Tech cup
Is that Rolls Royce truck, it's red pussy please don't push me 'cause
I'm so close to the ledge (It's Wizzop)
I made a whole mil' off of the dribble
Bought a Richard Mille quarter milli' (Richard Mille)
