Look, woo
Look (woo)
I'm downtown Chicago, on Michigan Ave with Polo and we on some woo shit (woo shit)
I walk into Saks Fifth with a bad bitch, and we both feelin' ruthless (ruthless)
If I see a opp in the spot, I look him in his face like, "You ain't gon' do shit" (nah)
Saucy (saucy), too lit (too lit)
Headshot (headshot), clueless (clueless)
They fell in love with the movement, when I see a opp and I'm boomin' (boaw, woo, boaw)
You get the money, it come with confusion, don't try to teach me, nigga, I know what I'm doin' (ayy)
Fivi (Fivi), uh, uh, saw me and started droolin' (woo)
Big dope (big dope), boofin' (boofin')
Snowflake (snowflake), coolin' (ayy, ayy)
I get the money and dip, huh, I don't go to war 'less I'm fully equipped, uh
Everywhere I go, I'm good with a bitch (ayy, ayy)
Yeah, look, I got a fast whip, shooter shootin' then he pass grip, uh
Don't say you smokin' on my niggas, (nah) 'cause that be your last spliff (bitch)
Hitter with me, he do mad hits, turn my bitch into a bad bitch
Drop a song and I got mad lit, all I did was give 'em ad-libs, ayy
Ayy, ayy, too rough but know how to play, uh
I did a show, that's out of state, I make them bitches go out of their way to see Fivi (ayy)
Look (woo)

I just took a jet from the 'Raq in New York with the gang and we on some woo shit
And we really outside, and my crew lit, we too deep, ain't nobody gon' do shit (lil' bitch)
And if it's a problem, my young nigga shoot shit, stakin' out like a date up in Ruth Chris (ayy)
In the field, we took more than a few risks, Mike Amiri jeans full of blue strips (ayy, ayy)
I might get frostbite, all this ice on me, tell him stitch me a new wrist (lil' bitch)
I just dropped ten racks up in Louis, I spend like a band on my new kicks (Lil' bitch)
Make a hater throw up, 'cause my coupe sick (ayy), I can't fuck on that ho, 'cause I'm too rich (ayy)
(Make a hater throw up, 'cause my coupe sick, I can't fuck on that ho, 'cause I'm too rich)
