Song Name: Creepers
Grr
Come on
Come on
They gon' chase you
They gon' chase you
(Rage, you goin' crazy)
Huh
We don't brag 'bout what we do (we do)
We don't speak on what we see (we see)
We don't drive-by shit no more
We hop out cars and get on feet (come on)
Bin this block with this new Glock
This bitch'll switch swish up like cheese
And we known for them chase down niggas
Can't run when we creep (creep)
Creep through
We gon' jump out, chase you down
Them youngins get on feet too (huh)
Slut, she fucked my bro, then turned around and ate my meat too
(She, she)
This bitch nasty
I ain't got to tell the folks to blow, likе Jimmy Neutron, he gon' blast it (grr, grr)
If I point, he shoot (hе gon' shoot)
He gon' get up close (get up on 'em)
If they score on one of ours, we gon' even the core (we gon' get up on 'em)
Tell 'em, "Free lil' bro," I hope he beat his case (I hope he beat it)
He gon' come and hunt shit down, we gon' come eat his face (we gon' come eat it)
I was gon' address the rumours, but, I can't it's fake (this shit fake)
I can't argue with no troll, don't click that shit, it's bait (that's clickbait)
Uh, niggas be cappin' (cap)
You ain't slime shit out for real, you think this music shit just rappin' (huh)
Niggas swear they hoes gon' fuck with boo 'til I come through and crack 'em (huh)
We box niggas up for real, no Christmas gift, but, we'll rap 'em
We'll rap shit up (rap it up)
Bad, bad, clap shit up (clap it up)
We make niggas switch locations, go on and pack it up (get out of here)
Huh
We don't brag 'bout what we do (we do)
We don't speak on what we see (we see)
We don't drive-by shit no more
We hop out cars and get on feet (come on)
Bin this block with this new Glock
This bitch'll switch swish up like cheese
And we known for them chase down niggas
Can't run when we creep (creep)
We don't brag 'bout what we do (we do)
We don't speak on what we see (we see)
We don't drive-by shit no more
We hop out cars and get on feet (come on)
Bin this block with this new Glock
This bitch'll switch swish up like cheese
And we known for them chase down niggas
Can't run when we creep
