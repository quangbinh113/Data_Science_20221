Song Name: Spicy (feat. Post Malone)
Damn, James
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like there's money on the floor?
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars?
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it?
She my spicy lil' mama, she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow, ayy
Who tryna, who tryna go?
Who nigga hope that she don't?
Who tryna slide for the night?
Who tryna wife her? Not I
Know my name, say my name
Yellow diamonds on my chain, lemonade
I can never be your main, but tell your man
You gon' have to call him back another time
Girl, let's get out and vibe
Go up, get loud
Get right here and now
Yeah, tell me
Who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like there's money on the floor?
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars?
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it?
She my spicy lil' mama, she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow, ayy
She tryna pull my pants down
I was lightin' up a stoge on my break time
Told her, "Babe, I got a meetin' over FaceTime"
She don't care, my lil' mama never waste time (ooh)
Gotta catch a flight real quick
Took a Xanny on the plane in her fuckin' lipstick
She look at me and laugh, give a fuck what I think
And she badshit, she a crazy, but I like her like this, yeah
Shawty so bad, man, shawty so cold
Wanna go out, 25 years old
Met her in the club, they were playin' "Psycho"
Now we match APs and they all rose-gold
And we both can agree
Ooh, she wilder than me
Yeah, tell me who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like there's money on the floor?
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars?
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it?
She my spicy lil' mama, she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow, ayy
