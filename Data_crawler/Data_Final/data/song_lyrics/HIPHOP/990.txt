Song Name: More Time
Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Keep the intro
Oh, my boy, you already know
Ah
More time
Melly and D-Nice still in the cage, more time
That ain't gon' stop us from getting paid, more time
Certain things ain't never gonna change
Never speak to them guys without your lawyer 'cause they giving more time
My mans died, I put him on a chain, more time
A lot of niggas can't handle the pain, more time
I'm a hard animal to tame
Saw my son killer sitting on the train, give a nigga more time
Look, if my mans down, nigga, I up and get 'em
Max Payne, I'm doing TECs and Berettas
Never trust a boy, it's always a setup
If I see an opp, I bet I'ma wet 'em
New speed, I bet I change up the level
Make it rain, I bet I change up the weather
To walk through, I need 25 and better
Old hundreds, have 'em sticking together
Louis V and Amiri the denim
My mans up top rocking Gucci sweaters
Red bottoms, Rollies in the pen
Pinky ring Cartier lens
Ride around big body Benz
Blacked out, all you see is tints
See, me, I ain't worried 'bout men
Act up, get a shot to your chin
Hollow tips got acquired taste
Get straight, boy, my brother an ape
Catch a body, then I'm back in the cave
If you don't got a body, you can't relate
If you don't bang, you can't get in the car
Big woo, know I'm shooting them stars
Mama begging me to pray to Allah
Walk in the mall, niggas know who we are
41 millimeter plain jane
Niggas get locked up, start naming names
Pussy nigga, get the fuck out my way
Ma, I'm sorry, I'm just stuck in my ways
Hello
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
I like my bitch Spanish, she yellow
Her ass fat, feel like Jello
She said she want Chane-ne
Pop Smoke on the TV (ah)
I did 15 on my check-ins (yeah)
She said she didn't believe me (nah)
Until I pulled up in a foreign (ah)
And I cashed out on a TD
Snowman like Jeezy
VS, I'm freezing
Red bottoms, I'm bleeding
Louboutin when I'm stepping
Stone Cold what I'm repping
Big .38 for the weapon (ah)
Man down, check the scoreboard
I'm a bulldog with this .44
Break legs like Paul George
Said, I break legs like Paul George
Grrt
