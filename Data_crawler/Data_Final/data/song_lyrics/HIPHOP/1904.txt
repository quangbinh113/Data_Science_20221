24, 34, 46, good and thick
And once you get it she'll work wit it
Put a face and some cute lips
Earring in her tongue and she'll know what to do wit it
Make a name for herself, and she do her shit well
And know how to keep her business to herself
Come over anytime a nigga call chick
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, (ding dong) and she right there
And she know why she came here, and she know
Where her clothes suppose to be (off and over there)
Sniff a little coke, take a little x
Smoke a little weed, drink a little bit
I need a girl that I can freak wit
And wanna try shit, and ain't scared of a big dick
And love to get her pussy licked by another bitch
'Cause I ain't drunk enough to do that

I need to know a whole lot then to teachin' a broad
With my ding dong take her tongue and tickle the bong
Hold on, that's the only one I gotta do that for
I'm spoiled (and I don't like to work that hard)
I like to lay back, relax, and enjoy my time
And with my eyes roll back and my toes curl
(I love when you do that girl)
'Til it comes time for me to have to give her hers
Tell me what you want, do you want it missionary
With your feet crammed into the head board?
Do you want it from the back with your face in the pillow
So you can yell as loud as you want to?
How 'bout on the floor? Do you want it on the chair?
Do you want it over here? Do you want it over there?
Do you want it in ya pussy? Do you want it in ya ass?
I can give you anything you can handle
