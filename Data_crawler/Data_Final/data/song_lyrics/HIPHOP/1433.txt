Song Name: Real Talk
Mustard on the beat, hoe
Real talk, let's get straight to it
I got diamonds in the face
No, these niggas don't walk how we walk
They don't talk how we talk, we got millions of straps
I grew up with the trillest niggas, trying not to stay with the fakes
Ayy, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, hey
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, yeah
Gang, gang, gang, I got the gang, gang, gang
Hopping out the Bentley Mulsanne, Eliantte chain swing
I can make a bitch mood change, got it in my pocket, loose change
I came from the bottom, I came from the mud
I came from the street always road running, sometime' we ain't even sleep
And I pray my niggas watching over me
We stand for the streets, what it's supposed to be
I lost a lot of people that was close to me
Grab the dope out the car like it's groceries
She say, "Roddy, sing to me like Jodeci"
Put my dick on her neck like a Rosary
I got control of me, these niggas don't know
Real talk, let's get straight to it
I got diamonds in the face
No, these niggas don't walk how we walk
They don't talk how we talk, we got millions of straps
I grew up with the trillest niggas, trying not to stay with the fakes
Ayy, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, hey
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, yeah
Gang, gang, gang, I got the gang, gang, gang, pfft, yeah
A quarter to sit, I black out the whips, I hold up a fist
I'm big as it get', colossal as shit, enormous as a bitch
Know that these niggas don't like me
I know that these niggas don't like me
Nigga, I been in the field, been toting my glizzy, doing high knees
Mafia, mafia, millionaires, only in the blue faces we trust
I told shorty, mind her business 'cause I came straight up out the Guinness
Spent 100 at the dentist
We ain't Venus, Serena, my dawg out the court
I put that nigga right in a tennis
Who you know designer down, fresh white tee?
New Hellcat, I was a fresh '19
How a nigga felt rich without two Cs?
Ain't nobody out-vibing me
The number one, but I ain't try to be
I told that bitch that there no lying to me
You can play yourself, but ain't no trying with me
Real talk, let's get straight to it
I got diamonds in the face, yeah, yeah (yeah-yeah)
No, these niggas don't walk how we walk
They don't talk how we talk, we got millions of straps
I grew up with the trillest niggas, trying not to stay with the fakes
Ayy, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
Gang, gang, gang, gang (gang, gang, gang, gang)
Gang, gang, gang, gang, hey
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, yeah (trillest, yeah-yeah)
Gang, gang, gang, I got the gang, gang, gang
