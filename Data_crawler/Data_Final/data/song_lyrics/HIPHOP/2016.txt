Song Name: Onna Come Up
Ay, in this bitch still cappin' with them, on bro
Go, go, go
Right now, onna come up
Lately been talkin' my shit, because I know I come from the gutters
Send shots at ya brotha
Then I go pop out in all of this linen like I was a baller
How can you hate me? I'm comin' from under
Nowhere to sleep, what the fuck is a cover?
Now I pop out in Balenci's, they runners
Man, tell 'em, "Stop tweakin', I already fucked her"
I was down bad, no one to the dollar
Was servin' the fiends, lettin' the Xannies dissolve
If I gotta problem, I'm makin' one call
Won't none of yo' niggas be slidin' at all
Bitch like uh oven, I'm packin' that heat
Only get out wit' bitches when it's in the sheets
Run to the paper like I'm in a meet
Baby, get on yo knees, let me give you uh treat
Too much of the Wocky be havin' me sleep
But too much of the Percs got me ready to freak
Grindin' for months, I been grindin' fo' weeks
My uncle told me to just watch for the weak
'Cause they like to sneak
Gucci and Prada be havin' me drippin' like I was a sink
Man, what did you think?
I'm tryna make it, to put some VV's inside my Cuban Link
Man, why do it sting?
Kobe been bringin' in pounds of Xa
But y'all know that it reek, you niggas not street
I can hire youngins, that's 13 and under
Put you on a tee, and they do it for free
We was in stakes, we was servin' the fiends
They all told me to stop poppin' the beans
Rival at teed almost stealin' my dreams
I like droppin' them Xannies inside of my lane
Lil Eazzyy been workin'
Keep passin' yo' moves, we got them bitches twerkin'
We see in the cut, and that nigga been lurkin'
Can't see in the track, 'cause we closin' the curtains
Don't know what I'm feelin'
Seems like the niggas who doubted me most is always in my mentions
You know I ain't trippin'
Drop me a check and that boy be away, and my transaction pendin'
Before the pandemic, my niggas was clickin' some rentals
Can't wait to hit Johnny to fuck up my dental
Blue tips in the 40, it fuck up his mental
We put him on TV, like he Jimmy Kimmel
My niggas some refs, we'll attack like a whistle
Hollows in his flesh and his skin start to sizzle
You know we erasin' a nigga like pencils, then skrrt out the way
No, my niggas get little
But don't lemme get started, a four
On the rocks got me lookin' retarded
Niggas be hatin', that really be garbage
Go for that paper, some niggas departed
But I never cared, tryna get big and see green everywhere
My niggas on go, why y'all niggas be scared?
Offa the Wocky, get harder to stare
But I'm on my way up, see you when I'm near
Skrrt, ay, see you when I'm near (go go go)
