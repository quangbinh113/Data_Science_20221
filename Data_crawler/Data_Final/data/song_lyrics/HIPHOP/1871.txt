Song Name: Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin') (feat. Yung Joc)
Shawty snap (yeah)
T-Pain
Damn, shawty snap
Yung Joc (shawty)
Shawty snappin' (yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy ayy)
She snappin'
Yeah, snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yourself
Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Muzik, Nappy Boy, ooh-wee
I know the club, close at three
What's the chances of you rollin' with me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk and forget what we did
I'ma buy you a drank
And then, I'ma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah, oh, oh) ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh), ooh, ooh (woah)
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Crunk juice bombs, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Let's get gone, walk it out
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gon' have fun, you gon' see
On that Patr√≥n you should get like me
I'ma buy you a drank, woah, ooh
And then, I'ma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, oo, (woah, oh, oh) ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh) ooh, ooh (woah)
Won't you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece deserve Louis one three
150 a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checkin' your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout an hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it, so he can make it clear
I'ma buy you a drank, woah, ooh, woah
And then, I'ma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah, oh, oh) ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh) ooh, ooh (woah)
Let's get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out think 'bout it, oh, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self
Let's get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out think 'bout it, oh, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self
I'ma buy you a drank
And then, I'ma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah, oh, oh) ooh, ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh, ooh, ooh (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh) ooh, ooh (woah)
