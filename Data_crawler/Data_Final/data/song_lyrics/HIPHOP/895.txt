Song Name: His & Hers (feat. Don Toliver, Lil Uzi Vert & Gunna)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh)
Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin
When I pop out, it's a (blicky)
We roll up, we roll up (sticky)
The other bitches, they be (shifty)
I pay for my shit, ain't (shit free)
Take some time (hee, hee)
I know how I get when I make that mine
Shawty, I break that spine
Roll that dice
No covers, sex on ice (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no lock and key
Just beep, beep, beep up in my Jeep
Baby, take off the belt of the seat
Touch-free, I brought some ones
Shawty have fun with funds
Tongue out on camera
Stretchin' out that Saint Laurent
She brought two friends, twin-twins
Casamigo killer
Fucked up off that liquor
Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin
When I pop out, it's a (blicky)

Shawty, I break that spine
Toolie in that Birkin (Birkin)
You and me, I got you, that's for certain
We split a G6, it feel like surfin' (surfin')
Talkin' to that big guy, tryna wash out my sins (wash out my sins)
She was massagin' me (me), catered to a G (G)
I don't gotta tone up her body
She already got a physique (physique)
Left from Croatia and landed in Greece (Greece)
I took her heart off her sleeve (sleeve)
Love how you keep it a hundred and that's really all that I need
I'm a big dog and she on my turf
I just hope you know your worth
Baby, hit that back and burp
Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
