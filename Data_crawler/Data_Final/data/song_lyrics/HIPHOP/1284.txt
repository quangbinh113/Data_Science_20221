Song Name: GTA
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Nigga, you know I know
My life grand theft auto
All my guns on semi-auto
Look like I hit the lotto
Up the traffic, duckin' potholes
Slow down, which way the opps go?
These niggas chicken, Roscoe
I'm the truth, ain't gotta lie, ho'
I see fake shit through a blind fold
You the type to see shit with your eyes closed
AP watch, I'm in a different time zone
Lil' cousin walk around with five on him
You would know better if you knew what I knew
Tryna be me, tell 'em do what I do
Gotta keep a Glock everytime that I move (forreal)
Nigga, you know I know
You ain't know, I used to drill for the low
Right aftеr school, I'm changin' my shoes
Ain't gotta tell me, I just go
I fuck with 6Hunna, so boy, I just blow
Ain't gеt shot, but boy, I was close
He made a diss and now he a ghost
And it happened fast, ready to toast
Von dog hoes like K-9
And he keep a strap, like KI
All he shoot shit from the three like AI
He was with the shits since yay high
Dropped the low, I'm on my way now
How many bodies can't hide no face tats
All the little kids know I don't play that
No, I don't play that
Now you know I know
My Glock filled with hollows
All my cars on Forgiatos
Who killed dude shit, how would I know?
Keep that rocket, like I'm otto
My pockets big, apollo
I'm the king, Mufasa
Who shot Wooski? How would I know? (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
Nigga, you know I know
My life grand theft auto
All my guns on semi-auto
Look like I hit the lotto
Up the traffic, duckin' potholes
Slow down, which way the opps go?
These niggas chicken, Roscoe
I'm the truth, ain't gotta lie, ho'
I see fake shit through a blind fold
You the type to see shit with your eyes closed
AP watch, I'm in a different time zone
Lil' cousin walk around with five on him
You would know better if you knew what I knew
Tryna be me, tell 'em do what I do
Gotta keep a Glock everytime that I move
Nigga, you know I know
