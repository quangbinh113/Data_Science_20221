Song Name: Forever Ever
Yeah, turn that up
I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit
For-ever, forever, forever forever, forever, forever, for-ever
Forever, forever, forever, forever forever, forever, for-ever...
Forever, forever-ever baby
Would you love me, forever-ever baby
Would you fuck me, forever-ever baby
Would you kiss me, forever-ever baby
Top floor, I was in the nosebleed
Like I just dropped diamonds I'm flushing
None of these niggas can smoke me easy
Tour bus smoking on that musty
Know I been in love for a while
You gon' make me fall in love for a while
Hop in the SLS for a while
Baby girl got me so obsessed for a while babe
You gon' really have to hold me fucking down babe
'Cause I ain't with the fuckery that playing round babe
Unless we playing in the sheets, baby mad laid
Forever-ever in them cheeks, baby mad cake
Forever-ever getting cheese, baby mad cake
Yeah, getting mad cake
Yeah, getting cheese getting mad cake
Dick down baby bust it on your whole face
AP, had to go and ice the whole face
Yeah, nigga fresher than some Colgate
Hanging with some big gorillas, yeah they go ape
Talk down, pussy nigga be cold case
Yeah 'cause I'm forever a thug, ever a thug
Baby I'm forever in love, ever in love
Make me feel better with love
When I said I love you, bitch, I say that with love
Yeah I'm forever a thug, ever a thug
Baby I'm forever in love, ever in love
Make you feel better with love, better with love
When I said I love you, you bitch I said it with love yeah
I'm watching the highs get hypnotized
We Bonnie and Clyde but except the shots
Speaking of shots I slip and shot the mindset bitch
Diamonds so Actavis bottles your T-Rex shit
There's diamonds and money and friends but your girl love me
But believing the bitch is a sin so I don't remember that
Pimp dress talk, I can make that work walk
I'm a gangsta, you a cop nigga bad luck
Forever, forever-ever baby
Would you love me, forever-ever baby
Would you fuck me, forever-ever baby
Would you kiss me, forever-ever baby
Top floor, I was in the nosebleed
Like I just dropped diamonds I'm flushing
None of these niggas can smoke me easy
Tour bus smoking on that musty
I need the racks, the cheddar, forever-ever
I need them bands, them bands, forever-ever
Why you playin' with this ice now, forever-ever
Oh no no no Imma never let her
If he don't love you like he should I can love you better
Oh, if he don't fuck you like he should I can fuck you better
Put the busses out the lot, put the brakes on the pedal
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Just know that this drip lasts forever
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Forever forever forever forever
