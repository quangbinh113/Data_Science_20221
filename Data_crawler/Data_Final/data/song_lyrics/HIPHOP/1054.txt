Song Name: Jonah
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Hard to keep my focus on what matters
Mandem hit my line like, "Some - just got hit up on your block"
You can rest assured it's not us
'Causе we been out the wave catching wavеs
They say, "We ain't seen you on the block"
'Cause I been out the way
Chasing millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway
I pour up a drink for all my - who ain't see the day
Tryna finish this with who I started with
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven
You can vibe out and just hear this s-
It's just certain - you can't forget
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Kanye and Jay still brothers, they both billionaires
And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear
I got your son and your daughter like you still here
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still
26 years, pops got out to see his son killed
And I don't give a fuck if I hang with a Crip, I see blood still
I can be the cleanest millionaire, I'm from the mud still
Died with his chains on, I call it blood diamonds
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find us
And it's been months and they still haven't
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Smoke a opp pack, ain't funny like that
It get ugly like that, can't get no money like that
Holy Father, please, let me step in
Can't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that
Whole lotta steppers and they stepping
And they sunny like that, and they coming right back
And when you on tour, bet you check in
'Cause my guy back to work, it's a Monday like that
And when you text, change the beginning of every word
You speak to me with only no cap, me and your big homie go back
Homie don't rap, you don't know me like that
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
