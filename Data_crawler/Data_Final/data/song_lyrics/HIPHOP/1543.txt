Twin Glocks named Zack and Cody (Holy moly)
Party pooper just like Mr. Moseby (Ooh)
Do a mission in my Sprinter van (Sprintin')
Hop out, niggas sprintin' (Runnin')
Hit him in the back, rip through his stomach (Ugh)
Shoot the club up, ain't tell I was comin' (Ooh)
This ho hit and I ain't even have to punch in (Punch in)
Up the .23 like Jumpman ('Sup then?)
Just in case a nigga try to jump in (Jump in)
Jump in, jump in, jump in

Put my gun to his lip like he kissin' that bitch (Bitch-ass nigga)
I'm up in his house, I ain't sendin' no diss (Nope, knock-knock)
You childish, lil' nigga, I'm a grownup (Big dog)
Put this dick in her mouth like a donut (She is)
If a nigga want smoke, we gon' roll up,

Every time that I shoot, bitch, you know I'm not missin' (Brr)
Leave that boy jaw like a Popeyes biscuit (Yeah)
Fucked up in the head, better keep your distance
Pull up and shoot like Andrew Wiggins
