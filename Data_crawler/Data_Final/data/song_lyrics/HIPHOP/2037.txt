Song Name: Masterpiece
Psst, stop (huh)
Noticed how I looked you in your eyes (let's go)
Next time, a nigga gettin' shot
If you really love me, fuck me like a thot
If you really love me, do what I say (DA got that dope)
When you give me head, look me dead in my eye (go)
Nigga play and I'ma set it on fire
My lil' bitch is a masterpiece
I ain't even gotta be funny when I'm tellin' no jokes
She still gon' laugh at me
Still suck my dick when she mad at me
Let a nigga makе me mad, you'll see
I nod my head in this bitch
Them niggas gon' slidе on your bitch-ass for me
Buss down Cartier, new Master P
My lil' bitch is a masterpiece
I ain't even gotta be funny when I'm tellin' no jokes (yeah, uh)
She still gon' laugh at me (yeah, uh)
Still suck my dick when she mad at me (yeah, uh)
Let a nigga make me mad, you'll see (yeah, uh)

Buss down Cartier, new Master P
Let down the window, you see me (skrrt, let this bitch down)
We got AR's, .45's, nines, and the two-tone Lamborghini (let's go, let's go)
I walk in the bitch by myself
Nigga still got on all of his bling-bling (bling)
I'm so rich, drop the top on that 'Rari
Got lil' bruh in this bitch with that thing-thing (that ting, nigga)
They just told me that somebody die
But it don't bother me, that's a G thing (so)
No, it don't bother me, it's the G way (G)
I don't know what went down at that Walmart (uh-uh)
I don't know what happened on that freeway (doo, doo, doo)
Okay, there go DaBaby, he back now
Run it back, hey, bitch, turn that on replay
Oh, he still got that shit with that bop in it?
Oh, they thought that lil' nigga went pop, didn't it?
I'm one of them superstar rappers who actually poppin'
Who really gon' pop niggas (I'm one of those)
We really done pop niggas
Tryna see one of you lil' niggas up, take the clout which ya
And I got this lil' boo thing
Soon as I went a got her a purse, put my Glock in it (yeah, yeah-yeah)
Like bae, you my bitch now
She know I don't mean no disrespect, I just talk different, nigga
My lil' bitch is a masterpiece

Niggas think I'm from Detroit
But I come from that 704, Charlotte made me (704)
And you can come play if you want
I'ma leave yo ass cold like Detroit on the pavement (doo, doo, doo, doo)
Who fuckin' with Baby? Just laughed at you
Quick to beat a nigga up, leave him snaggle teeth (uh, uh)
Hoppin' on a jet to get a bag or two (let's go)
Prolly gonna need to do some therapy
Had the moments, I always feel lonely (uh-huh)
Just walked in the meetin', and I got it on me
They don't know that I got it on me (uh, uh, uh)
I done a whole lotta millions while in a pandemic (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I ain't even out there performin' (go)
Clown ass nigga, better ketchup
You ain't even mustard, that shit, that bologna (eugh)
New boo look like a Barbie doll straight out the package
Had to buss her out the wrapper (mwah)
Nice ass, fell in love with a real nigga (mwah)
Time to turn her to a savage
A nigga play with me, I'll prolly burn him on camera (boom)
Damn, a rapper killed a rapper
Big player, it don't matter what happened before
What really matters happens after
My lil' bitch is a masterpiece
I ain't even gotta be funny when I'm tellin' no jokes
She still gon' laugh at me
Still suck my dick when she mad at me
Let a nigga make me mad, you'll see (go)
I nod my head in this bitch
Them niggas gon' slide on your bitch-ass for me (oh, oh)
Buss down Cartier, new Master P (oh, oh)
My lil' bitch is a masterpiece (oh, oh)
I ain't even gotta be funny when I'm tellin' no jokes
She still gon' laugh at me (oh, oh)
Still suck my dick when she mad at me (oh, oh)
Let a nigga make me mad, you'll see (oh, oh)
I nod my head in this bitch
Them niggas gon' slide on your bitch-ass for me
Buss down Cartier, new Master P
