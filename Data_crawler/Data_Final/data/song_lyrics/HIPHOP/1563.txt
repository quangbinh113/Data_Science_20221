Hello baby, kilo-kilo kilonshele
Omo komole, shake your, shake your bumper baby
Muy bonita, señorita, te amo mamacita
Hennessy, no tequila, ay caramba, shake up your bunda
Hello baby, kilo-kilo kilonshele
Omo komole, shake your, shake your bumper baby
Muy bonita, señorita, te amo mamacita
Hennessy, no tequila, ay caramba, shake up your bunda
Baby shark, goo-goo, ga-ga
Goin' straight to the top, Mashallah
Wanna dick down Steff, Astaghfirullah
Would've picked her up but I'm too maga
Stephanie, hot like lava, haffi mek, Lady Gaga
Take my time and rev, then go faster
Took a break, come back ten times harder
But hit that plenty, missionary, I hit that gently
Bu-buss my ting 'til my whole ting's empty
Russ get shelly, so, boy get ready
She won't let me go, gyal tip pon toe
Then she whine down low
Man rise that pole and I let that go
Two-step, red Buni, my blood, my bro, yo
Rev, rev that ring, ding-ding
Ching that, ching, ching, ching
Brought the fire and ping
Demon time, I can feel the jinn, jinn, jinn
Rev that ring, ding-ding
Ching that, ching, ching, ching
Brought the fire and ping
Demon time, I can feel the jinn, jinn, jinn
Hello baby, kilo-kilo kilonshele
Omo komole, shake your, shake your bumper baby
Muy bonita, señorita, te amo mamacita
Hennessy, no tequila, ay caramba, shake up your bunda
Hello baby, kilo-kilo kilonshele
Omo komole, shake your, shake your bumper baby
Muy bonita, señorita, te amo mamacita
Hennessy, no tequila, ay caramba, shake up your bunda
Real life rider, come with my niner
Gyal take time, ah, look how she whine, ah
Bedroom bully ting, mash up vagina
016, used to trap off a Lyca
Killy with the milly get-, she wan' get freaky pon' (sh-shotta)
Don't get bun like cigarette (bullet)
Man a big shark, you a likkle fish (bullet)
Yo, killy with the milly met Izzy
She wan' tek willy, get freaky pon' dicky
Unruly, cut through with my killys
And see me man, big lizzy, no flicky (bullet, bullet)
Your man so timid, baby told me why you're still with him?
I can't respect them boys, they some gimmicks
Selective yutes but they don't admit it
Rev, rev that ring, ding-ding
Ching that, ching, ching, ching
Brought the fire and ping
Demon time, I can feel the jinn, jinn, jinn
Rev that ring, ding-ding
Ching that, ching, ching, ching
Brought the fire and ping
Demon time, I can feel the jinn, jinn, jinn
