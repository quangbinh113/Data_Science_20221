Song Name: i can't stop
No, you can't break me now
I stopped smoking for a day, and now the vibes aren't right
I stopped the drinking for a phase, and now I'm lonely at night
I like to use it for the pain because inside of my mind
Behind my skull has taken a toll on my life
Goddamn
Tell me why I can't just fucking be happy without the drugs
Don't give a fuck about my life 'cause it's crappy
I need help
So I go to writing songs 'cause they catchy
And if I fell would you catch me? Don't even answer
You're out of your damn mind if you say yes
Don't ask me how my day went
My smile I be faking
My heart is fucking vacant
That means it's fucking empty I ain't got nothing left
Without the drink or the smoke, man I'm so fucking depressed
Like shit I need to stop, I need to start cursing less
But I'm stressed, it's really hard with all the weight on my chest
But I guess I'll try
But I'll probably mess it up like everything else in my life
Right?
I gotta little sentimental right there, real quick
Sometimes I get a little mental, I'm just dying to live
I think my life is rigged, I'm trying to fit in
But when you're broken in the mind it isn't easy to fix
I stopped smoking for a day, and now the vibes aren't right
I stopped the drinking for a phase, and now I'm lonely at night
I like to use it for the pain because inside of my mind
Behind my skull has taken a toll on my life
Goddamn
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Do you dare me to drive? Lols I ain't Stan
But I am crazy inside behind my skull be doing the most
Without the drink or the smoke, man why is life so dull
I don't know
And when I talk it's like I'm talking to a ghost
Because nobody gives a fuck, so I be bumping rock 'n' roll
And I be smoking on the loud and I be ripping on the dope
Don't care to ask if I'm okay 'cause homie I don't even know
Shit don't ask about my life because I don't even got one
I'm hot, son
Looking down the barrel of the shotgun
Pac once wrote a couple of songs to
Save a life and now I do it every night
Because I just gotta save my own
Alone no home I ain't got nobody on my phone
'Cause I don't condone the fake shit
A facelift is what I need to smile on the basis daily baby
Everybody hates me, listening to Kurt look at the of cover of the baby
Wavy, swimming in the pool just like the navy
Crazy, living life in search for a dollar
If you tryna save my mama homie I wouldn't bother
I stopped smoking for a day, and now the vibes aren't right
I stopped the drinking for a phase, and now I'm lonely at night
I like to use it for the pain because inside of my mind
Behind my skull has taken a toll on my life
Goddamn, huh
Shit
Goddamn
Con
