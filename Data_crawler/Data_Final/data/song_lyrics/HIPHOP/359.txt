Song Name: SKELETONS
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (Louder)

Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uhh, yeah, higher)
It's like standing in the ocean
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her of half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic
Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
Standing in the ocean
Standing in the ocean
Echoing (Echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean (Oh baby)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed
