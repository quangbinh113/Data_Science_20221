Song Name: 247
Two-four-seven, this phone keep buzzin' (huh?)
Bitch, it's nothin' (yeah, it's nothin')
Bitch, it's nothin' (bitch, it's nothin')
Yeah, it's nothin' (nothing)
Two-four-seven, these racks keep comin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (yeah, it's nothin')
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh, bitch, it's nothin')
Yeah, it's nothin'
Two-four-seven, there's another nigga hating, it ain't no debating
My vision get clearer, them niggas keep fading, hol' up
Show you how we finna play it
I get me a bag, hit a foreign location
Where he at? Prolly bein' complacent
Where I'm at? Counting up in the basement
10 bands, 20 bands, 30 bands
Hunnid bands every other occasion, uh
My bitch need no beverage, uh
My dick got electrons, uh
Come over, give you a lesson
Corrupt for class presi' 'cause I'm always present
I-I do what I preach, I'm a certified reverend
They dance in they seats when they notice my presence
The real MVP was a lil' adolescent, got rich, and now
Two-four-seven, this phone keep buzzin' (huh?)
Bitch, it's nothin' (yeah, it's nothin')
Bitch, it's nothin' (bitch, it's nothin')
Yeah, it's nothin' (nothin')
Two-four-seven, these racks keep comin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (bitch, it's nothin')
Bitch, it's nothin' (yeah, it's nothin')
Yeah, it's nothin'
Two-four-seven, this phone keep buzzin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Yeah, it's nothin'
Two-four-seven, these racks keep comin'
Bitch, it's nothin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Yeah, it's nothin' (uh)
And they heard Mike known to get bodies at the door
For sure, I don't think a nigga ever could go broke
I'm on, put some, uh-uh, in my cup and watch a nigga get throat
Pay the price, get no advice from any nigga, I'm grown
Swipe the Visa, I won't trip about shit, I'ma leave ya (I'ma leave ya)
Tell me secrets, shawty a demon
She tryna get her some kids from my semen
I just went crazy, life hit a 180 (180)
From the shade, now everybody move shady
Lifestyle turned "Fuck you, pay me"
Wipe me down, lil' bitch, I'm lazy, sorry, lady
I'm focused, need promotion, she just a game, need a token (token)
She stroking on my, uh-uh, won't kiss and tell on some ho shit
The industry my bitch and they make me feel so important
They know I get shit lit, they on my phone, I had to tell 'em
This bitch is buzzin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Yeah, it's nothin'
Two-four-seven, these racks keep comin'
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Bitch, it's nothin' (uh)
Yeah, it's nothin'
