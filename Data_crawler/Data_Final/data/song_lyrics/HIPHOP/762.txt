Song Name: Rags2Riches 2 (feat. Lil Baby)
Ay, Zypitano got that gas
SIX G, yeah for real, for real

Uh, uh, let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh
We went from rags to riches
Project fences to livin' luxury
Now we live luxury
Straight out that bottom
Nobody gave nothing to me
Be careful while fucking with me
All of my lil' brothers 'bout it, they cutting for me
Yeah, they gon' cut you for me
Lay in the cut with them cutters and cut you for free
Say she in love with me
But save your love
I just want your company
I fall in the club for free
I give out daps and give them hugs
But no one's for me
'Cause that type of shit
Don't faze a player, uh
This type of shit
Is what make a hater
When you got it out the mud yeah, yeah
Ran it up, yeah
Really don't give no fuck, yeah
Don't give no fuck
When you turn nothing to something, yeah
Really hustling, yeah
Young and getting that money, yeah
We getting that money, yeah
Rags to riches

To riches
I went from rags to riches
I still go back to the trenches
We had to smash some nigga gas
No silver spoons, we had plastic utensils
He just came home, he still packing his pistol
Die in these streets or get saved by the system
Or get you some millions, my lifestyle is vicious
These hoes ain't gon' miss you
They fuck on your partner
Act like they forget you, that shit have you sick
My girl the realest, I know how to pick 'em
I know what I did, I need you to bear with me
I know shit get ugly, but that's why you are pretty
And pushing a Bentley, my kind near extinct
I put up the millions, I'll never go broke
I'm a god in my hood, I give everyone hope
Can't remember a time when my answer was nope
I remember the times I had nowhere to go
Down to my lowest, I turned to a pro
And I'm pouring my heart out, I bought my lil' boy house
I brought all the bros out, I never try to show out
I'm never gon' go out, never that
Every time that I turn around, I'm giving back
Once they whack him, he's dead, it ain't no getting back
I was giving my all, not asking for it back
I had blue hearts at first, I had to turn 'em back
Rags to riches
