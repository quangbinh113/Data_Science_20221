Song Name: Last Kiss Of Nebulon
We, we are done
Said it's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh
We, we are done
Said it's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh
You say it's over, it ain't over yet baby, uh
Didn't wanna go, and now I'm going, yeah, uh
Act like you know but didn't know me yet, baby, uh
This type of love is not fair, ooh
It's in my heart, it's in my head
And I just won't last
1-5-0 on the dash, heading nowhere fast
And I'm needing your love
I'm so deep in your love
Hoping that don't crash
Trying to speed to your love
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, like you did me
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah
You said you loved me, you don't love me, no, baby, uh
You know my limits, you gon' take it there
You got no shame, you know this world is so crazy, uh
That type of love is unfair
It's in my heart, it's in my head
And I just won't last
1-5-0 on the dash, heading nowhere fast
And I'm needing your love
I'm so deep in your love
Hoping that don't crash
Trying to speed to your love
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, like you did me
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah
We, we are done
Said it's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh
We, we are done
It's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, like you did me
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (ooh, gonna get you good)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (so, so, good)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (fire by the wood)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, like you did me
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah
