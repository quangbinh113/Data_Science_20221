Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Ain't no problem, I'ma give you your way
Got me intoxicated
I'ma give you your way
You should reach out and take it
And I'm getting impatient
You should reach out and take it
Give you your way
Body in motion (in motion, in motion)
You can have it your way
We've been fuckin' 'round for 48 months straight
I won't judge you if you let me hit it first base
Put you in positions I don't even much play
You get my attention, I'm real big on concentration
I won't tell no one, I ain't that into conversation
Keep you looking good, I do believe in presentation
Buy you sports cars if you can keep my mind racing
I'll never have you waiting
I'm getting off
I'ma charge it to my credit card and I'ma charge it to my heart
We can keep it in the dark, but if you want I'll show you off
You can get on top and ride me like a Harley
It don't matter as long as you take me there
Body in motion (body in motion)
Ooh, look, I got you focused, yeah (focused, yeah)
Body in motion
Uh, uh, keep that body in motion
Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Ain't no problem, I'ma give you your way
Got me intoxicated
I'ma give you your way
You should reach out and take it
And I'm getting impatient
You should reach out and take it
Give you your way
Body in motion
Dark lemonade got me ridin' 'round toxic
She give me neck like an ostrich in a lobster
She like how I stack the pancakes, like Betty Crocker
And I do the dash, she gon' suck me, I'ma crash
Took her on a vacay, brand-new Prada bag
I just wanna spoil you every day I can
You ain't gotta rap, I give you your advance
I bought her brand-new titties and bought her a brand-new ass
And I promised Webster I know you never go to Ross
You strategize, you're fly, you kill 'em all
I wanna get what I've been giving
I want a bitch that want a bitch that want a bitch
That's how I'm living, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Body in motion (body in motion)
Ooh, look, I got you focused, yeah (focused, yeah)
Body in motion
Uh, uh, keep that body in motion
Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Ain't no problem, I'ma give you your way
Got me intoxicated
I'ma give you your way
You should reach out and take it
And I'm getting impatient
You should reach out and take it
Give you your way
Body in motion
Suddenly, you came around and something came right over me (over me)
Honestly I'll tell you where I really wanna be (wanna be)
I brought her into the night, I need you here right under me
Girl, I'll keep you company, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Girl, you got a right, look in your eyes
It's like I could read your mind
And we've both been saying, "It's time you put it in reverse and ride"
Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Ain't no problem, I'ma give you your way
Got me intoxicated
I'ma give you your way
You should reach out and take it
And I'm getting impatient
You should reach out and take it
Give you your way
Body in motion (We The Best Music)
I'm so impatient, don't keep me waiting
I think I got it bad for you, baby, bad for you, baby
Intoxicated, I'm on but I'm faded
I think I got it bad for you, baby, bad for you, baby
Body in motion
You got me so damn focused, yeah
Baby, I'm so done with waiting
Baby, you're gorgeous
You're incredible
You're beautiful
You're phenomenal
You're amazing
Most importantly, you're a queen
