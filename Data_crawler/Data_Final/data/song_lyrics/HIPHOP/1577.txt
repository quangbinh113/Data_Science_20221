Song Name: Reset (with Bryson Tiller)
Can we just reset? (Reset)
Can we do it over from the start?
Ain't no need to be pressed (be pressed)
'Cause we in the same game playing our part
Need you to give me yo' best (yo' best)
I got lots of options that's still available to me
I'm not like the rest (no way)
I look at 'em like they on a lower level to me
Glitch in the matrix, I dodge all the hate coming at me (uh huh)
All of my budgets no limit, they never gon' cap me (no limit)
Every time I break your trust, I go to bed like, "Here we go again" (uuh)
Fuck all these hoes, make you number one and I get rid of all of them (fuck all)
I'm tryna hold it together, I don't wanna be apart (be apart)
Please tell me who you know better than me that gon' play my part (play my part)
You wondering why I be stressed, can't get back the time I invest (oh-oh)
Don't keep ignoring my message, girl, you just blocking your blessings (your blessings)
I got problems, my intention is never to break your heart (break your heart)
You should know how you should deal with me
When I show you all my cards (I show you everything)
I know you the girl of my dreams, I treat you like the queen, nothing less (queen)
Wish you had more faith in me, feel like you don't believe in me yet
Can we just reset? (Reset)
Can we do it over from the start?
Ain't no need to be pressed (be pressed)
'Cause we in the same game playing our part
Need you to give me yo' best (yo' best)
I got lots of options that's still available to me
I'm not like the rest (no way)
I look at 'em like they on a lower level to me
Oh, why?
Can we just reset?
Big shot glass, full of regret
A bitch walked past, should I? (Oh, yeah)
Bitch walked past, should I heat check?
Wear my heart on my sleeve, it's a defect
It's not what it seems, do I seem stressed?
You told me, "Yes" (oh, yeah)
I'm eager to reset and I'm
Thinking we need it, yes, and I'm
Taking a week just to be alone, wanna readjust
Turn you on, wanna heat it up
You really wanna believe in us
But you're still thinking about that time I (yes)
Never mind
Let's get it off your mind, off your mind (off)
Seem like it became part of your mind (yeah)
Leaving me stray, guess your heart isn't mine
Easy to say that you're guarded, but it's getting harder to climb
Felt the need to ask
Can we just reset? (Reset)
Can we do it over from the start?
Ain't no need to be pressed (be pressed)
'Cause we in the same game playing our part
Need you to give me yo' best (yo' best)
I got lots of options that's still available to me
I'm not like the rest (no way)
I look at 'em like they on a lower level to me (uh huh)
