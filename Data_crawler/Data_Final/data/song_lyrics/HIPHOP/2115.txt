Song Name: Gangsta Nation
Consider this an invitation
To my gangsta nation
Na-na, na-na-na-na (Westside)
Na-na, na-na-na-na (ooh-ooh)
Na-na, na-na-na-na (what? What)
Na-na, na-na-na-na (soowoop)
Na-na, na-na-na-na (yeah, yeah)
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what?
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they run and duck
We still right here, so what the fuck?
Nigga I'm tired of the niggas barkin' that shit, talkin' that shit
From the concrete but ain't chalkin' that shit
In videos in a bitch pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a Dub-S-C thang, W.C. brain
And we don't fuck with niggas in khaki g-strings
Fuck movin', I'm clearin the crowd
It's that hoo-bangin' bandana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the original
Evacuate the building, bitch, here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you playin' nigga this who bang
With enough game to drive a square bitch insane
And we number one gunners, no, we ain't stunners
It's real with us homey, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-bo in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than the motherfuckin' L.A. summer, let's go
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what?
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they run and duck
We still right here, so what the fuck?
What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin' about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy I ain't goin get
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyoncé, face like Andre (ugh)
Bitch you kinda strangé
But I'm rich, so my entré got to be Bombay
Have you seen us? Nah
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est, nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas, hypnotic by the liters
With a flank of hoes on us 'cause our chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bangin' for the whole G Nation, nigga
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what?
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they run and duck
We still right here, so what the fuck?
It's a Gangsta Nation, if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the C
Now, tell the truth rappers, you don't ball like me
'Cause I'm really from the gang, y'all is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and cluckas
Bangin' for the hood causin' havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label kissin' ass like suckas
And you're bitches, so sit down when you piss motherfuckers
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big Bruno, rap sumo, on pruno (You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
And my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a stick pussy, nigga you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
'Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it
Look here man
Check this shit out man, look
Y'all might as well say, "Fuck it" and join this Westside thing man
'Cause we got a motherfuckin' gangsta nation goin' over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motherfuckin' be
Believe that homie
Look, it ain't a hit 'til Nate Dogg spit
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what?
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they run and duck
We still right here, so what the fuck?
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na (consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation)
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Bitch, you know the side, world motherfucking wide
So what you saying? (What you saying is you-)
Man, what you say, you need to get the fuck out of my business nigga
That's what you need to do
'Cause I'm getting tired of you keep telling what the fuck I'm doing
Every time I'm doing something
'Cause I'm not finna fake for these peckerwoods
Get outta my business, okay?
Okay? Get out my business man
