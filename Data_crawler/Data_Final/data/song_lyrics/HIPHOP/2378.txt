Song Name: jaded
I been trying hard, you've been laying low
I've been moving mountains pushing through the snow
I can't feel my fingers, I can't feel my toes
Love won't be my savior, I should let it go
She's got these eyes, jaded, she's a gem
I may fall in love, I might break my heart again
Love it when she laughs, fuck, I love it when she breaths
I get dizzy when she speaks 'cause she's exactly what I need
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine
I think it might be best for me to let you go
But if you ever love me you should let me know
I know you really want him, guess I'm fine with that
Be careful with your heart 'cause I'm not good at that
Picking up the pieces
Does he hold you while you're sleeping?
Heard he loves you? Does he mean it?
Does he care about your dreams and
All your goals and how you'll meet him
Does he call you every evening?
Is he making sure you're eating?
Do you love him how he loves you? Is he even fucking even?
I won't wait around for him to break your heart
I can't mend your soul I don't know where I'd start
I don't wanna fight again, I know it gets hard
I don't wanna fight again, I know it gets hard
I been trying hard, you've been laying low
I've been moving mountains pushing through the snow
I can't feel my fingers, I can't feel my toes
Love won't be my savior, I should let it go
She's got these eyes, jaded, she's a gem
I might fall in love, I might break my heart again
Love it when she laughs, fuck, I love it when she breaths
I get dizzy when she speaks 'cause she's exactly what I need
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine
