Song Name: Patience (feat. YUNGBLUD & Polo G)
Little bit, little bit, little bit
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes
Uh, uh
No patience, I've had enough
Spent too much time through these phases, it's just not addin' up
Felt all alone on those stages, wanna get my passion up
It's over, pack it up, don't walk away from me
When the night falls, make the right call
Or she'll be gone forever
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (ayy)
And my heart won't change
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes (oh)
Need a little space to slow the brain
I don't really wanna feel the pain
Seen a lot of shit to make me hate
I don't wanna hide until it's too late
Feels like I'm gonna break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (ayy)
And my heart won't change (ch-ch-ch-change)
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes (oh)
Bridges burnin', I won't let you get to me
Tables turnin', I don't need bad energy
Now I'm learnin', lyin' 'bout our chemistry
No returnin', I-
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (ayy)
And my heart won't change (ch-ch-ch-change)
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes (oh)
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we been goin' through changes
