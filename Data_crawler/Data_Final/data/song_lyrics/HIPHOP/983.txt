Song Name: MEGAN
Ayy, no she won't
No she won't understand what I be saying
She wanna fuck with me, but I wanna fuck with Megan
I hit her on the phone and she not fucking taken
Ain't about the money then no conversations
No conversations bitch no complications
Fuck you bitch you took my heart now it's breakin'
You want me back now cause your feeling shameless
I used to know that bitch but now she is nameless
Ay I don't wanna know that bitch
I don't need to know that bitch
20 times 2 bitch
Eat his fucking 40 clip
Like a Beyblade you know a niggas gonna have a rip
Uzi mac 11's put a pussy nigga down
Aye, I just came up in this bitch
Caught a whole town
Only king in this bitch, I wear the crown (Aye)
I'm the sun in the sky, bitch i gotta shine
I already made my mind got no time
None of this in the fucking front house
Megan, Megan, open up the door now
I pray that bitch open just don't kick me out (Haha)
Let me explain just what this is about
Aye, yo, I don't wanna be with you no more
And I don't even think you understand me huh
You really don't (Fuck)
No she won't
No she won't understand what I be saying
She wanna fuck with me, but I wanna fuck with Megan
I hit her on the phone and she not fucking taken
Ain't about the money then no conversations
No conversations bitch no complications
Fuck you bitch you took my heart now it's breakin'
You want me back now cause your feeling shameless
I used to know that bitch but now she is nameless
No she won't
No she won't understand what I be saying
She wanna fuck with me, but i wanna fuck with Megan
I hit her on the phone and she not fucking taken
Ain't about the money then no conversations
No conversations bitch no complications
Fuck you bitch you took my heart now it's breakin'
You want me back now cause your feeling shameless
I used to
