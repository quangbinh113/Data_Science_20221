She just be runnin' off
They runnin' off with the sauce
Eatin' too much, my niggas, they nauseous
Got that bag and I don't give a fuck
All a sudden, she fuckin' with us
On my dick, she ain't makin' me bust
Not gon' lie, yeah, that bitch is my crush
And I know that she like the vibe, yeah
Not gon' lie, yeah, that bitch is my crush

If I ain't makin' this heat, then lil' nigga, I'm makin' designs, yeah, uh
She like, "Baby, I like your personality, let me ask, what's your sign?" Yeah, uh
And I know she see the certain qualities, she like, "Wish they was mine," yeah, uh
She wanna party, ooh, party

She goin' wild 'til she see the sun
She goin' dumb, yeah, go retarded
I'm throwin' them ones, she don't give a fuck
'Cause she wanna party, party off molly
She wanna party, party off molly
She from the hood, know it that she wildin'
You got no money but you got some diamonds
I get this bag and I got a lot of it
Niggas, they talkin', I ain't with the politics
Nigga, you mad, you irrelevant
I might pull up to the scene with a different chick
I'm fuckin' this ho, she a friend with benefits
If it's 'bout the bread, I'm in attendance
Maybe that's the reason I am so friend-less
And she turned to that bitch when she met me
I might skrrt off, I hop in that Bentley
She wanna blow me up, yeah
She wanna pour me up, yeah
She wanna show me up, yeah
She wanna show me love
She wanna blow me up, yeah
She wanna pour me up, yeah
She wanna show me up, yeah
She wanna show me love
She wanna blow me up, yeah
She wanna pour me up, yeah
She wanna show me up, yeah
She wanna show me love
She wanna blow me up, yeah
She wanna pour me up-
