Song Name: Really Redd (feat. Trippie Redd, Lil Keed, Young Nudy)
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid
They try to keep up, but they can never hang
They say they with us, but they ain't really gang
They say they real ride, but they ain't never bang
They say they whip white, but they ain't never slang
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
Got a whole lotta red
Got a whole lotta, whole lotta hoes in my bed
Got a whole lotta fours in my cup, sip 'til I'm dead
Got a whole lotta, whole lotta bros in the feds
Got a whole lotta, whole lotta shit in my head
Shit, wish it would get out
Told her grab her shit, bitch, get out
Told 'em pass the torch, it's time to sit down
Fuck it, grab the K, e'rybody get down
They try to keep up, but they can never hang
They say they with us, but they ain't really gang
They say they real ride, but they ain't never bang
They say they whip white, but they ain't never slang
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
Niggas banging this shit
But they ain't really red (they ain't really)
They ain't really red, bitch (they ain't really)
They ain't really red (Keed talk to 'em)
All these niggas getting caught in these deals
They ain't red (all these, all these niggas)
Yeah, that bitch pussy paint my drop-top red (pussy)
Wish a pussy nigga ever say that I ain't led (pussy)
To the drop-top, to the private jet
To the mansion, to the bad bitch (let's go, let's get it)
But I know my partner gone
Ain't snitchin' though, he a savage (let's go, let's get it)
All my four pockets full, got a fifth pocket on cabbage (yeah)
All eyes, doin' five runts for a drive by in that Caddy
Yeah, yeah, tryna keep up, but they know I ain't hit it (yeah)
They try to keep up, but they can never hang (Keed, slime ball)
They say they with us
But they ain't really gang (yeah, slime, slime pole)
They say they real ride, but they ain't never bang
They say they whip white, but they ain't never slang (let's go)
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
My shoes, yeah, they red bottoms (red bottoms)
The beam on your head comin' from my choppa (from my choppa)
Niggas steppin' over bodies, make 'em red bottom (yeah)
If I wanna forget about that body, call your bitch up (yeah)
She's a head doctor, suck me up with no problem
As I sip this red up out my cup and this bitch got me rock hard
Everything she think about the slime, she like, "Oh my God"
Shawty, it's the hardest of the hardest, man, I swear to God
They try to keep up, but they can never hang
They say they with us, but they ain't really gang
They say they real ride, but they ain't never bang
They say they whip white, but they ain't never slang
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
Niggas banging this shit, but they ain't really red
They ain't really red, bitch, they ain't really red
