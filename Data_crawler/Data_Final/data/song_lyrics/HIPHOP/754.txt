(One nigga will change the world)
No, no, no (Gon' change the world, baby)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Gon' change the world, baby)
No, no, no (Young nigga world, baby)
Now and then, niggas change on the game
Switch lanes, then come and try to hang with us
Nigga ain't really with that shit
On that snake shit, fake ass nigga that ain't wassup
Pussy nigga shit, that ain't wassup (Gon' change the world, baby)
Oh (Young nigga world, baby)
Now and then, niggas change for the fame
Niggas switch on the game, then come try to hang with us
You was just rich two years ago
Now the nigga in the middle of the road on angel dust
We ain't had shit, we was on our dick
And those hoes ain't even really wanna hang with us
Niggas switch some snake shit, fake shit
Hell nah, pussy ass nigga, that ain't wassup
Nigga fuckin' with the crusade, really with the shit
Hell nah, we a clique full of murderers
Don't touch my nigga, my nigga really creep
They slime, and they will murder ya'
Niggas said that he body-bagging, toe-tagging,
Shit fuck nigga, but we ain't ever heard of ya'
You can keep all the store to yourself, fuck nigga
You ain't on that shit, we never heard of ya'
Pussy jit, we ain't heard of ya'
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
Clique full of murderers, fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
I got a new bitch for the summer
They wait for the bus, then they throw me right under
My watch and baguettes, I don't know what's exactly the price
But it cost me way over a hunnid
Bro had the drink, and I thought it was soda
I sipped it and felt like I was in a coma
I'm covered in water, I need me a floater
She suckin' my dick and I don't even know
All my, guys right
You fight, I fight
I'm fly, you're fly
My guys, my guys
My guys, fight if I fight
Kill, stab, die, die
I try too many times
I cry too many times
Nigga watch who you play with (Stop playin')
Before I catch a pre-meditated (Bwaa)
Gotta a lotta niggas dead and I still see their faces (Woo)
I'm a rap star, could've been a mental patient (Hit it)
Hit you with the bag, you still ain't pay me (What)
You must want a nigga come and do you like a stranger
I ain't even trippin', money older than a pager
Niggas see you shine, then forget you really dangerous
They won't let you help him (They won't let you help him)
They gon' make you nail him (Fuck, you gon' kill him)
My nigga got life, he call every day
I don't know what to tell him (I can't help my nigga)
We gon' get more time than murder,
They catch us with this shit we sellin' (We gotta be level)
Y'all were from high school to college
We were from babies to felons, nigga (That's on my momma)
I done really survived everything
These streets offered (Get on that shit)
I been through the mud (Bah), almost gave up (Bah)
I done really survived everything
These streets offered (Get on that shit)
I been caged up (Hit it), I done dodged those slugs (Hit it, aye)
I got a nine hour, I got a nine hour
I got a nine hour flight
I got a nine hour, I got a nine hour
I got a nine hour flight
Load up the cave, load up the carbon
This shit is off the dome
D caught a body, Trell caught a body
My niggas ain't comin' home
I know that lil' Trell comin' home
But they give lil' D fifty years
His momma keep cryin' them tears (Start cryin' on me)
His momma keep cryin' them tears (Start cryin', ah)
It's a draco in the back off the car
And the police here behind ya
Better do what you do, better run, or
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Boy, you better run
Lil Melly comin' for ya'
And he strapped up with the gun
Y'all had a condo in your circle, and you don't even know
They tryna snake ya, take your money, but they claim that you're broke
And where was she when a young nigga was so damn broke
And where was she when a nigga ain't have no hope (Huh)
Dirty mattress (Yeah, slatt, slatt)
Man these pussy niggas actin' (Huh)
Hell nah, ain't no rackin'
Big D, double O, twenty babbel was brackin'
Fuck boy get actin'
Pick him up like some motherfuckin' laundry
Nigga play, hell nah, Armani's
These hoes gon' fuck up our lease
Balenciaga's
Saint Laurent's
This bitch wanna fuck
She rollin' my blunts
I don't even smoke
You like to toke
We totin' the Tommy Gun
Got free smoke for anyone
Now and then, niggas change for the fame
Niggas switch on the game, then come try to hang with us
You was just rich two years ago
Now the nigga in the middle of the road on angel dust
We ain't had shit, we was on our dick
And those hoes ain't even really wanna hang with us
Niggas switch some snake shit, fake shit
Hell nah, pussy ass nigga, that ain't wassup
Nigga fuckin' with the crusade, really with the shit
Hell nah, we a clique full of murderers
Don't touch my nigga, my nigga really creep
They slime, and they will murder ya'
Niggas said that he body-bagging, toe-tagging,
Shit fuck nigga, but we ain't ever heard of ya'
You can keep all the store to yourself, fuck nigga
You ain't on that shit
We never heard of ya' (Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)
Pussy jit, we ain't heard of ya'
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
Clique full of murderers, fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya'
