Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mike WiLL Made-It
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mally Mall
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ear Drummers
Yeah, hoe
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was sliding in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up
Coming out her clothes
I'm in wonderland when she coming down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
Diamonds unthawed
Comin' in froze (Froze)
Got too many girls to let one of them go (Oh)
When I make a purchase, I can't wait to showboat (Oh)
If she bad, I put a pinky ring on snow globe
I'ma have that pussy on lock like po-po (Yeah)
She was goin' up and down like yo-yo (Down)
You can say I'm greedy 'cause I always want more (More)
I don't fuck with holmes 'cause they with some slow-pokes (Lame)
Ooh, money on monsoon (Ooh)
Baby girl full moon (Ayy)
Give theses niggas with some money some room
She don't she stop, batteries not included (Go)
Oh, big ballin' like Mutombo, yeah
Much cooler than the cool kids, woah
Can you believe every night we do this? (Do this, yeah)
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was sliding in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up
Comin' out her clothes
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
Hold up, I'ma go and spend that money soon (Hol' up)
I don't care if she had a man, so? (Man?)
Pedicure gang, get your fingernails did
With no shame, flips that ass like heads or tails (Tails)
And she finer than a motherlover (Lover)
Can I hit that ass like a bullseye? (Hit)
She gon' suck like a bloodsucker (Woo)
My fee higher than a motherfucker
Oh, I hear you like fast cash (Fast cash)
Baby, you know I got the hots for you (I've got the hots)
I'm been workin', so I cash in
She said, I only wanna dance for you (Dance)
We have no mercy for you, no (No)
Me and my niggas closer than in-laws (Than in-laws)
Fuck an interview she know the answer (Answer)
Prototype cars not a Jaguar (Skrrt)
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up
Comin' out her clothes
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
Duck sauce on my feet, hoe
Pass around the pre-rolls
Rollie on my chain
Flavor Flav with the steez, hoe
Kush residue on my jeans
I blow hella dope
And them classic Reeboks
Whiter than snow
And a nigga be dressin'
Walkin' 'round, Gucci steppin'
Unintentional flexin'
Tryna send out a message
Money walk with the extra
Shake that ass wit' ya bestie
Seein' stars in the rental
Got your broad in the rental?
20k in AOD
And it's just me and my kinfolk?
Tryna send a girl to college
I ain't copping no free show?
Say her birthday late July
Yeah, that means she a Leo?
Might just leave with me tonight
But that don't mean she a freak hoe
Fuck with dancers and models
Shout out them girls who get dollars
Shawty came from the bottom
Yeah, shout out Keisha bottoms
Couple cases of Rosé
Came out to me with the Sparkles
I pour up for all the girls
But I'ma drink out the bottles
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up
Comin' out her clothes
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
She got that million dollar pussy
But I get it for the free
She like to do a lot of snow
I told that bitch to come and ski
Shawty bad, she can get it
She can swallow, she can spit it
Bring her friend, if she with it
On the pole, y'all can split it
In the bed or the Lamb' (Or the Lamb)
Got your bitch suckin' dick on the 'Gram (On the 'Gram)
V12 helped me get up out the jam (Out the jam)
Trunk full of slam
R.I.P Lil Peep, I gotta slow down on them Xans (Hey)
Just had a ménage (Hey)
Back seat of my Benz (Hey)
Put that shit on camera (Hey)
She squirted on the lens (Hey)
Then she told me put it on her chinny chin-chin (Hey)
Pocket full of nothin' but them Benjy Franklins (Hey)
In the game posted up (Up)
Puttin' numbers up (Up)
Bitch, run me the check first
I don't wanna fuck (Yeah)
They say it's cuffin' season
Baby, you ain't good enough (Nope)
She want a real nigga
Dog, you ain't hood enough
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up
Comin' out her clothes
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pol
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
