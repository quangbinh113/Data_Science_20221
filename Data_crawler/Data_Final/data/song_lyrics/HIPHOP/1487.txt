Huh, roll another one
Said I'm never lackin', always pistol packing
With them automatics, we gon' send him to heaven
Wait, wait, wait, wait, ayy, ayy, woo (aw, shit), huh?
Oh, you feelin' sturdy, huh? (You feelin' sturdy, man)
Let me see somethin'
Shake it, shake it, shake it
She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga
(She let it clap for a nigga)
And she throw it back for a nigga
(Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga)
Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, uh
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr
Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, uh
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr
When I walk in the spot, 30 on me
Buy out the club, niggas know that I'm paid
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit
I can't fuck with these niggas 'cause niggas is gay
All on my page suckin' dick
All in my comments and screamin' my name
While I'm in the club, throwin' them 100s, and 50s, and ones, and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail (woo)
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine
Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT (baow)
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it
I bet I air it like BNB
Nappy Blue wildin' in my section
And I keep that .38 for the weapon
Remember when I came home from corrections (uh-huh)
All the bad bitches in my direction (uh)
She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga
(She let it clap for a nigga)
And she throw it back for a nigga
(Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga)
Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, uh
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr
Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, uh
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr
