Song Name: BOGUS
Yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy
I don't go for no type of bogus shit (ah)
She just wanna take a picture (ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole again, woah (oh)
Yo, double deck of hoes in it
They know I'm for sure, they knock on my door with it
Donny on a roll, couple bowls, I'm gone, get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I popped the door with it, yeah (oo-oo, yeah)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
It's another day, on another plane, on another flight (uh-uh)
The pour up, need the door open, I'm going tonight (yeah-yeah)
And I tried to fall in love, but you wouldn't see me right
Wouldn't see me right (see me right)
Speed off in a Lambo, you hear the pipes buss
I just wanna hit it here for one night 'cause
Going off with little shawty like a robbery, woah
Order waste my time, you ain't got time for me, woah
Two tone Patek
Two tone at your neck (ah, haha)
Know I need respect (woah)
Know I need respect (woah)
You know I need my money, a hunnid thousand checks (uh-uh)
But my cars always dollars, I run straight to the jects
I might've flowed a hun', blow that back, and blow that hun
By the time my fit is on, cross the line, no border, huh
I gotta go fill me up (fill me up)
Fill me up (fill me up)
Border
I don't go for no type of bogus shit (ah)
She just wanna take a picture (ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole again (woah)
Yo, double deck of hoes in it
They know I'm for sure, they knock on my door with it
Donny on a roll, couple bowls, I'm gone, get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I popped the door with it, yeah (oo-oo, yeah)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
