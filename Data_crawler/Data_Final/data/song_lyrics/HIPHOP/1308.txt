Song Name: Euphoric
Chill Basel, chill
Go
Hmm, hmm, hmm (go)
In a bulletproof black Tahoe
We gon' box 'em up, wholesale like it's Costco
Dash like I'm Roscoe
Fuckin' on your ho, we the Bang Bros (woo)
This a Glock, we don't even name bro, we is not the same bro (huh)
Open up your eyes, let 'em inside, even in the night, see the angels cry
Oh-oh-oh (what did you say to me?)
She said that, "I'm proud of you", I don't wanna lie to you
Calling out your name when I'm down
Blow 'em out the brain, show 'em no mercy when all you know is pain
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (b-b-b-boom)
We drop them down, put you in the field (go)
Like a Navy SEAL, I'm going straight for the kill
Fighting all my demons in a past life, this gon' be the last time
Told my shorty, "I just wanna die" (fuck)
Toe tag, body bag, you pay the price (sit up)
Give a fuck what a nigga say, they gon' die (fuck)
Got the choppas, we gon' put you down, take your life (huh)
What your problem is? I'll put you on the list alright (fuck)
I'll roll you like a fuckin' blunt and smoke you, now I'm high (now I'm high)
Looking at a mirror like, "Fuck, who am I?" (Who that nigga?)
Fuckin' on your bitch, she love it when she taking pipe (huh)
Love a mean bitch 'cause that pussy too nice
Toe tag, body bag, you pay the price (go)
Give a fuck what a nigga say, they gon' die (b-b-b-boom)
Hmm-hmm, hmm (give a fuck what a nigga say, they gon' die)

In a bulletproof black Tahoe
We gon' box 'em up, wholesale like it's Costco
Dash like I'm Roscoe
Fuckin' on your ho, we the Bang Bros (woo)
This a Glock, we don't even name bro, we is not the same bro (huh)
Open up your eyes, let 'em inside, even in the night, see the angels cry
Oh-oh-oh (what did you say to me?)
Hmm, hmm, hmm (go)
In a bulletproof black Tahoe
We gon' box 'em up, wholesale like it's Costco
Dash like I'm Roscoe
Fuckin' on your ho, we the Bang Bros (woo)
This a Glock, we don't even name bro, we is not the same bro (huh)
Open up your eyes, let 'em inside, even in the night, see the angels cry
Oh-oh-oh
