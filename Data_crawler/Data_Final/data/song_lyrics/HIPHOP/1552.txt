Song Name: Big Stunna (feat. Birdman)
But the shots can't miss
(It's Budda Beats)
But the shots can't miss (Blatt)
(DJ Durel)
But the shots can't miss
You slip, we slide
But the shots can't miss, yeah, huh
Big stunna (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Big stunna (Stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt)
But the shots can't miss (Stunt, Huncho)
Real nigga, I can't fuck with you, nigga
I can't hang, ain't no snakes in none of my campaign, nigga
I'm gon' pop it, like a fucking bottle of champagne, nigga
Call the rocket, we gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga
(Gone, Takeoff)
Phew, phew, phew, phew
We gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga
Phew, ha, ha, ha
Call the rocket, we gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga (Ha)
Been in all corners, I ain't never been a runner
Fifty rounds on a drummer (Oh), made 'em add another comma
I ain't going for finesse, if they try me, I'ma buss' 'em
In that demon, I possess, but watch me snatch that motherfucker
(Skrrt)
Big Huncho, big stunna (Big), bad bitch, that's big momma
(Momma)
Big jewelry, big money, big guns, come take something (Brrt)
Walk inside the room, I'm the biggest buck, I am Giannis
Told my bitch I fucked another bitch, at least I am honest (Stunt)
Big stunna (Stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt, big, stunt)
Big stunna (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But the shots can't miss (Ayy)
Yeah, real nigga, I can't fuck with you, nigga (No)
I can't hang, ain't no snakes in none of my campaign, nigga
I'm gon' pop it, like a fucking bottle of champagne, nigga
Call the rocket, we gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga
(Phew, phew, phew)
Platinum Rollie, guacamole, holy moly
Coupe so fast, hocus pocus
Make a nigga lose focus
Diamonds flashin' off the lights
Bet your bitch gon' bust it open (Bust it)
See these chains and these rings, these are hood nigga trophies
(Trophies)
Get to swerving in that Lamb' with the doors wide open (Wide)
They can't put me under in this shit, way far from over (Nah)
Two cup styrofoam, don't worry 'bout what's in my soda (Fuck up)
Name a nigga colder, met the plug in North Dakota (Shh)
She look like, "Who whip this is?" I said, "Bitch, I'm the owner" (Me)
I was sick before corona, ice cold like pneumonia (Ice)
It may not look like it but I know he got it on him
(Shh, can't say that)
Lookin' at commas (Commas)
Might go get that OG Hummer for the summer
(Hummer, summer, fuck it)
Oxxxymiron
Big stunna (Stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt)
(The biggest baller in the business)
Big stunna (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But the shots can't miss (Ayy)
Bird and Wayne, Steph and Klay, Take' and Qua' (Take' and Qua')
Five star, Bugatti car, the stunna way (The stunna way)
Hella choppers, chrome blade, the candy paint (The candy paint)
Three hundred mill', Cash Money, Rich Gang (We rich, gang)
Lead actress? Bitch, please
You know who I be (Rich Gang)
Lead actress? Bitch, please
You know who I be (Rich Gang)
Yeah, big stunna
(Stunt, stunt, stunt, the biggest baller in the business, stunt, big)
Big stunna (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But the shots can't miss (Ayy)
Yeah, real nigga, I can't fuck with you, nigga (No)
I can't hang, ain't no snakes in none of my campaign, nigga
I'm gon' pop it, like a fucking bottle of champagne, nigga
Call the rocket, we gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga
(Gone, Takeoff)
Phew, phew, phew, phew
We gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga
(Phew, let's get it, ha, ha, ha)
Call the rocket, we gon' takeoff on the fuckin' stage, nigga (Ha)
