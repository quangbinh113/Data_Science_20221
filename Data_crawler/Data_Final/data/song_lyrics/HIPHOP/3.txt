Song Name: Disrespectful
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Get the fuck outta my face
I'm posted with my clique
We ain't never flinch
Credit card work the wrist
Lebron with the chip
All this sauce made us slip
When I walk I trip
We don't care that you rich
You corny little bitch
I started all the vibes
Started all the waves
Could've made it to my country
Took it to the States
I'm feeling like I'm Ace
Giving all the fades
Hit and run
They starving taking pics of my plates
Movin' it quick
Tryna get rich and dodgin' these dicks
Got head in the Uber then call me a Lyft
She pissed but what it is what it is what it is
Girl I'm stuck up in my ways yeah, my ways yeah
You can call me when you naked, you naked
Excuse me
Respect a motherfucker sayin' (get it)
Bottle service cuz you know we love to flex (hey)
Money double up when I fuck a check
Bitch I got now, fuck who got next
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Get the fuck outta my face
Thank God I don't ever gotta beg or borrow
I'm stuffing up that mattress 'case I fall tomorrow
Know now my whole squad really got me
Know the difference with who's down and who's around me
It it is what it is
Packing these ships got my momma a crib
Doing this shit cause you know that it's lit
Got the baddest bitches all on my dick
Copped me a whip (skrrt)
Copped me a whip (skrrt)
Bitch I'm different
Too consistent
All my ex-es talking crazy
Maybe tripping
Hit my phone right before the show
Ask the tickets
Bitch you should know this shit sold out
Why you visit?
Come and see me in the back
Freaks show me love
Girl you know that you a dub
Met her ass up in the club
Hate it when I throw them ones
But she know that I am the one
I'm up before the sun for my future sons
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Get the fuck outta my face
