Song Name: Purple (feat. Polo G & Deno)

If we see an opp, knock his thoughts out his head
Nigga, that's a no-brainer
To his hood he a legend, he a son or brother
To the streets, he was just a gang banger
I'm a 1300-block, Gucci ganger
Young nigga with a whole lot of anger
I was on the strip takin' risks everyday
My life in danger
We was playin' Russian roulette on that corner
You might feel the last shot in the chamber
Heat it up, we at war with our neighbours
Whole lot of close friends turned to strangers
Poppin' percs and it's lean in my cup
I was servin' all the fiends in the clubs
One night I had a dream we was up
Got away, like, I seen this enough
We from the ends where the whole
Side's danger (where the whole side's danger)
Where the closest ones turned into strangers (for that paper)
I was in the back, hit it from the front
Never had P, we had to hunt
Try not to lack, we coming up
Remember them days when the P's weren't enough, nah
And nearly had my G's locked up
Life is a mess, no peace for us
Most of us already went to school
But chasin' the bag is what I'm teachin' us
Everyday, yeah, I need that guap'
Cleanin' up so we need that mop
I got guys who can make it pop
Handle it when they see them opps
If we see an opp, knock his thoughts out his head
Nigga, that's a no-brainer
To his hood he a legend, he a son or brother
To the streets, he was just a gang banger
I'm a 1300-block, Gucci ganger
Young nigga with a whole lot of anger
I was on the strip takin' risks everyday
My life in danger
We was playin' Russian roulette on that corner
You might feel the last shot in the chamber
Heat it up, we at war with our neighbours
Whole lot of close friend turned to strangers
Poppin' percs and it's lean in my cup
I was servin' all the fiends in the clubs
One night I had a dream we was up
Got away, like, I seen this enough
Please, I don't need none of you G's
I'm tryna grab all the keys
I don't like no one 'cause this peak
Love to just talk all the time
Everyone bellin' my line
Have to just click on "Decline"
Have to just click on "Decline"
Nigga, you don't know me
I was still working hard through the storm
Shoutout to Polo G
I'm a young boy but a big boy earner
I know niggas who be holdin', shh
Gone far, but we goin' further
I got gas for the bunsen burner
If we see an opp, knock his thoughts out his head
Nigga, that's a no-brainer
To his hood he a legend, he a son or brother
To the streets, he was just a gang banger
I'm a 1300-block, Gucci ganger
Young nigga with a whole lot of anger
I was on the strip takin' risks everyday
My life in danger
We was playin' Russian roulette on that corner
You might feel the last shot in the chamber
Heat it up, we at war with our neighbours
Whole lot of close friend turned to strangers
Poppin' percs and it's lean in my cup
I was servin' all the fiends in the clubs
One night I had a dream we was up
Got away, like, I seen this enough
