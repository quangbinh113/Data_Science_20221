Song Name: Gang Gang (feat. JAY1 & Deno)
Bad bad
Back of them jeans, looking mad mad
Open the Jeep, let me grab grab
Roll with the G's, that's the gang
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Someone told me she's a liar
Never gonna cap, I need a rider
Told you "Don't play with fire"
Gang gang, stop playing with the gang gang
Come every year like Mariah (hmm)
Five figure drip when I show the attire
No stress, I'm in control like I'm Isco
Won't be no dancing if man let the diss go
Trust me, it's long when they aim at me (jeez)
Same chain, but it ain't the same as me (nah)
Thinking you're king, I'll dismantle the thronе that you're on
Leave you thеre looking like Kong (hahaha)
But I ain't on a funny man ting
I just stack mills, kick back, money man ting
Half a billy when they stream my ting
Lights blinding when they pree my ring
Bad bad
Back of them jeans, looking mad mad (jeans)
Open the Jeep, let me grab grab (Jeep)
Roll with the G's, that's the gang (G's)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Someone told me she's a liar (liar)
Never gonna cap, I need a rider (rider)
Told you "Don't play with fire" (fire)
Gang gang, stop playing with the gang gang
Big jacket, my G savage, he been active
JAY poppin', I stay guappin', there's no slackin' (nope)
Stay rapping, I live lavish, I got fashion (flash)
That girl's got a big back of the cheeks clappin'
The way she's throwing it back
All the baddies wanna link me
Nah, I'm clocking the cash
I just pulled up in a mazza, now she's flashing her racks
And I've just got a couple bookers, man pull up with the gang
We get turnt up (turnt)
Told the baddie in the room to come twerk up (twerk)
Told my nigga come we bill it and burn up (burn)
Big money in the bank, 'cah I'm a earner
Wave, I'm a surfer
Bang
Bad bad
Back of them jeans, looking mad mad (jeans)
Open the Jeep, let me grab grab (Jeep)
Roll with the G's, that's the gang (G's)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Someone told me she's a liar (liar)
Never gonna cap, I need a rider (rider)
Told you "Don't play with fire" (fire)
Gang gang, stop playing with the gang gang
Stop playing with the gang gang, yeah
Stop playing with the gang gang, yeah
Stop playing with the gang
Stop playing with the gang
Stop playing with the gang gang, yeah
Bop, bop, bop with the gang gang, yeah
Might roll with the gang gang, yeah
Stop playing with the gang
Stop playing with the gang
Stop playing with the gang gang, yeah
