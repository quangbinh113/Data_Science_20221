Song Name: Madness
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (nah)
I'm the man when I'm in it (mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished
Don't piss me off
I've been killin' this shit
Acting tough on the net with their feminine clits
Bitch, you're gonna get hit
And I've done more than the most in a single year
And still I'm the YouTube Don
I got clowned for the way that I was on the net
And still I'm the man that won
Now they're chasing me, chasing the hype
Wanting me, wanting the life
Loving me, loving the type
So I gave her pipe
Taking advantage, more venom in than carnage
A lot of choice like I'm Target
Only one in my market
Want a piece and I'll charge it
I'm at a point where I buy shit now just to rap about it
Post anything and they speak about it
Type anything and they tweet about it
Do anything and they meme about it
Only man with a life like me
Still unleashing with the jet like Li
Still achieving all the goals round me
Pick of the bunch and I'm still O.P
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (nahh)
I'm the man when I'm in it (mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished
But I'm not finished
I've been sick for the longest time
And I'm still on top, so I'm the illest
I've gone clear with the strongest power
Of my own OC so I'm the realest
Bring that heat with the hiss of the human torch
So the team know that I am the littest
Saying I need a feature, now they feature me
Never charting now it's easily
Back the beef and now I drink the tea
Six figures now it's for the fee
Up the levels from a Lamborghini
Bringing wishes 'cause the man a genie
Everything I touch, a mazaline
Still, you wonder why they wanna be me
Big boy tings, everything I spit is facts
End of the moment, but mans gonna come back like a Tekken Jet
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit (Jesus Christ)
Madness, no doubt when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (nah)
I'm the man when I'm in it (mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished
