Song Name: So Stressed (feat. Yung LB)
Yeah, uh, uh
Wipe the tears from your eyes, I know you stressin' (stressin')
Wipe the tears from your eyes, girl, you a blessin' (you a blessin')
Me and you got some identical gestures (uh)
Me and you gon' survive all of 'em weapons (we gon' survive)
I swear, me and you can do anything (ah)
Me and you and Hennessy (ah)
Me and you is the remedy of love (ah)
Yeah, baby, tell me what it is and what it fuckin' ain't (ah)
I just bought a condo overseas to get the fuck away (ah)
Dolce Gabbana, dollars and weed, I'm smokin' Runtz today (yeah)
Got the Fendi and Prada, got what you need
Let's touch the sun today (got what you need)
I know you so over this quarantine, let's go have fun today (go have fun)
Me and you have plans, let's get 'em done today (done)
Oh, man, goddamn, can't throw your love away (love)
'Cause I was taught to love away
Flood my soul, I love the drank
Hurt to the bone, I love the pain
Used to the cold, I love the rain
Stick to the code despite the pain
See UFO's in the sky today
If you could see the shit in my mind, you would feel all type of ways
Type of shit take the shine away
Type of shit make you cry today
Wipe the tears from your eyes, I know you stressin' (stressin')
Wipe the tears from your eyes, girl, you a blessin' (you a blessin')
Me and you got some identical gestures (uh)
Me and you gon' survive all of 'em weapons (we gon' survive)
I swear, me and you can do anything (ah)
Me and you and Hennessy (ah)
Me and you is the remedy of love (ah)
You heard? I ain't the type to stress her
Hit and left bands and strap on your dresser
Got your pussy all wet, gettin' necked down (huh)
Touched down in the six smokin cigs
Breakfast in bed, get the bowl of the grits
Put glass on your neck like your head got big
Come fly with the kid, yeah, my life is a trip
Take one way, we don't do round-trips (hell nah)
Bad bitch, Fendi with the Jimmy Choos
We can go overseas, bring a friend or two
Let me get you charged up like Pikachu
We could hit Ibiza, eat pizza too
Wipe your eyes, keep 'em dry like an Igloo
I ain't hatin' on your hustle, I don't need to lose
Have you eatin' out the country, you could pick a few
Come and sit with a boss, do what bosses do
You ready, baby? Let's ride, let's slide in the coupe
I got a case of the Hennessy and '42
You ever smoked on a thought? Grabbed your thighs, this be the truth
I told shawty, need that top, when we mob, she drop the roof (roof)
Wipe the tears from your eyes, I know you stressin' (stressin')
Wipe the tears from your eyes, girl, you a blessin' (you a blessin')
Me and you got some identical gestures (uh)
Me and you gon' survive all of 'em weapons (we gon' survive)
I swear, me and you can do anything (ah)
Me and you and Hennessy (ah)
Me and you is the remedy of love (ah)
