Squat made the beat
How the fuck I fall for this shit? (Yeah)

If you fuck with my money then you gon' get hit like that
I grew up in the jungle, grew up where lions fall back
Grew up playin' with 22s, now I got 22 straps

Yeah, how the fuck I fall for this shit, yeah
Niggas getting robbed, get hit
I try not to get involved in that shit
But I know niggas don't want me to win, yeah
So many shootouts in the park, we must be gifted
They only missed us 'cause they shot from a distance
And we can't let them get lined by a bitch, yeah
I started thinking with my mind and not my dick, yeah
Stop it, you know that jungle turned me to a monster (monster)
Bunch of young niggas, but we bossed up (bossed up)

Grew up playin' with 22s, now I got 22 straps
