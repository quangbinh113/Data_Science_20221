Song Name: Nevada
Pipe that shit up, TnT

It's Vade on the keys
Niggas dyin', fallin' stars through the night
And I been thinkin' 'bout you every night
If you happy, I know that I should be alright
'Cause this tragic and I can't seem for to decide
And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? Ah
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wrong for the cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock them in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (in Nevada)

Don't know who I want, you the one I want, mm
Never said I don't, that's that money talk, mm, talk
Drunker than a skunk, it go down in the room, down
Choppas in the trunk, baby, this that slime tone
But I need your love like right now, baby, ooh
I'm not on no drugs, not right now, it's the truth (truth)
I apologize for you lookin' like a fool (sorry)
I can't hold you right now so I been holdin' on my tool
I don't want my ex, I don't want no bitch I had (don't)
I just want a chance, hopefully I make you glad (don't)
If you turn me down, tell the truth, I just might spazz (spazz)
If who around laugh, I just probably bust they ass (bust they ass)
And I think I just, I should leave, I just (leave)
Should I leave it 'lone? Ah (should I leave?)
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wrong for the cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock them in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (in Nevada)
