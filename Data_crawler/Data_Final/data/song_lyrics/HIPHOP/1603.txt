Song Name: And This is Just The Intro
I hope you find somebody more toxic
And y'all go through way more arguments than we did
Y'all go through way more arguments than needed
You better give him the same fucking treatment
I know it's just the intro and this shit get deep, but
I've got my reasons
I put my work in it, wasn't worth it
My stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
I made you worth it for somebody else
I endured all of your flaws 'til I
Broke through all the walls of your guard
Now you're perfect for somebody else
I'm 'bout to call her bruh, I ain't gon' lie to you, bruh
I know she's somewhere with a good guy, no
She's out with a guy who push a pretty penny
Her friend just let me know she say
He gets more paper than me, yeah (damn)
There goes my ego
This shit is weak though
My heart is cold as shit, it's bricked
My shit is Shaq at the free-throw
Tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
And you don't even peep though
I let you take 'til there was nothing left of me
Seen it all 'til there was nothing left to see
I know she would leave me, what you telling me?
'Cause when it's said and done, all I got is these melodies
You wasn't there when I was selling CDs
Juggin' at the TD, I was making CCs
Money comin' out, I'm watchin' it in 3D
You told me I'd be nothing, now I'm on the TV
Fast forward, couple years later, see me, yeah
Come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, bitch
Car futuristic, should've come with three seats
Took the last feedback, it don't come with TVs
I stopped wearin' Chrome Hearts and AMIRI jeans
Gettin' too much money and it's bustin' out the seams
Shawty, don't act like I don't meet you on the scene
I only slept on you 'cause you started sellin' dreams
Oh my God, I don't even know, I'm so ashamed right now
She be fuckin' rich niggas since nineteen (nineteen)
No money inside her bags, just drugs and Maybelline
Seems like money's got you doing anything
Anything, anything
Servin' looks, you deaded me all for the finer things
Fuck me good and then you telling me all kinda things
It's like money's got you doing different type of things
Honestly, like I don't know why I did that, but I did, yeah
Girl, I heard you fucked that nigga in some shit I bought you
It hurts to know that that's some different shit I taught you, oh
You left me for someone that was icy
With all that ice, don't you forget
You gotta come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the 'Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the 'Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah
What's it in for? I'm toxic, you know it (you know it)
Whatever your friends say, I'm not shit, and you know it (you know it)
She hopped in my double-R, she'd rather cry tears in the stars
And she knows them other guys in the double-R, ain't like ours
Ain't doing it like us
Movie is playin' and they ain't doing it like us
Maybe I'm toxic, maybe I'm not shit
You wanna fuss and fight for some other option
Liquor, I'm gone
Sip, sippin' 'til I get depressed in this bitch
Then I'ma call you right up on the flip
Fifty reasons why your nigga ain't shit
Fuck them niggas if I'm not at the top
I go crazy, I'ma make this shit hot
DM your nigga, he blow up your spot
Fuck up the relationship that you got
Fucked it up and now I'm calling you mine
There's no real intention of making you mine
I just don't wanna see you with no one else
Like I'm the only one allowed to move on
(I told you)
I'm a fuck boy for sayin' that shit, girl, I know it
I don't deserve you for playin' that like that, I know it
But through these toxic eyes, I see potential
Took advantage of the fact
You gotta come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the 'Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the 'Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me
Want me call, don't you? Don't you?
Every time that I see you, every time that I see you
You woo-hoo-hoo, you woo-hoo-hoo
Every time that I see you, every time that I see you
Why don't you return my calls?
You trip out, where I be
Should know, karma see me
Now you don't got me, see me
