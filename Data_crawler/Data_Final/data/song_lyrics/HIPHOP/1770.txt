Song Name: White Wine
My soldiers come out in the nighttime
The other side we think "should we stay or should we go"
(Should we stay or should we go)
My blood, my family, that's my life line
I've got mobsters in my section flying blow (Flying blow, flying blow)
My Essex gangsters moving white whine
That's why my shooters wear design
Well now you know
My bruva told me Frenchie "write rhymes"
And any place he dream of flying that's where you'll go
(That's where you'll go)
That's where you, that's where you'll go
Anytime you wanna fly gеt the day off, Bake-off, jump on the flight lеt's bounce
She wants sex in a mad location, it's vacant on the plane I'm down
Got it on me while we're driving round scratch the bumper
When the blue light sound
I ain't tryna go pen but it's really intense
So I had to stop beefing clowns
G I spats on the track
And I might go France
I never really last on a full trapped in
Had a tour last week and I filled that dance
Had a little glance and now I can't touch cling
Had the feeling once, had the feeling twice, and now I really feel this in
Got a baddie on me saying she feels my vibe
My soldiers come out in the nighttime
The other side we think "should we stay or should we go"
(Should we stay or should we go)
My blood, my family, that's my life line
I've got mobsters in my section flying blow
(Flying blow, flying blow)
My Essex gangsters moving white whine
That's why my shooters wear design
Well now you know
My bruva told me Frenchie "write rhymes"
And any place he dream of flying that's where you'll go
(That's where you'll go)
That's where you, that's where you'll go
Look
Four man deep in the ride, two waps out Two hands up at the mash then bang
Can't talk shit about my bandit gang
And my b-way boys need elastic bands
Fly to the moon, that's my final plan
G I hate this world but I love my fans
I'm in Spain with a bad one dancing, tango hips in between my hands
I seen cats in the flats
But I never seen racks
Cah I swear that my bros don't talk
Minor
Bro don't trap anymore
'Cause he don't want a raid in his gaff anymore
I got family i Ireland, family in England and I got mobsters abroad
I've seen real life zombies local
No fake shit like it's dust till dawn
