Song Name: Spaceships (feat. Young Thug)
Baby, you can quit callin' my phone (phone)
Ain't no more lovin' back home (home)
Leave a fuckin' message at the dial tone (tone)
Yeah, yeah
I swear I don't feel here (feel)
It can get real weird (real)
Bein' trapped in your own head (yeah)
Bein' trapped in your own head
(Yeah, I'm trapped in my head)
I just flew two bitches in from overseas (oh)
They both from Portugal, they both Portuguese (oh)
Told her behold the pr–µsence of a king
She gon' bow down and get right on her knees
Got a brick on my neck and my wrist a quarter key
We aimin' above the neck, you best move accordingly (bah)
We got this shit on lock, baby, like quarantine
Hold on, wait, I'm just chillin' with your main bitch, yeah
I know I'm the G.O.A.T and I'm the greatest, yeah
I don't gotta brag, don't gotta say shit, yeah
I know I look sad, up in a spaceship, yeah
That's because my mind, it'd be racin', yeah
That's because my mind, it'd be racin', yeah
That's because my mind, it'd be racin', yeah
That's because my mind, it'd be racin', yeah
That's because my mind, it'd be racin', yeah
Africa, bungee jumpin' off of a thin rope, uh
You could be my girl but in public, it's kinfolk
Can't get in my feelings 'bout shit and that's how it go
Half a million, upgrade your closet from Kenneth Cole
Keep it real, I wanna have some sex on a boat
Pushin' it inside you until you say, "Ayy, oh"
Ever since I called you my girl, you've been rockin' Rollies
Pateks and plain jane AP's and rose gold
She say, "I can't wait to leave here with you if you die"
I don't wanna be nowhere near when you cry
Keep it real, I bought you a ring last night
But I don't want you thinkin' that you was a wife
I'm not here to cap, hit a key, baby, high, high
Throw away your car, got a new one to ride, ride
Know when I'm with you, she can't even get a high, high
And if I'm not with you, I can't get a high, high
Baby, you can quit callin' my phone
Ain't no more lovin' back home
Leave a fuckin' message at the dial tone
Yeah, yeah
I swear I don't feel here (feel)
It can get real weird (real)
Bein' trapped in your own head (yeah)
Bein' trapped in your own head
(I'm trapped in my head)
