Song Name: Story Time
Huh
Let me tell a little sad story about this young boy
Grew up, no pops in the crib
That nigga momma workin'
So she couldn't really show him no love when he was a kid (AyoAA)
He didn't even mean to do that incident
He was only 18 when he got caught that bid
He in and out of jail, he ain't know how to move
He ain't know how to fight, he ain't know how to lose
He walked in the spot (spot)
They told him, "Strip, cough, squat" (uh)
The C.O. just told him that this is procedure
But he knew in his mind that he was doin' a lot (uh)
He had to figure it out and then learn all the rules
And then follow them, like it or not
He caught a new charge 'cause he had a little weed
Tryna sneak this shit in, it was right in his sock (ha-ha)
They had him intake for like a week
They hate his guts, they think he killed police
They made it super cold with the AC
They ain't give him no blanket, they ain't give him no sheets
They put him in a cell with a dirty ass sink
He couldn't think, he couldn't sleep
They gave him no soap to wash his ass
They ain't give him no toothpaste to brush his teeth, look
He ain't know why they keep botherin' him
He was kinda scared, ain't wanna argue with him
Pacin' back and forth, they keep on followin' him
Couldn't take it no more, and he finally hit him (yeah, look)
The C.O. done hit the button
And they come and they helpin' him and run in and crack his ass
He just took a beatin' and unleashed the demon
He lookin' to grillin' and actin' bad
He ain't never been locked up before, but he made up his mind
He like, "Fuck it, if this how it start"
They couldn't count him out
'Cause anybody who know lil' homie, know lil' homie got heart
He gon' adapt to his habitat, even if his habitat get dark (uh)
He was a lil' fish when he jumped in the water
And then he grew into a shark (then he grew into a shark)
Two years later (uh), nine fights in, he found his religion
He started workin' out, takin' food, soups and respect 'cause this shit wasn't given
He wanted more for his life, he was sittin' in jail every night
And his life wasn't hittin' (life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't hittin' (his life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't, look (nah)
Two years, he fought the case, and he ain't worry 'bout it
In his mind, he knew he ain't losin'
He got a paid lawyer, that's a good lawyer
And that lawyer do know what he doin'
They wanna take it to trial, so he take it to trial
But that little nigga goin' through it (huh)
He was just holdin' it down for his man's
'Cause he wasn't the one that was doin' the shootin' (bow)
He didn't cop out to this damn lie
Call home and found out his man died
He looked up to the sky like, "Damn, why?"
'Cause he's locked in the cell, and he can't slide
All hell break loose when that man cry
You can see the demon in his damn eyes
That nigga a vampire, hah (baow!)
If he want you dead, then it's verified (baow!)
And he went back in his cell and he thought to himself like, "Damn, I feel a lil' stupid"
He got a big gun in the crib, but he's stuck in the jam, and he can't even use it
He want a re-trial and take back everything that he said 'cause he know he ain't do it
Lil' homie a real nigga, he done made a decision already and he stickin' to it (uh, woo)
Yeah, huh, he stickin' to it, uh
Yeah, huh, huh
Yeah, uh
Fivi, back, look
