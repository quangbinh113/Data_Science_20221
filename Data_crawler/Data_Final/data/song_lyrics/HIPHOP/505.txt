Song Name: How I Was Raised
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid
Pull up in that Murciélago
Bottle of champagne that I pour
Do the dash like Grand Theft Auto
And you can get this semi-auto
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know (I know, yeah)
Shawty give me lovin', shawty give me lovin' (Give me lovin')
With your bitch, probably kissin' and rubbin' (Yeah)
Probably kissin' and touchin' (Yeah)

Yeah, bitch, I rep the block because that's all I know, baby (Rep the block)
800 baby, 1400 baby (Gang, gang, gang)
1400 raised me, 800 raised me (Yeah, yeah)
Found my soul, it saved me (Yeah)
I'ma pull up in that Wraith thing, do the race like Tay-K
Pull up in that Murciélago
Bottle of champagne that I pour
Do the dash like Grand Theft Auto
And you can get this semi-auto
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know (Uh, uh, uh)
That's how I was raised, all I know (Yeah, yeah, uh)
We gon' pull up from Murciélago
Put that boy in the ground like a pothole
Yeah, she hit up my line, see what I'm on
And she say I took off like I'm NASA
And that bitch, she a thot, she get passed off
Feel like Rondo, I don't wanna pass off
Better watch your lil' bitch, she get tapped on
Too ahead of him, know that he mad, yeah
She said that I'm fresh like Bel Air
Think he a demon, send his ass to hell, yeah
Just got the pack, brought it through the mail, yeah
Remember the day that I hit a million
You know I ain't regular, know I ain't civilian
Aim for the top, boy left the ceiling
Your bitch givin' top, nigga, like the ceiling
Don't fuck with your energy, I do not feel him
I said fuck all these niggas
I do not fuck with all these niggas
And I'm stuck with myself
Only gang gon' get bigger
Only gang, only real niggas
Gon' be same gang 'til the fuckin' finish (Oh my God)
Same gang 'til the finish
Pull up in that Murciélago
Bottle of champagne that I pour
Do the dash like Grand Theft Auto
And you can get this semi-auto
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know
That's how I was raised, all I know (I know, yeah)
