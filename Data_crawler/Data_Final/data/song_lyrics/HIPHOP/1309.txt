Song Name: Once Upon A Time (Outro)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh (where you at?)
Feeling down tonight (tonight)
In the summertime (yeah)
I'll find you when it's time (huh)
When all my demons die (huh)
Hold my hand, delight (my hand)
Angel lights will blind
I see the warrior (woo)
Running 'cross to sea
Yelling out, "I'm free" (I'm free)
Somebody go and get me (go)
She fell in love with a beast (woo)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh (where you at?)
Feeling down tonight (tonight)
In the summertime (yeah)
I'll find you when it's time (huh)
When all my demons die (huh)
Hold my hand, delight (my hand)
Angel lights will blind
I see the warrior (woo)
Running 'cross to sea
Yelling out, "I'm free" (I'm free)
Somebody go and get me (go)
She fell in love with a beast (woo)
