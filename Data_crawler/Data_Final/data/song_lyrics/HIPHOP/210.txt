Mike WiLL Made-It
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah
Oh, girl, stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare
Oh, girl, you can stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare
Go ahead and say it
You feel every word that I'm sayin'
Hundred somethin' thousand on the table
I ain't mean to throw it in your face
I don't wanna play those games
I'm not tryna hide my pain
Nigga say he's ballin', I'm like same, same, same, same
She love a different nigga every day
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah (Jxm! Ayy)
You tell me lies, you tell me lies and I'ma listen
You outta your mind and I'm a witness
I'm diggin' your vibe, I'm diggin' your vision
And in the night, we do no kissin', ayy
I can come but I can't stay
Just put that love on layaway
It's always you I put in first place
It's always you I put in first place
But ayy, girl, you can stop right there
Fallin' in love is my worst nightmare
I said, ayy, girl, you can stop that there
Fallin' in love is my worst nightmare (Jxm!)
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah
Oh, girl, you can stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare
Hitting me with that cold stare
Sayin', "Can you help me take these down?"
Talkin' about your box braids
Five minutes later I'm takin' you down
Now you're callin' my name
Thinkin' of me when you're out and about
Ooh, pray for your crew
Pray for your crew, make 'em salute
Watch how I move, cash comin' through
Watch what you do and what you choose
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah
