Song Name: Princess Bubblegum
(Bosley)
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, yuh
Baby, be my bubblegum
I can be so troublesome
I just wanna love you some
You don't gotta owe me nothin'
Now I'm on the road, doin' shows
That's just how it go
Takin' off your clothes, let it show
Money never fold
You my rider 'til we die
You my angel in the sky
Blowin' kisses like a blunt
Baby girl, I'm tryna' stunt
You can be my number one
Won't you be my bubblegum?
Yeah
Won't you be my bubblegum?
