Song Name: NEED YOU MOST (So Sick)
We fight every day and night
You want me to make the time
You always get mad and say what you coulda had
And that you want me to make it right, uh
I couldn't do that to save my life
You always tell me you ain't surprised
You said it's the last time, I guess that you were right
'Cause I'm not the one with you tonight
And now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin', I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up, ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I ain't gon' lie, oh baby I've been fucked up
I said I was sorry for all of the times I fucked up, fuck love
Got me thinkin' while I put my cup up
Tonight is in memory of you, I'm gettin' fucked up
Oh, just one more chance to make it right
Promise I got you, so tell me what's up?
I don't think that I can keep goin' this way
I can't take it
And now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin', I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up, ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
