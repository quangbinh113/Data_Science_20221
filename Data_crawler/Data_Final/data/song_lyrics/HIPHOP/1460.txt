Song Name: Follow God
Father I stretch
Stretch my hands to you
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screaming at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screaming at the referee just like Mike
Looking for a bright light, Sigel, "What Your Lifelike"
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to you)
Pressing on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screaming at my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searching for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Driving with my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to you)
I'm just tryna find, l've been looking for a new way
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, being on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to you)
Arguing with my Dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my Dad (Stretch my hands to you)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"
