Song Name: Wandered To LA (with Justin Bieber)
I wandered to LA
Wandered to LA
True story
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in a Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need
Still we gotta focus on the little things
Never wanna end up how we used to be
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy
That you don't want to be me with me
Especially when I need some company
That's why I need you to come for me
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Ooh, I'm the elephant in the room
Ooh, ooh, my nightmares are startin' to come true
