Song Name: For the Night
I ask myself why we can't be closer
I play those same games a thousand times over
And you crave those long nights with me, oh, don't you?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (we got London on da Track), mmh
I like how you rough around the edges (uh-huh)
Laying on your chest in my bed now
Loving all the days we together (uh-huh)
If they don't get it, then forget it, I do
Yeah, I do, the way I do
And they don't know me like you
All the things that we've been through
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Lovе when you call me "baby," make mе feel like a lady (ay)
And we go rough around that K.O., love is never lazy
But when I wake up, you ain't there and now I'm going crazy (mmh)
I ask myself why we can't be closer
I play those same games a thousand times over
And you crave those long nights with me, oh, don't you?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (for the night, for the night, for the night)
I know them other girls, yeah, they all the same
You could have the world or you could have a lay
I'ma give it to you and I don't hesitate
If I call you up, then you know that I'm on my way
You and your mouth, cashing checks that you know gonna bounce
You say you promise and promise, you'll figure it out
But I can not wait, you're teasing me, I back down
I ask myself why we can't be closer
I play those same games a thousand times over (baby)
And you crave those long nights with me, oh, don't you?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (Big Latto)
Uh, that don't mean you good, they only love you at your best (girl)
You know where to come and crash when your life a wreck (come here)
Walked in stressed, left with hickeys on your neck (mwah)
Pull up, get to spin on that mic like Funk Flex
You need a bitch who know what to do with you (do with you)
Call you up like "Where you at?" and "Nigga, who with you?" (brr)
I'm the only one know everything you like (you like)
You can have this for the night or for your life
I ask myself why we can't be closer
I play those same games a thousand times over (a thousand times over)
And you crave those long nights with me, oh, don't you? (You know you do, you)
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (we got London on da Track, Track, Track)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
