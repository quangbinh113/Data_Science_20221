Song Name: Karma
I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, if you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah
I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
The kind's red in a flyin' saucer
And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't ya heard the word 'round town, how I get down?
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
When that ass wit chu, got my dick hard as a missle
Don't hop on top 'cuz I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be outta town with a issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to Mama, girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabanna
I'm so used to your Prada, I take trips 'cuz out in Houston it's hotta
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Lay my jewels on my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I holla'd
Tryna squeeze in, but you wouldn't bothered
Now I ain't either, soon as I realize that I ain't need her
She in a rush to get close to me, but I ain't eager, shit
I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, if you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah
Look, I don't mean to bother you
But ya sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in a park wit chu
There ain't no tellin' the kinda things that I'ma start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast
I can tell you feel the same,'cuz when I asked, you laughed
So I'ma, leave it at that take a hint and put in my math
I imagine you probly look twice as good in a bath
And I'm buggin', 'cuz I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable 'cuz business is on my ass
But you can be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit I been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' wit
'Cuz, most of these broads just have they eyes on my grit
Till they ain't get shit and learn to be satisfied with the dick
And, if you ain't worth it, that's all you get
I ain't gonna blame you, I'ma blame all you tricks, 'cuz
I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, if you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah
It seems like your attitude
Only appears when I'm mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When I'm gone too long ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home, it's rumors an scattered news
You know my fantasies, am I feeling things?
Or can this be your girlfriends tryna to sandwich me
My hearts colder than sandwich meat
'Cuz I, come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast, but I switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin' your body like this
Gon' make me blow like a bottle of Cris
Man, I don't know no one hotter to twist
You got my temperature risin', from your hips to your thighs an'
That glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em as easy as 1, 2, 3
And I slide in
I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, if you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah
I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, if you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah
