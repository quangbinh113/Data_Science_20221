Song Name: Love You More (with Nate Ruess, Gunna & Jeff Bhasker)
No, I'm not tryin'
To be the last thing you see when you turn your light off
You're makin' me feel some feel
But I know that it's wrong
Can't you see?
It's not who I wanna be, yeah
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
Hoping you call 'bout anything
I love when you call me about anything
I love how you don't doubt anything
Like I said, get anything
'Cause I love the way you call my phone
And texted me, "Good morning"
Two shots of Patrón, and we sexing to the morning
Hate when you don't cum, you done told a nigga it's corny
Walking around with an attitude, I'm supposed to be at a party
Girl, you know I love you, ain't disrespect whenever I'm tardy
Walking around with a shopping cart, we tearing down Barney's
Oh, girl, I want you badly
'Cause I love you more than anything (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Oh, I love you more than anything
(Love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (oh yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (more than any, more than anything)
Don't ask about petty things
Don't have to beg, she get anything
I love her bad, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
(Love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (oh yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (more than any, more than anything)
Patrón
Oh, yes, I love you, how I do you
Put you up, I want more for you
Have my heart, I hold you close
I won't let go of you
You the definition of loyal, and I know it's true
I give my heart to you
Hope you know it's not love lost
'Cause I love you
