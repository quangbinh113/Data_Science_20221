Song Name: KAPITOL DENIM
(Yeah)
Yeah, pull up on the curb and I'm thuggin', yeah
I'm 'bout to spend a dub on luggage
Got a hunnid rounds in the choppa, bitch wanna fuck on my brother
Share the same pain and struggle, it ain't nothin' comin' between us, yeah
Hermes curtains and the Maybach plush, sippin' on syrup, that sticky stuff
I got these diamonds on me, they be shinin' on me, all these bitches on me, oh-woah (oh-woah)
Some crazy girls out in Cali from all 'round the globe, I been on the road
Plain Jane watch, money don't stop
Buy me a plane, I'ma land it on the block
Just to deal with this shit, niggas gotta be hot
Ayy, ayy
I pop rocks, it look just like racks
Pink, blue, money drop, Percs' and the green
Major, they love me, I never get lost
Sex, money, drugs, want it tatted on me
Hurt my feelings and I got no flaws
Real rockstar with a .40 in reach
Save your soul and I'ma put it in the vault
Broke my heart and you put it on the screen
30mg 'cause that pain shit talk
Ran out of Wock', throw the Tris' in the peach
Super good Glocks, never diss over beats
Too much pride, gotta know what's the feat
Super loud Jeep, gotta notice it's me
Range over Tune, she in love in the STR8
Three Perc' Tune, you can see it in my face
Real pop 30, but the Perc' situates
I pop rocks, it look just like racks
Pink, blue, money drop, Percs' and the green
Major, they love me, I never get lost
Sex, money, drugs, want it tatted on me
Yeah, pull up on the curb and I'm thuggin', yeah
I'm 'bout to spend a dub on luggage
Got a hunnid rounds in the choppa, bitch wanna fuck on my brother
Share the same pain and struggle, it ain't nothin' comin' between us, yeah
Hermes curtains and the Maybach plush, sippin' on syrup, that sticky stuff
I got these diamonds on me, they be shinin' on me, all these bitches on me, oh-woah (oh-woah)
Some crazy girls out in Cali from all 'round the globe, I been on the road (oh)
Plain Jane watch, money don't stop (yeah)
Buy me a plane, I'ma land it on the block (yeah)
Just to deal with this shit, niggas gotta be hot
