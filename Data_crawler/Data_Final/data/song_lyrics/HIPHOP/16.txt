Song Name: Lift Yourself
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Hard to see, ooh
The hang-ups we have today-ay-ay
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself upon your feet
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift your, lift your, lift yourself
Lift, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift, lift
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay
But they don't really realize, though
Said we need to strive for more liberty
This next verse, this next verse though
Lift yourself upon your feet
These bars
Lift yourself upon your feet
Watch this some shit go
Poopy-di scoop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop
Poop-di-scoopty
Scoopty-whoop
Whoopity-scoop, whoop-poop
Poop-diddy, whoop-scoop
Poop, poop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop, poop
