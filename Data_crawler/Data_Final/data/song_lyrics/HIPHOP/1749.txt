Song Name: Sneaky Link Shemix
(Rrr-run it up)
Boy, you just my sneaky link
So don't keep texting me
I'm not your bitch, stop checking me
You come last when he next to me
His special bitch, no recipe
Like Salt Bae, open sesame
You callin' while he sextin' me
I'm such a freak
He cum fast when I say link
Got him saved as 'Uber Eats'
What's the plan? I say Plan B
You can't take me out the streets
I'm fat mun nu a mami (yeah)
Ain't no bun, you just my link
I got body and good brain
He my break when my heart break
I step on bitches' necks
Then go ride they nigga chest
He gon' shoot 'cause I'm the best
I ghost him 'cause he a guest
Save me last 'cause I'm the best
Before he eat, I say, "God bless"
He be heartin' all my shit
But he could never picture this
Boy, you just my sneaky link (sneaky link, Queen shit, bitch)
B-bo-boy, you just my sneaky link
Is you tryin' to be my man?
You already know, Key can't fuck fans
You already know, Key fucked your friends
You already know, Key can't pretend, yeah
Play a nigga like a band
Cut a nigga off, same day, bought a Benz
Cut a nigga off, same day, rebrand
I'on want to talk if a nigga ain't payin'
Bitch, I got that crack if he it from the back
He gon' get attached like a track
Eat me from the back, pussy fat like a cat
Pussy on his face, my shit act like a tat
That bitch had to pack 'cause he act like a rat
Bitch, you can't be my sneaky link
What the fuck you think, nigga
What the fuck you thought
I'm a fuckin' boss
Bitch, you got to pay the cost
Eat my pussy off
Ain't my fault, that bitch exhausted
'Cause her nigga lost it
Boy, you just my sneaky link (sneaky link, sneaky link)
B-bo-boy, you just my sneaky link
Rrr-run it up
