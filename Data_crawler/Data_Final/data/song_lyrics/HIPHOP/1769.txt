Song Name: Public Figure
(Play no wass)
Two hands in the air, no bread, he's still gonna run that dinner
What them man got ain't big, my side of the 6, guns that's bigger
Louis, Chanel, Celine on me
It's clear, I'm a public dripper
Still might do it in public
Even though I know I'm a public figure
Public figure, I know I'm a public figure
Offwhite, he a public driller
Did that up with his public dipper
In and out with this public fig'
Don't wanna get caught in public with her
Gotta have someone that's on spinnin'
Spillin' 'cah I'm a public figure
I know I'm an artist, but if I see three numbers, know I'm spinnin' the coupe
Public figure, really done hittins
I got a hitter when I'm in the stu'
One YG ain't got shit on his knife
He told me, "Bro, tryna get mе a few"
I told him straight, "No one don't care if thеm drills that you do ain't hittin' the news"
Huh, heard my man's hittin' it, can't be jealous, I'm hittin' it too
Know what to do, I'll stick it and move
Don't wave in the air, I'll stick it in goons
If you rep a block I don't like
What's the chance I'ma stick it in you?
'Member when I first bought Liz?
That crack came yellow, Winnie The Pooh
My life been topsy turvy
Clean the apartment, dirty bando
Offensive weapon clean, but I left that scene with a dirty Rambo
Judge gave Lupee seven
Said that's nuttin' that I can't handle
If the C.A.T. says, "Give me the light"
Just know he don't want no candle
Plugged In money got me a suttin'
Pissed me off, I ain't throwin' no hands
Kinder Bueno, digital scales
My trap got more than a hundred cats
The runners that I be walkin' in
Cost me roughly a hundred grams
The man there dickheads, my ting different
Came out of jail to a hundred bands
Fly uptown, no valid reason
Buy whatever the fuck's in season
Put my blacks on, you know the vibes
See me a paigon, you know the meanin'
She got a man, with me, she's cheatin'
Use to tag up food in Steven's
I'm in a Bentley, Bentayga, interior, Reese's Pieces
Free Crash, always ready, leg shot? No, tryna get skelly
Cartier frozen, diamonds wet
Man, I just score and get me a skelly
Free SJ, spent his time tryna put opps in the air, heli
I know I'm a public figure, still tryna put it on telly
Two hands in the air, no bread, he's still gonna run that dinner
What them man got ain't big, my side of the 6, guns that's bigger
Louis, Chanel, Celine on me
It's clear, I'm a public dripper
Still might do it in public
Even though I know I'm a public figure
Public figure, I know I'm a public figure
Off-White, he a public driller
Did that up with his public dipper
In and out with this public fig'
Don't wanna get caught in public with her
Gotta have someone that's on spinnin'
Spillin' 'cah I'm a public figure
