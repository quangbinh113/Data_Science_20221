Song Name: Hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', hustlin', hustl-
Hustlin', hustlin', hustl-
Hustlin', hustlin', hustl-
Hustlin', hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm-, every day I'm-, every day I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm-, every day, I'm-, every day, I'm hustlin'
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I'm the fuckin' boss
745, white-on-white, that's fuckin' Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat (what?)
I keep 'em comin' back (what?), we keep 'em comin' back
I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them motherfuckers flyin' 'cross the Atlantic (woo!)
I know Pablo (Pablo), Noriega (Noriega)
The real Noriega, he owe me a hundred favors (chuuch)
I ain't petty, nigga, we buy the whole thang
See, most of my niggas really still deal cocaine
My roof back (roof back), my money right (my money right)
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatched Black, I cried for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustl-
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm- every day, I'm
We never steal cars, but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it-whip it real hard
I caught a charge (you caught a charge?), I caught a charge (yeah?)
Whip it real hard, whip it-whip it real hard
Ain't 'bout no funny shit, still bitches and business
I'm on my money shit, still whippin' them Benzes (woo)
Major league, who catchin'? Because I'm pitchin' (I'm pitchin')
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finished
I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens (my chickens)
They flyin' over-Pacific, to be specific
Triple C's, you know it's fact, we holdin' sacks
So nigga, go on, rat (go on, rat), run and tell 'em that (tell 'em that)
More cars (more cars), more hoes (more hoes)
More clothes (more clothes), more blow
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustl-
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm- every day, I'm
It's time to spend my thrills (thrills), custom spinnin' wheels (wheels)
I ain't drove in a week, them bitches spinnin' still (still)
Talk about me, 'cause these suckers scared to talk about me
Killers chalkin' 'bout me (what? Chalkin'), it ain't no talk about me (what? It ain't no talk about me)
It ain't no walkin' 'round me (it ain't no walkin' 'round me), see all these killers 'round me?
Lot of drug-dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County (woah)
Don't tote no (22's), Magnum cost me (22)
Sat it on them (22's), birds go for (22)
Lil' mama super thick (thick), she say she (22)
She seen 'em (22's), we in Room (222)
I touch work, like I'm Convertible Burt (Burt)
I got distribution, so I'm convertin' the work (work)
In the (M-I-yayo) them niggas rich off (yayo)
Steady slangin' (yayo), my Chevy bangin' (ayo)
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustl-
Every day, I'm hustlin', e-every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm hustlin'
Every day, I'm hustlin', every day, I'm- every day, I'm
