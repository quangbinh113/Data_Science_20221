Song Name: Hard Work Pays Off
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper at your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens
Blood all on the Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's
I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch
Blue face everywhere
Pull up, they stare
Fendi, my underwear
She suck my dick she like, "Damn"
I didn't need a money counter (count em')
Money all on the kitchen counter
I think I need a money counter (count em')
Money all on the kitchen counter
Call my doctor to handle my pain
Perky's taking my life away
I'ma bag your bitch because I can
And I'ma go take your wife away
Choppa on me, Afghanistan
That bitch kill many men
Over the bag, over the cash, yeah
I'm a money fan
Over the bag, on your ass, yeah
Hopping out the van
Switched up the the Lamb
How you niggas like me now? Yeah
No limit, the game
Try it, they gonna shoot you down, yeah
Loaded up, they gon' gun you down
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper at your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Dripping on them everyday, steak sauce
Put the chopper at your head, take it off
Fast lane, taking it off
Breaking your ankle, Chris Paul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so on 'em now my legacy will never fade
I've been traumatised before but still I'm not afraid
I done see friends turn foe, it don't amaze me
Came from the bottom of the creek, shit was ugly
Made it to the top of the mountain drankin' muddy
Everybody around me change and I felt so neglected
Hopping on the bird, with some birds, they respected (yeah, yeah)
24/7 everyday we get it in (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, started living out my dream, feel like I was born again
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper at your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens
