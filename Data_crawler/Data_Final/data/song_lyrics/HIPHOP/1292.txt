Song Name: Wockesha
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but uhm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup
What's in your cup, what's in their cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done
I probably should pick that cup back up (haha)
I'm seein' her lookin' like Keisha, like
"Do you love me, do you love me not?"
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (candy), sweet like fruit (ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I popped back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffe cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie, you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', "Pour me"
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (that strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' my home (in my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with a heart to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (that somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm
