Song Name: Monsieur Dior
I got a problem showing someone love and not getting it back
It's easy to love when my love not attached
Plenty fishes in the sea, but none of them a catch
My head got my ego high and 12 on my ass
My feelings on my shoulders with my hands counting the cash
My niggas getting money, but they only get it fast
I use to run in stores, just to claim I'm popping tags
And when we run in bitches, it's a smash, never grab, yeah
I would hit them lick and then I dip across the Ave'
I ain't have no crib, so I would hit them in the trap
Niggas talkin' shit, see, that's the only timе I laugh
I got a problem showing people lovе that I never had
Got so many problems, fuck the jail, fuck the judge, fuck the bail, fuck the law
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (yuh)
Got so many problems that I prayed to the Lord and I prayed to Allah
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (yuh)
I'm feelin' like (yeah), I'm feelin' like (yeah)
I need to hit the switches for the ceiling' light
The room is kinda dark, I'm tryna get it bright
I'm lookin' at the clock because it's takin' time
It's ticking, ticking
Back when Tigg was in the basement, I was sitting, chillin' (uh-huh)
I was studying the greatness, I was sitting witness (uh-huh)
Niggas flexing with they necklace, it was really fitness (yeah, yeah)
Back and forth, I'm contemplating like I'm playin' tennis
I'm just tryna see me finish, everything I said that I would do
I'm tryna fix my image, confident, I'm never timid
They still tryna judge me for my past while my problem showing people love that I never had
Was raised by the wolves, wasn't raised by my fam'
Rest in peace to my momma and my dad
So many problems, fuck the jail, fuck the judge, fuck the bail, fuck the law
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (yuh)
Got so many problems that I prayed to the Lord and I prayed to Allah
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (yuh)
I got a problem showing someone love and not getting it back
