Song Name: Stick By My Side
Karltin
Cook this up (Cook this up)
God as my witness, I just caught a bond
I should probably wear a vest for all the stress I'm under
But shawty never scared 'cause she stick by my side
And I stay with that stick by my side
Bitch, I'm rich 'til I die, yeah
Bitch, I'm rich 'til I die
Shawty never scared 'cause she stick by my side
And I stay with that stick by my side (Yeah)
Tired of fighting charges, swiping cards (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm rich 'til I die, yeah
Ayy, rich 'til I die
Pull up on me and get hit with that fire (Rrrah)
That Draco in my hand but the Glock on my side (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And just like the sun I put him in the sky, yeah
I'm a rich nigga with a wife beater (No cap)
I'm in the coupe cruising with four heaters
I got a bad bitch she a meat eater (Yeah)
If you want you a verse I need five for a feature (No cap)
I'm fresh out that can like a Vienna sausage (Yeah)
I pop me a Perc' then I pop me a Roxy (Yeah)
These niggas be snitchin', I call 'em Tekashi (Yeah)
If he tell on me you know he get bodied
I point him out then my shooter gon' get 'em
Cheerleader bullets because they gon' split 'em
I ain't doin' no playin', I dont fuck with you niggas
Drop yo' location get up wit' a nigga
God as my witness, I just caught a bond
I should probably wear a vest for all the stress I'm under
But shorty never scared 'cause she stick by my side
And I stay with that stick by my side
Bitch, I'm rich 'til I die, yeah
