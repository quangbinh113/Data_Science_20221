Song Name: 2055
I just wanna slide
Like it's 2055, huh
I just wanna ride
(Great John on the beat by the way) like it's 2055, huh
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (huh)
Why would you sacrifice? (Huh)
Knowing you could die, ain't nobody by your side, huh
I know niggas cap (cap) and bitches lie
Came from dirt, can't go back
You could see it in my eyes, huh
Real niggas cry blood (blood)
Hope my kid never tries drugs (huh)
All I wanted was some love, I would that trade for a gun (huh)
Bick pack on me now, remember back then I was fucked up, huh
I don't want friends, everybody fake, I don't got trust, but-
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice
(Some water and some ice, some water and some ice, huh)
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice (nice), boy you nice (nice)", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice
Shawty bad, energize, huh
Livin' life, spilled some liquor on her inner thigh
But she ain't tired, she just turn it up, huh
I could get you brushed, huh
Zaza got me stuck, sorry I can't open up
Fuckin' with me, try (huh)
Gotta compromise (huh)
He want beef with gang
But he don't know it come with fries (huh)
They say kids are nice (huh)
Please don't play with mines (huh)
My body different, I know they love that line but-
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice (nice), boy you nice (nice)", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice
(Some water and some ice, some water and some ice)
