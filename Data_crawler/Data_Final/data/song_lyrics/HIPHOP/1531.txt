Will A Fool
Uh, you ever feel like you're worthless? (Graah)
Like you ain't worth shit? (Yeah)
And I know that I ain't perfect, but you know that I'm worth it, uh (yeah)
Tryna find some to do in my time, ease my pain, get you off my mind
Three cellphones, I've been on my grind
No more love means no lies
And I tried, yeah, Lord knows I tried (yeah, yeah)
Smokin' dope back to back, I'm fried
Thuggin' for three days, see the pain in his eyes (yeah)
Tryna get over pride
And I'm here to let 'em know (let 'em know, gotta let 'em know)
If you love 'em, don't let 'em go (let 'em go, tell me, why would you ever let 'em go?)
I found your headband on the bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes (yeah, yeah)
Remember all of times, on Pinellas Point Drive?
Actin' like you was fine, a broken heart in disguise
Love the nigga to death, even though I was tellin' lies
The day that we run away, all the stars aligned
It's the same old thing (yeah, yeah)
It's the same old song (yeah)
One day, you're here, next day you're gone
All of the fuss, and all of the fights
All the early mornings, and the long nights
All the who's right's, and all the who's wrong's (yeah, yeah)
Just to end up alone (all alone, ended alone)
Just to end up alone (all alone, just to end up alone)
Just to end up alone (all that work, all that time)
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Don't leave me alone
Aye, let me hear that, Chino
Let me see where I'm at with that bih
Grrah, grrah
