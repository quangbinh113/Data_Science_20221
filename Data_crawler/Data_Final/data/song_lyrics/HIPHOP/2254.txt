Song Name: Still Tippin' (feat. Slim Thug and Paul Wall)
Still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
I'm still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
Now look who creepin', look who crawlin', still ballin' in the mix
It's that six-six, long dick, slim nigga stickin' your chick
Pullin' tricks, lookin' slick at all times when I'm flippin'
Barre sippin', car dippin', Grant wood grain grippin'
Still tippin' on fo' fo's (Still tippin' on fo' fo's)
Wrapped in fo' vogues (Wrapped in fo' vogues)
Pimpin' fo' hoes (Pimpin' fo' hoes)
And I'm packin' fo' fo's (And I'm packin' fo' fo's)
Blowin' on that indo, GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me 'cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit' a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up, creased up, stayin' dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin' Sprewells slidin' like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent SwishaHouse (Ha!)
Still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
I'm still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
Fo' fo's I'm tippin', wood grain I'm grippin'
Catch me lane switchin' with the paint drippin'
Turn your neck and your dame missin'
Me and Slim we ain't trippin', I'm figure flippin' and syrup sippin'
Like do or die, I'm po' pimpin'
Car stop, rims keep spinnin'
I'm flippin' drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shakin' the block with four eighteens
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got dirt on the brim with a pint of lean
It takes grindin' to be a king, it takes grindin' to be a king
First Round Draft Picks comin', Who is Mike Jones comin'
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones, (Who?) Mike Jones
The one and only, you can't clone me
Got a lot of haters and a lot of homies, some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me (I said!)
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
I'm still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
What it do? It's Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawlin' similar to an ant, 'cause I'm low to the Earth
People's feelings get hurt, when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fo's pokin' out, at the club I'm showin' out
I'm a player, ain't no doubt, hoes want to know what I'm 'bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth, princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range, drippin' stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name, it's still the same, SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast
Mike Jones, he runnin' the game and Magnificent 'bout his cash
Michael Watts, he made me hot, hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot, he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet goin' nuts
But T. Farris got my back, so now I'm holdin' my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby, what you know 'bout me?
I'm on that five nine Southlea, baby, holla at me
Still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
I'm still tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Tippin' on fo'-fo's, wrapped in fo'-vouges
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
