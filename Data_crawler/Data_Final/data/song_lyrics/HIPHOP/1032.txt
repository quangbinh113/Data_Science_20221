Pussy got hit in the head, don't mention my name, he got hit in the leg (on God)
Get out the car if you scared, we went through they hood, and we painted it red (21)

Hit your bitch with the dick, now she cockeyed (on God)

Too much money to beef 'bout a hoe

Hundred racks on the drop, pull up on they block, poppin' at the opps (pop)
Caught a nigga with his bitch slippin' at the light, he got in his top
Hit him in his top
Hundred racks on your T-O-P (woah)
