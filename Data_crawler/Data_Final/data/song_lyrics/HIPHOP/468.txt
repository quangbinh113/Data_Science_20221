Song Name: Best You Had
Ramyonthebeat
Oh, oh, uh, Ross
Hit it two times for the one time (One time)
One time on the low 'cause she know I can't go (Oh)
Got her best friend and an old girl (Best friend)
And a new girl that I fucked that I didn't even know
Right about now I'm rolling (Right about now)
Off of two pills and a soda out to Texaco
Don't ask me what I'm holding
Doing these drugs is a part of that show bizz
Outta my mind been lately (Outta my mind)
Too much money, can't make me (Too much money)
Pull up damn, she naked, damn, she naked
Outta my mind been lately (Outta my mind)
Too much money, can't make me (Too much money)
Pull up damn, she naked, damn, she naked
I done lost you once, ain't tripping, I'm getting you back (You back)
Me being down, who, me? I'm the best you had (You ever had)
Best you had (Ooh, yeah)
Best you had (Ooh, yeah)
Me and you talking, go on and on (Yeah)
You suck the cooler, the heart and soul (Oh)
All of you make me I'm all in all
You gave me head with no Tylenol
Fuck in this club, can be hard to fuck
I hide a niggle from all of y'all
Pull up the function, I'm calling my dawg (Ooh)
Pull up the function, I'm calling my dawg (Ooh)
Hit it two times for the one time (One time)
One time on the low 'cause she know I can't go (Oh)
Got her best friend and an old girl (Best friend)
And a new girl that I fucked that I didn't even know
Right about now I'm rolling (Right about now)
Off of two pills and a soda out to Texaco
Don't ask me what I'm holding
Doing these drugs is a part of that show bizz
Outta my mind been lately (Outta my mind)
Too much money, can't make me (Too much money)
Pull up damn, she naked, damn, she naked
Outta my mind been lately (Outta my mind)
Too much money, can't make me (Too much money)
Pull up damn, she naked, damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
Damn, she naked
