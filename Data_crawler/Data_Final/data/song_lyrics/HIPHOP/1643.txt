Song Name: Two Infinity Links
An infinity link
See that's the strongest link in the world
By far stronger than a Cuban
It runs in the blood
(Buddah, bless this beat) go
I promise to always rep my city, especially where I'm from (go)
Wanna come back to the hood and put you on, you don't owe a crumb (no)
Just put lil' bro on somethin' (yeah), just put lil' bro on somethin' (go)
Don't put that hoe on nothin' (no), don't put that bitch on nothin' (bitch)
I never wanna see the day I lose my bro to one (damn)
Before the cake, before the stage, we split up honey buns (split up)
5:30, mama house, we was all sons (mama)
85 NAWF (go), where we all from (Migo)
If it wasn't for P, shit, it probably wouldn't be no me (true story)
And if it wasn't for me, shit, it prob' wouldn't be QC (uh-uh)
Just some young rich niggas, tryna get it out the streets (get it)
Can't let bitches, can't let money, ego, come between the team (go)
I'm gettin' this while I'm listening to this shit, I can't believe
That I fell for a bitch that tried to knock me off my P (P)
What you see? Look at me, what you think? I'm a bitch
Fuck them Ms, take a brick (what?), make a bill' in this bitch (bill')
5:30 with a bando phone (bando), mama, me, and my grandma son
Cookin' up in the basement, tryna get me a billion like Donda's son
14-7 nines (talk to me), since I was fixin' nines
Blowin' Irene, it was ak for the lean, I was still geeked out my mind (try)
Then I go ride with the boogers in the booger, first time that I couldn't tell time (ice)
And it got so damn hot, had to move the spot, the North side dry
If it was you, you could never be me (nah)
I'm the first one that said "QC" (chill out)
I ain't never gon' tuck my tail (nah)
I'm a nigga from the NAWF, for real (NAWF)
He poppin' it, tryna get popular, but he know he's that foot in that field (stop it)
We can see he ain't real (uh-uh), don't touch him, he'll squeal (please don't)
I know niggas cried, but they get active on that drill
Nigga, ain't nothin' lied, beside the engine and these Ms (vroom, M&M)
Takin' a camera and makin' a film
Water on me, man, you know I can swim
Counted me out, but you know I'll win (you know that)
Why question the shit that I did? (Why?)
You know I had visions of this shit since I was a kid (real talk)
I priced it out and got blessed, but look at what God did (infinity)
Infinity
