Song Name: Iâ€™m So Awesome
Uh, hopped out to spray, then I hopped in the Wraith
Yeah, I'm havin' fun today
Step on these niggas and Dave and I play
Yeah, that's what my mama say
Get you some money, you stay here, you payed
You can't be sittin' in my mansion all day
I go to prison, I'm havin' my way
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Go to Morocco and fuck on a fine ho', I'm so, I'm so awesome
Think how she fine and she gon' get designer
No, bitch, you'll drop somethin'
Jay my dawg, you know, he been my Whitney
Fuck with him low and he known me since Peewee
Remember them times I was fuckin' on Fifi
Yeah, uh, thanks for them letters, real nice, you get CC
All of my bitches be yellow, like Beezy
Flex on these niggas, I make it look easy
I'm draggin' my nuts, they be all on my Fiji
Drippin' on these bitches, they eatin' my spit up
Ran out of gas, I'ma need me a fill up
She say I rate the bitch, no, but I bet her
I got too much money, ain't doin' no sit-up
Hopped out to spray, then I hopped in my bag
Yeah, I'm in my Birkin
Shoutout to Gucci, I think that's my dad
Yeah, I was just jerkin'
I hit the Woah 'cause I like that lil' dance
I be on go, you gon' live where you stand
Pull out the Ghost, I'm too rich for a band
Mmh, yeah
Louis be callin' me Daddy and shit, uh, that's my baby
Shorty be ignorin' her kids for me, hmm, 'cause they need savin'
This how I'm livin', I'm deadass
End of your girl, your lil' head ass
Like when you callin' me Daddy, haha
Daddy, Zaddy, pullin' up, I'm on the addy
They searched the crib and I still got a gun in the attic
I done got real and established
This wasn't 'posed to happen, 'cause I was just jackin' and stuff
I turn a nigga to maggots, yeah, he dead, flies everywhere
I done created the fabric y'all niggas be jackin'
So they gotta pay me to wear
Courvoisier is a poor, nigga, drink
But I'm drinkin', you need a license to share
I'ma see y'all like a Z and I Z who I Z, that's just the way that I am
Courvoisier is a poor, nigga, drink, but I drank it, I tank it
I keep some saks in the MAC and it shake in my blanket, the blanket
I keep security 'cause I'm tired of shootin'
I be on tears and my eyes be googly
Big dumbass rupees on all of my toothies
Ass shots, I put that fire on your booty
Hop in and spray soon as I hop out the coochie
I'm a clean lil' nigga, I'm awesome
I got a whole lotta demands
I ain't want a Benz, so I bought my dawg one
I don't be countin' the Maybach truck
Even though it's a Benz, I don't it count though
30 inch rounds, gotta mount it though
I'ma treat you like you weren't my ram before
Candy paint Lambo', just hopped out to spray
I keep some bands on me, just to go play
Run out of family, you niggas okay
You ain't got no parents and you just in my way
Step on these niggas, I stand on the hoes
Cutthroat nigga, yeah, anythin' go
I hop out the 'Ville, fixin' my pistol
Pounce out on niggas, I look like I'm Tyga
