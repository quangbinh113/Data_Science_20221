Song Name: Early Morning Trappin (feat. Trippie Redd)
Was up trappin' early?
She bad and boujee But whippin' a birdie
My cup is so dirty
Your diamonds don't shine, my pinkie a 30
Pour up the pint, that's so clean
The rims of the Bentley cost 14
Ain't doin' no talkin', the red beam
My bitches perplexing, young nigga we flexin'.
So much green on my street like it's grove
Made a lot of money on the road
Now they book me 10k for a show
Actavis in my drink I'ma pour, yeah.
Like I know the dots
I'ma beat her box
Beatin' off her f*ckin' socks
30 gotta mop, shoot you look like chicken pox
I be whippin' rocks
Fiends and me, they sniffin' rocks
I'm a trapstar, ayy
Hope I don't crash
Do the dash in a NASCAR, ayy
Really is a fast car
It's a movie just like Pixar, movie just like Pixar
Get shot out turn your a*s to clip-art
Yeah turn you a*s to clip-art, boy you is a retard
On the go just like a go-cart
Makin' art just like Mozart, art just like Mozart.

Early morning trappin'.
Was up trappin' early?
She bad and boujee But whippin' a birdie
My cup is so dirty
Your diamonds don't shine, my pinkie a 30
Pour up the pint, that's so clean
The rims of the Bentley cost 14
Ain't doin' no talkin', the red beam
My bitches perplexing, young nigga we flexin'.
So much green on my street like it's grove
Made a lot of money on the road
Now they book me 10k for a show
Actavis in my drink I'ma pour, yeah.
Pull up with Trippie
Pull off with your bh, put d*ck in her kidneys
More Act I'm sippin
These niggas in line to get to the milli
AP two-tone, she suckin' my d*ck
Wanna fk wit my ice on
She said she gon' write home (Huh, what)
She bad and boujee gon' whip up a birdie
My cup is so dirty
You niggas is fraud, your diamonds is blurry
I'm trappin' the 30
I don't do no cap
Racks all in the cabinet
They was hatin', I was rackin', stackin', and relaxin'
Dream might get a hunded bands
Now I'm ridin' round in the Lamb
She bad and boujee
I'm makin' movies, might fk a bh on camera
I need a Fanta and got served

I might just hop out the Vert
She wanna hop out her skirt
That's when she poppin' the perc.
Was up trappin' early?
She bad and boujee But whippin' a birdie
My cup is so dirty
Your diamonds don't shine, my pinkie a 30
Pour up the pint, that's so clean
The rims of the Bentley cost 14
Ain't doin' no talkin', the red beam
My bitches perplexing, young nigga we flexin'.
So much green on my street like it's grove
Made a lot of money on the road
Now they book me 10k for a show
Actavis in my drink I'ma pour, yeahhh.
