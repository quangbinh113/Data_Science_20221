Song Name: Time
It's only up from here
Saw couple greys and touched my beard
Still out here looking young, just lost some hair
I've been swinging my sword, a musketeer
Up early on that morning rush for years
Blueprint, building a construction
The wrong leaders, will lead you to destruction
I, never trust 'em
I, sold drugs but I, never touched 'em
Sold to customers, then eruption
Fuck the radio, I blew like a volcano
Standing next to Kano, I'm posted up with Maino
All my shooters, they been with man from day though
I'm a street nigga
I'm so busy, I just gotta keep my month full
I gotta level, up, gotta get uncomfortable
But still amongst them, dysfunctional
Savages on timing, gotta keep punctual
They said I wouldn't make it, "He's a failure"
I'm still in niggas' faces, on your radar
I'm big in different places, I'm too cold, yeah
They been tryna replace me, it's gettin' old
Time, it's only gotten faster
I gotta keep it moving, got so much to look after
I live through the guidance
Keep digging, gotta dig for your diamonds
Time's ticking, listen
Is this the way I go?
Everyday I think about that, there's not a day I don't
These niggas braggin 'bout what they did first
I never talk about shit, that's the way I go
I'ma play the game well, get that players' dough
I just spoke to M.O., said he's layin' low
Mum started up the business and she say, "It's slow"
It'll pick up soon, just stay on the flow
And my soldier never says nothin', just stands on his own
He's just like that, he's just playing his role
My nigga hit me, he was stressed
Think he wanted to talk, that's a minor
Told him, "Stay on the phone", 'cause I don't mind that
Just keep on moving cautious, just don't slip up, bro
But keep it moving forward
Fourth floor and I'm lookin at these quarters
I'm growing my own flowers and keeping them all watered
The devil's got his pitchfork, and he's loud
You should never look a gift horse, in the mouth
Thinkin' payback is the best sport, I'm so tired
And my patience is a bit short, but I'm alive, listen
I don't like your reasons, she don't like to reason
She thinks 'cause man don't cry, that man ain't got no feelings
She's showing she loves him, he doesn't believe her
He's showing he loves her, she doesn't believe him
Bad communication, killin' off the evening
This isn't the way man really wants to leave things
I'll just come back afterwards
I'm just flabbergasted
It don't matter who's the closest, or who's the furtherest
You gotta trust the process
It's educational, and we won't stop
Until the wealth's generational
Man ran up and took a swing and hit a baseball
You can hate on the ting but that's disgraceful
I'm a ninja, and she's April
I'm just playin' with them, I'm just playful, yo, listen
