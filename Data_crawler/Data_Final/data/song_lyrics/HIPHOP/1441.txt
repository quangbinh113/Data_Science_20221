Song Name: Massive
I've been alone in my thoughts
Can't fill this void between us
I cannot stand losing you, whoa-oh
All these feelings intertwined, oh
Fighting the urge to reach out
And my stance remains unchanged, baby
I can't help it, I'm so into you
Oh, when you're ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
'Cause I don't wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon' be lit 'cause of how I treated people
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna-
Swervin' between emotions
I know we got real issues
Can't give in so easily, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ain't going out with no fight, no
I'm just tryna play my part, yeah
I'm not ready to let go, whoa, whoa
Oh, when you're ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
'Cause I don't wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon' be lit 'cause of how I treated people
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna-
