Song Name: I'll Be Missing You (feat. Faith Evans & 112) - 2014 Remaster
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why?)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (Uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (Uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day

When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

I miss you Big
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in heaven smiling down (Eh, eh)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (Uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the siz, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death
Every step I take (Oh Lord)
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you (Yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Somebody tell me why?
On that morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take (Every day that passes)
(Is a day that I get closer) Every move I make
Every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, (We miss you Big), every step I take (And we won't stop)
Every move I make ('Cause we can't stop), every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, (We miss you Big) every single day
Every step I take (Oh no)
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you (Yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you (I'll be missing you)
Thinkin' of the day (Thinkin' of the day)
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Every step I take (On that morning)
Every move I make (When this life is over)
Every single day, every time I pray (I know)
I'll be missing you (I'll see your face)
Thinkin' of the day (On that morning)
