Hmmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Huh, hmm, da-da-da-da
Gotta drop up on the 'opps, man, I know where they be at
Bitch, I rob the plug, he was sellin' where he sleep at
Fell in love with these drugs, Percocets, I be fiendin'
And bitch I'm prayin' to the Lord but I'm livin' like a demon
I keep the glizzy on a nigga, man, I use it for protection
I snuck a Glock up in the club, don't you come up in my section
I got promoters really scared, every show we be reckless
Caution tape up on the on the murder scene, this shit can get deadly
I told my momma not to worry 'cause I'm livin' like a thug
And my mama keep on tellin' me to slow down on the drugs
So much pain in my body, can't make this shit up
I threw the dirt up on my own, with just me and my gloves
It just like a throwback, a nigga push yo' shit back
I don't fuck with the police, bitch I'm screamin', "Fuck the dispatch"
Put this hollow in your throat like a motherfuckin' Tic-Tac (huh)
This chopper break a nigga down like a fuckin' Kit-Kat (ha, ha)
High speed, the blue lights, we run from the coppers
I hit him with two, sent him straight to the doctor (the doctor)
I'm sonnin' these niggas, they callin' me "papa"
King of the jungle, they call me "Mufasa"
They say "Young Choppa, you ain't steppin'", man a nigga must be crazy
I wipe a nigga nose like a snotty-faced baby
Bitch, I still got it on me while a nigga on probation
And I'm screamin' "fuck the judge", and you know I'm beatin' cases (huh, fuck the judge)
Slippin', I'ma stick him up, bitch, give me everything
Bitch, I'm screamin' "Fuck love", I never buy a wedding ring
Same nigga from the East, nigga, I never change
Surgeon with this chopper, man, I'm tryna take a nigga brain
Last nigga play with me, I sent him to the Heaven gates
I ain't never fuck with Josh, but I love totin' Drac's
Bitch, I'm boutta get 'em wacked, then I move to another state
I got a bucket list for the 'opps, who I'm gonna kill today?
Everybody rise, kill my enemy then watch his mama cry (everybody rise, cry)
Everybody dies, I'm a demon in disguise, you can see it in my fuckin' eyes (everybody dies)
Mama say, "why did you grow up this way?" (grow up this way)
I was sitting up in court, I couldn't look at her face (look at her face)
I could never do it right, keep on makin' mistakes (mistakes)
Then I rose to the life from a sunken place (sunken place, yeah yeah)
Everybody rise, top shotta, don daughter (yeah)
Everybody dies, NLE the top shotta (got the Rolls)
Mama say, "Why did you grow up this way?"
I could never do it right, keep on makin' mistakes
Mama say, "Why did you grow up this way?"
