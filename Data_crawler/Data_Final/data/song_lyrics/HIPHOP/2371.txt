Song Name: then i met her
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
I've been thinking too much, too much
I got a lot on my mind
Wake up, I don't wanna do that half the time
And then I met her one night
And it all slows down
And it all slows down
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
Nothing makes me happy, happy
But when you knock on my door, I smile
I hope you can stay awhile
I hope you can stay
And it all slows down
And it all slows down
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
