Song Name: Red Beam (feat. Sean Kingston)
Hustle and motivation (yeah)
Goin' places you can't go, red beam like Kano, erupt like a volcano, yeah (yeah)
On a Pegasus like Django, baby, I see your halo (yeah)
She spread her wings like angels (angels)
In a Cullinan, it's lit, got pneumonia in my fist
All these diamonds on my wrist, yeah
You all so mad, man, you so pissed
Man, you know we on that shit
Let that chopper blow a kiss, yeah
Goin' places that you can't go (oh)
Who would ever thought that we would make it from the bando?
Remember I was dead broke 'cause I had my bands up
Shawty fronted on me, now she on it, but I cancelled
Never thought I'd see the day
That I'd be doin' shows in Norway
With a Cuban that's dancin' like MJ
We came a long way
Doors suicide, you don't want war, they gon' let it fly
Don't let no one take, take me alive (lighter)
Goin' places you can't go, red beam like Kano, erupt like a volcano, yeah (yeah)
On a Pegasus like Django, baby, I see your halo (yeah)
She spread her wings like angels (angels)
In a Cullinan, it's lit, got pneumonia in my fist
All these diamonds on my wrist, yeah
You all so mad, man, you so pissed
Man, you know we on that shit
Let that chopper blow a kiss, yeah
