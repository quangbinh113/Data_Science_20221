Song Name: Roll in Peace (feat. XXXTENTACION)
Aye, everything be like, off the top these days like
These days, I don't even know what a pad is these days, you know?
F- that hoe 'cause she a nat nat
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got sh- I need
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed
Maybe I'm out your league
You ain't even got no cheese
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus plead?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' ride for me
Baby that's blasphemy, yeah
Baby you're bad for me, yeah
Say you gon' clap for me, yeah
Say you gon' blast for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me, yeah
I was goin' through tragedy
I needed you drastically, yeah
I'ma just switch my flow up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no throw up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no check up, yeah
Boy, you need to run your check up, yeah
I'm eatin' on you n-, no ketchup, yeah
I'm eatin' on you n-, can't catch up, ayy
Hit her face down with her - up, ayy
Even when I'm f-ing, I'm masked up, ayy
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got sh- I need
You want me to take my time with you
Well, maybe I'm not your speed
Maybe I'm out your league
You ain't even got no cheese
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus plead?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (what?)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
And you say that you gon' ride for me
I ain't gon' do the n- sh- 'cause I'm too good for features, huh
I ain't gon' f- your n- b- 'cause I know she a eater, huh
Last time I wifed a b-, told the world I beat her, huh
When they locked Lil Kodak up, my n-, I couldn't believe it, huh
Ayy lil' shorty, pop my whoady
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking yuh
Hit her from the back, damn that bi- bleeding
Said I knocked her period on
Remember when I had that poker, huh
Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forcing with a n-, no Yoda
That mean a young n- got what on me?
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got sh- I need (yo)
You want me to take my time with you
Well, maybe I'm not your speed (yo)
Maybe I'm out your league
You ain't even got no cheese
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus plead?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You say that you gon' ride for me, ayy
I'm in London, got my beat from London
