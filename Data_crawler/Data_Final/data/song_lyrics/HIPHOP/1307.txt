Song Name: BLUE MOON (feat. Teddi Jones)
And I don't wanna waste your time
I don't, I really don't
And I don't wanna waste your time
Let's go
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
Even when there's a blue moon, pretty lady, pretty lady
I'll see you on the twelfth of June, pretty lady, pretty lady
Don't you cry, I'm comin' soon
I need to go back home, so I can rest my soul and heart alone
(Pretty lady, pretty lady)
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
I guess, it's just
I'm upset, tough luck
You're my baby, baby, baby
Things have been so crazy, crazy
A mess, with us
I wonder if it's all worth the things we've been through
You're my baby, baby, baby
I'll always be your lady, lady, lady
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
Even when there's a blue moon, pretty lady, pretty lady
I'll see you on the twelfth of June, pretty lady, pretty lady
Don't you cry, I'm comin' soon
I need to go back home, so I can rest my soul and heart alone
