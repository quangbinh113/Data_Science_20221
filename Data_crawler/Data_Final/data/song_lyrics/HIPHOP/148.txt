Song Name: Blink 182
All the, small things
Balmain, ripped jeans
Conver-sations
I want back what you wasted
Always, I know
You'll be, a lil hoe
Watch me, pree me
Text me back that you need me
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off
Watch on my glow
Watch on my wrist
Bling on my phone
If this the last call
I will not go
Na na na na na na
I will not go
Na na na na na na
I will not go
I don't give no fucks
Mud in my cup
Pull up in the cut
Fuck all your love
Fuck off my phone
Flex on my ex
She done cut me up and put blood on my kicks
And every time you talk I ain't tryna hear shit
Ice in my heart now I don't feel shit
Got a few baddies still plottin' on me
Girl, my ears broke so I gotta get my bands up
T-dot out to Kansas
Down in Calabasas, V-Town where I land up
Said I might just cause some ransom
Said you need some space, I'm out here like it's NASA
Fuckin' on that shordy she the baddest
Deep in that bitch, she in Atlantis
Could've been roamin' round the atlas
Fuck what happened? Thought we was lastin'
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off
Watch on my glow
Watch on my wrist
Bling on my phone
If this the last call
I will not go
Na na na na na na
I will not go
Na na na na na na
I will not go
Na na na na na na
