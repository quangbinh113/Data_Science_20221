Song Name: Big Momma Thang
You got it goin' on, wha', wha'
Uh, wha', wha'
You got it goin' on, wha', wha'
Uh, wha', wha'
You got it goin' on, wha', wha'
Uh, wha', wha'
You got it goin' on, wha', wha'
I used to be scared of the dick
Now I throw lips to the shit
Handle it like a real bitch
Heather Hunter, Janet Jacme
Take it in the butt, yah, yazz wha'
I got land in Switzerland, even got sand in the Marylands
Bahamas in the spring, baby, it's a Big Momma thing
Can't tell by the diamonds in my rings
That's how many times I wanna cum, 21
And another one, and another one, and another one
24-karats nigga
That's when I'm fuckin' with the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me, and oh
Don't you like the way I roll?
And play with my bushy
Tell me what's on your mind when your tongues in the pussy
Is it marriage? (Damn, this bitch is bad)
Baby carriage? (Damn, I love that ass)
Shit no, on a dime shit is mine
Got to keep 'em comin' all the time (why?
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why you're mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why you're mad at me
How B.I.G. and 'Un' trust you in the studio with me
Don't they know I'm tryin' to sex you continuously
Pull a high power coup make, you jump ship
Leave who you with, I'm with the Roc-A-Fella crew
Trick you for the cheese, tear your boom up
Spread a ill Boomer, make you flip on Little Ceas
Pushin' backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Little Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and B.I.G. know it
He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat
But I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm just tryin' to eat
Horizontally, the way I hold my iron, sweet
And, no, my niggas, but I like the sound
Lil' Kim and Jigga, it sound like figures
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Before I caught some nigga's disease, got caught with his keys
B.I.G. scooped a young bitch off her knees
Threw me at high priced Beam's
Face on tv's, platinum CD's
Shit, I never thought
It's on nigga, wha', pussy greased up
Stack the g's up, keeps the knees up
What the fuck? Stay fillin', half a mill'n
Geneva Diva, yeah, I throws it down
Lay around, clown the clock stops for no one
Never 68 and owe 1, takes one to know one
Better off wit the Playboy magazines uh, fuckin' with the Don
Push the keys, G's threes for pape's
Yeah, I ride crate state to state
Lieutenant takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you daydream and whine, I just keep gettin' mine
And I'm married to this
Ya'll strategy misses still plannin' weddin's
M.A.F.I.A. also deadens all the bullshit
Any type of threatens to pull shit, uh
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but you can't be
That's why your mad at me
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring...
