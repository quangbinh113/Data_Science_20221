It's crazy, you're still pretty when you cry

She want that thug love, yeah
But this ain't no fucking love song
It's crazy you're still pretty when you cry
Push your panty strings over to the side
Gon' wake up and hit it, why you got your thong on? Yeah
You tellin' me that you want thug love
But you don't even kiss me when we making love
And that's how I knew that you was a dog
I cannot blame you
I can't even lie, I was the same, too
I might be the reason, yeah, I changed you
Girl, I never meant to play you
Now you don't trust niggas (Trust niggas)
The same way I don't trust bitches (Trust bitches)

But I can get you stuck, man, fuck is you thinking, nigga?
Shooting like a Jumpman, 23 'em, yeah, yeah
Okay, yeah, that's Boogie in your nightmares
Yeah, okay, I used to bust juggs with my right hand
Yeah, okay, I used to bag it up with my left hand
To this day I never read the Bible so I might sin, yeah
Okay, yeah, that's Boogie in your nightmares
I ain't wanna be a pain, never do it right, yeah
I just hope my daughter never meet a nigga like me
'Cause I swear I already know that nigga's grimy
Yeah, that's how I feel, nigga
I fucked a lot of niggas' bitches and they still with 'em
And all the niggas that's with me, they was there since lil' niggas
And they the type to go catch a body and not tell niggas
But it's so hard to tell, though

Bought her Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Tom Ford, yeah
But you say you want thug love (Say you want thug love)
But this ain't no fucking love song
Yeah, yeah (Ain't no fuckin' love song)

Pullin' on your panty strings, put 'em to the side, oh
