Song Name: Closed On Sunday
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you get daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more living for the culture, we nobody's slave
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice stepping onto my land
I draw the line that's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Nah, back up off my family, move yo hands
I got my weapons in the Spirit's land
Ah, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Chick-fil-A
