Song Name: Waves
Everything Foreign
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
Every move I make, I glist (glist)
Ice my neck and wrist (ice)
D&G down to the kicks (D&G)
Made your hoe send me a flick (yeah)
On a light day, I'm throwin' a nick' (yeah)
She wan' show me her ass and tits (ass and tits)
I used to sell bags of grits
Hit me back on the first to the fifth (the first to the fifth)
Fuckin' a bag up at Fifths
I run through a ten again (again)
I roll in the Maybach Benz (Benz)
Or the coupe, it just really depends ('pends)
You can see this Tom Ford on my lens (my lens)
I'm pourin' a four of this red (red)
I'ma fuck her to sleep on this X
I'll fill a fuck nigga with lead (young Gunna)
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
All my style Louis V, think she smokin' for free
Bitch, these pounds wasn't cheap
Contract killers lay you down for a fee
Glock go, "Baow", rest in peace
He get found in the streets
They get wild with that heat
Uh, X7, sports truck, i8, doors up
Dirty Sprite, pourin' up
Only drop a four and up
They ain't steppin' more than us
Slid through they block and tore it up
My lil' sniper like KD, gon' pass somethin', he scorin' clutch
All night off X pills in traffic, they goin' nuts
Servin' out the backdoor 'cause the trap windows boarded up
Don't think it's sweet 'cause I rap, though, got a gun store on the tour bus
Like an encore, we gon' clap more, a lil' ten shot won't do enough
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
Jumped off the porch (porch)
Plush two-door Porsche (plush)
Got vibes in New York (vibes in New York)
Got stars in the Royce (stars in the Royce)
My style is Dior (Dior)
Got wild freaky whores (wild freaky whores)
Keep Codeine to pour (to pour)
The wave with no shore (wave)
