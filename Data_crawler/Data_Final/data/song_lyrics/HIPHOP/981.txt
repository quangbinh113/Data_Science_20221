Song Name: Like Me (feat. iann dior)
Okay
Yeah, ayy
Like this, like that, yeah
Like this, like that
Everybody tryna be like me (huh)
Tryna take my juice, tryna take my steez (ayy)
Everywhere I go, I'ma stay on my Qs and Ps
Everybody tryna be just like me
Choppa on my side and I might let it sing
Woah, that's my queen (yeah)
Bullet hit your dome with a lil' earring (brr)
Bullet hit your dome with a lil' earring (yeah)
You my baby girl, but you not main squeeze (ayy)
Clips for the stick and I might just squeeze
Glocks with the scope with the infrared beams
Fuck a bitch, then I dip, adi√≥s, peace
Three shots to the back, give me five rings
Gotta get the work so I pull up big body (big body)
Pull up in a foreign, I ain't talkin' Maserati (vroom)
Pull up in a 'Rari
I be eatin' good, I be eatin' calamari
I might break a bone, call me fuckin' Jeff Hardy
Two wheels, one seat, 'bout to rob a Harley
She knows what I need
Ridin' around as I please (huh)
Fuckin' everything up until I can't see
(I can't see)
Like this, like that
Everybody tryna be like me (huh)
Tryna take my juice, tryna take my steez (ayy)
Everywhere I go, I'ma stay on my Qs and Ps
Everybody tryna be just like me
Choppa on my side and I might let it sing (huh)
Woah, that's my queen (yeah)
Bullet hit your dome with a lil' earring (brr)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, get like me
Suicide doors and the inside green
Like, woah, woah, woah, woah (woo), high speed
I'ma hit the gas, I don't even need the keys (yeah)
I'ma pay in cash, I ain't talkin' 'bout a lease
Like a pair of dirty sneakers, yeah, I know that she a beater
I'ma hit it one time, you know I ain't tryna keep her
And I know that they be plottin' so I'm walkin' with a nina
Okay, girl, won't you put on a show for me?
I'm lovin' the way that she throwin' it back on me
She get the pat-down
Told her, "Bring it up, baby, bring it back down" (down)
Swingin' 'round, baby, throw it in circles (circles)
All these racks got her jumpin' like a hurdle (yeah)
Like a hurdle
Like this, like that
Everybody tryna be like me (huh)
Tryna take my juice, tryna take my steez (ayy)
Everywhere I go, I'ma stay on my Qs and Ps
Everybody tryna be just like me
Choppa on my side and I might let it sing (huh)
Woah, that's my queen (yeah)
Bullet hit your dome with a lil' earring (brr)
