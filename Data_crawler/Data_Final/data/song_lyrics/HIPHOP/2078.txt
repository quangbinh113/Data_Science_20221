Song Name: Ready or Not
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And make you want me
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And make you want me
Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, frontin' niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And take it slowly
You can't run away
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey, baby
'Cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know, oh baby, hey, baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no
Ready or not, refugees takin' over
The Buffalo soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the 12th hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die (he's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff la, with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (yes, sir)
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide (ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you
And take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide (ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you
And make you want me
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide (you know the)
Gonna find you
And take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And make you want me
