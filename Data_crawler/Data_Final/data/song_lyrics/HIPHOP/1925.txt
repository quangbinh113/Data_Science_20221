Song Name: Hard in Da Paint
Lex Luger
That nigga Lex Luger
Flocka!
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stanking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say (Brick Squad!)
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the town with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga (Flocka!)
Got a main bitch (And?), got a mistress (What else?)
A couple girlfriends, I'm so hood-rich
Keep my dick hard (Yeah) and keep me smoking
You'll get bills free, shawty, no joking (Real talk)
And what I stand for? (Flocka!) Brick Squad (Brick Squad)
I'ma die for this shawty, man, I swear to God
In the trap with some killers and some hood niggas
Where you at? Where you trap? You ain't hood, nigga (Baow!)
Keep this shit 300, put that shit on my hood (Flocka)
Crips fucking with me, G's and the Vice Lords (Brrrrrrr)
Es√© and amigos freestyle off the dome
Brick Squad, Waka Flocka Flame is fucking home (Flocka!)
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stanking, nigga, what the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say (Brick Squad)
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the town with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga
What's up, pussy nigga? (What's up?)
What's up, punk nigga? (What's up?)
Black out on that nigga, make your momma's momma miss you
Hope you got your killers with you
Hope you got your niggas with you
Hope your goons riding with you
They gon' fucking miss you, nigga
Nigga with a attitude like Eaze and Cube
When my little brother died, I said, "Fuck school!"
I picked the burner up, then I grabbed some marijuana
Two years later, screaming, "Now I'm here, your honor!"
Glock 9, the SK, if you want to beef
Shawty, point blank range, I'll put your ass to sleep
Shawty, talk is cheap, so watch what you say
Broad day in the air like this shit legal (Flocka!)
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stanking, nigga, what the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say (Brick Squad)
Front yard, broad day with the SK (Bow-bow-bow-bow-baow!)
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the town with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga
Flocka, Waka
Waka, Waka, Waka (Flocka)
Waka, Waka, Waka (Flocka)
Flocka, Flocka, Flocka (Waka)
Waka, Waka, Waka (Flocka)
Waka Flocka, Flocka (Waka)
Waka Flocka Flame, Brick Squad!
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, Brick Squad
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, Brick Squad
Yuh, Flocka!
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stanking, nigga, what the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say (Brick Squad!)
Front yard, broad day with the SK (Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-baow!)
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the town with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga (Flocka!)
