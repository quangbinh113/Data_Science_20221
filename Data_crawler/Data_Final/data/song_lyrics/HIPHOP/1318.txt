Song Name: Greed (feat. Lil Yachty)
I hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
All that greed, you should kill yourself
All that greed, you should, uh, ayy
All that greed, you should kill yourself
Big geeked boy, I'ma heal myself
Another high-speed and she still ain't ate
Sex, money, drugs, I can't feel my face
Big broke heart in the VIP
Drive so fast, we don't need IDs
Ho so pretty and she still gon' bake
Another high-speed and she still ain't ate
All that greed, you gon' fit right in
Took a lil' break, now I'm back, pop a ten
Super charged Tune, they gon' hear it's me
Burn this bitch down like literally
Put a bad bitch in a DDT
50K earring, nothing cheap
Bitch and her friend wanna buy me Chrome
Sitting back feeling like a P-I-M-P
Remember when niggas'd just give me hell
Rockin' big clothes like it's 2003
Pull up, 650, not G63
Have a cookout, everybody get smoke
Niggas going through it, code green like a lima bean
UK bitches tooted up off of ketamine
Turn him to a pack, leave him stuffed like a figurine
Nigga think he fly? We gon' give that boy a set of wings
Four in the two, shoot-shoot, that's the regiment
My jeweler just made a light like he Edison
Pussy grip tight on the finger like a wedding band
Drop a new clip in the Glock, got sleight of hand (ayy, ayy, ayy)
All that greed, you should kill yourself
Big geeked boy, I'ma heal myself
Another high-speed and she still ain't ate
Sex, money, drugs, I can't feel my face
Big broke heart in the VIP
Drive so fast, we don't need IDs
Ho so pretty and she still gon' bake
Another high-speed and she still ain't ate
