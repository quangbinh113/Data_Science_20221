Song Name: Can I Get A... - From The Rush Hour Soundtrack
I wanna go back 98
Maybe go back 96
Couple a hits
Help me out yo
Bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me
Left side can you bounce with me with me
Right side can you bounce with me
In the middle can you bounce with me
Help me out
Without givin you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you WANT ME?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond rings bitches KILL FOR
Would you STILL ROLL?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
Would you RIDE THEN, if I wasn't DROPPIN?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
See yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a BALLA? So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all of my thugs who don't love those that get no dough
Can I get a (whoop Whoop)
To all of my ladies, uh, aha
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all of my players who don't love those that got no dough
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
Now can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Bounce bounce bounce
