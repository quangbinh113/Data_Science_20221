Song Name: Man in the Mirror
Got it on Smash
OG Parker
Huh, she whisperin' all in my ear
I'm thinkin' 'bout what I should wear
Any appearance, I'm pullin' up fly
Even if it's no cameras there
I don't own a Benz, I swear
'Raris and Lambs, I swear
My life is a movie, my wrist is a chandelier
Started gettin' my bands up, in the mansions
Livin' like I'm the prince of Bel-Air
Do not come over here lookin' for love anymore
'Cause that shit don't belong in here
You told me, "Go to hell", 'cause I was drivin' you crazy
Bitch, I would drive you there
Why would I need a stylist to pick out an outfit for me?
I got mad gear
Yeah, stackin' up money like Jenga and Legos
I sing, but I came with a Glock and a Draco
Back of the crib, look like mini Barbados
Losin' my friends everyday, I'm okay though
It's been that way ever since I got famous
We go back like two flats on a Maybach
Money got niggas thinkin' I changed
Oh, you makin' this so complicated
I could buy you a new ass, just say that
Birkins and Tiffany bags, okay then
Still got bitches that owe me some favours
Know a young nigga got racks, baby
Diamonds go blue, like the Mavs, okay then
They can't make my sauce, I got too much flavour
No overexaggeratin'
Don't feel embarrassed, I was flippin' your bitch in the air
50 on the veneers, could've bought like a hundred Monclers
I can't even sleep, the thirties be helpin' me concentrate
She throwin' it back
In the back of my mind, I'm like, "What if the condom break?"
Huh, she whisperin' all in my ear
I'm thinkin' 'bout what I should wear
Any appearance, I'm pullin' up fly
Even if it's no cameras there
I don't own a Benz, I swear
'Raris and Lambs, I swear
My life is a movie, my wrist is a chandelier
Started gettin' my bands up, in the mansions
Livin' like I'm the prince of Bel-Air
Do not come over here lookin' for love anymore
'Cause that shit don't belong in here
You told me, "Go to hell", 'cause I was drivin' you crazy
Bitch, I would drive you there
Why would I need a stylist to pick out an outfit for me?
I got mad gear
I look at the man in the mirror, he was wearin' a hoodie
I look at my shirt and that's not what I'm wearin', it's scary
Got a beach full of sand
I drive in the city like Fast and The Furious
With a tank in the Urus
It's already one up in this .30, I swear
If I see a opp, then I put that on Blood, I'm airin'
Mm, used to wear Michael Kors
Now I got porcelain floors, she told me, "It's yours" (mhm)
It's just me and your baby girl, she was rockin' my world (mhm)
VVSs and pearls, keep me up 'til she 'url (mhm)
Started gettin' my bands up, in the mansions
Livin' like I'm the prince of Bel-Air
Do not come over here lookin' for love anymore
'Cause that shit don't belong in here
You told me, "Go to hell", 'cause I was drivin' you crazy
Bitch, I would drive you there
Why would I need a stylist to pick out an outfit for me?
I got mad gear
Huh, she whisperin' all in my ear
I'm thinkin' 'bout what I should wear
Any appearance, I'm pullin' up fly
Even if it's no cameras there
I don't own a Benz, I swear
'Raris and Lambs, I swear
My life is a movie, my wrist is a chandelier
Started gettin' my bands up, in the mansions
Feelin' like I'm the prince of Bel-Air
Please don't knock on my door lookin' for love
'Cause it don't belong in here
You told me to go to hell, okay, I would drive you there
I got mad gear
