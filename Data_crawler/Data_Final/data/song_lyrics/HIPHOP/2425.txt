Song Name: Speed Of Plight
Check, aye
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me
Missed another birthday, was shellin' overseas
Photo of police, on my road, belly of the beast
I've been hidden in the East so I'm on my p's and my q's
Trying to find a piece of my youth
'Cause on them late nights, we be gettin' bruised
The people wanna dance, they don't wanna hear the truth
They got no lovin' for no niggas on the news, sorry Alfa
But they won't listen if I sing the blues like a blood
Ayo we learned nothing from the crud
We just lost a lot of figures in city that we love
Yo it's bugged 'cause they be lookin' to above
And I'm like "bruv, look at what's in front of you
Look at what love can do, look how they corrupted you"
Trying to put trust in any others 'stead of trusting you
The world's moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me shit
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me shit
Aye, uh, is it only me? shit
I've still got this bad taste in my mouth
Still the most hated face in the South
I'm still trying to find a grace in my house
But I made it out, pickin' up the pace and I bounce
Aye, so shut your fuckin' mouth, yo I was living in a fuckin' drought
It's a wonder not one of us fuckin' drowned
Yeah they were walking past but wouldn't help a brother out
So I had to stack my money and make my mother proud
Nobody does it so I did it by myself
I see my brother's ashes sitting on my shelf, trust
Collecting dust but yo I didn't scream for help
Saw the championship running, I was coming for the belt
Yo I want it all, I want the money and the fame
The funny and the pain, want the summer in the rain
Yo I want it all, until there's nothing that remains
If I didn't make the currency, at least I made a change
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me, check shit
Aye, uh, is it only me? shit
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me shit
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me
Is the world moving fast for you as well?
Ayo I can't tell if it be only me shit
Aye, uh, is it only me?
