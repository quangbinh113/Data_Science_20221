Song Name: I'm Sprung
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
Ooh, she got me doin' the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man, she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well, it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
Ooh, so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feeling so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well, it all come down to her
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do)
You do (do, do, do, do, do)
Ooh, she got me doing what I won't do
Now you sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end you'll see that
She got you doing what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G, now you see
She got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
She got you
Got you
Got you
