Song Name: Gargoyle (feat. Swae Lee & Offset)
No
What lil' shawty, what lil' shawty say
Bitch, pop for 'em
Racks (racks), hey
There's a lot of money comin' round
What, yeah, yeah
Real diamonds
Yeah
You dig?
I'm a gargoyle (word)
Got 'em hard boiled (boiled)
Where this popcorn? (Pop)
I'm on top floors (hey)
Bitch, I'm country (top, top, top)
I mean Tom Sawyer
Black on black mirror (yeah)
That is charcoal
That's the damn fight
In the damn sauna (sauna)
She's a lawn mover
I just John Doe'd her (yo)
I'm a leaf blower
Corral reef goer (goer)
Where them bad bitches? (Yeah)
Tell 'em come forth (forth)
Stampin' passports (stampin')
Livin' fast forward (fast, fast)
Pull that Drac', don't measure (measure)
Told her, dick, don't mention it
Got no recollection
Keep that bread like breadsticks (bread)
Drop them bags, I'm rushin'
I'm fucked up from pushin' (yo)
Bring your sister with you
Please don't take no pictures (bitch)
Why my diamonds dancin'? (Huh)
Michael Jackson, Thriller
Thr-thr-through the dashboard (skrrt)
I paid cash for it (racks)
Your bitch asked for it (your bitch)
You brought her back boy (back)
Drop-rop-droppin' the top of my coupe (skrrt)
I make a lick for the roof (huh)
Fuck her, but you call her boo
Not one watch on, got two (got two)
I work hard for it
Make a movie, get your popcorn
Whippin' babies like a newborn (whip)
Countin' them racks so I'm up in the morning (rich)
I'm a gargoyle (word)
Got 'em hard boiled
Where this popcorn? (Pop)
I'm on top floors (hey)
Bitch, I'm country (top)
I mean Tom Sawyer
Black on black mirror (woo, woo, woo)
That is charcoal (Offset)
My coupe a gargoyle
Trapper got a knife like a samurai sword (ah)
25 thots on the yacht, all aboard (thots)
Runnin' at the charts, get the bag on fours (run it up)
We 'bout the night, fuck, get out the spot (spot)
We 'bout to find up, pussy nigga die (die)
You bombaclat, talk a lot, get shot (shot)
Black Lamborghini, Molly Rock, oh my (hey)
Hoppin' in my Bentley, give me top, why not? (Why not?)
Yeah, we got them sticks, we chop (chopsticks)
Hold up, we 'bout to go and blister up (blis')
Plain, two fifths on a watch (plain)
Get my spot (get it)
Niggas can't get my spot (no, brrr)
Birds gon' flock (brrr)
I just had surgery on the lot (surgery)
White like Andy Milonakis (white, white)
Twisters tucked in my crotch (twisters)
Stitch right there in the couch, ooh (right there)
Pushed down a bando house (hey)
Don't step down like a mouse, ooh (steppin' on it)
I got more water than a cloud (water)
Invite your daughter to the house (daughter)
I'ma get in there, put the bitch out (get out, hey)
I'm a gargoyle (word)
Got 'em hard boiled
Where this popcorn? (Pop)
I'm on top floors (hey)
Bitch, I'm country (top)
I mean Tom Sawyer
Black on black mirror (yeah)
That is charcoal
I'm a gargoyle (word)
Got 'em hard boiled
Where this popcorn? (Pop)
I'm on top floors (hey)
Bitch, I'm country (top)
I mean Tom Sawyer
Black on black mirror (yeah)
That is charcoal
