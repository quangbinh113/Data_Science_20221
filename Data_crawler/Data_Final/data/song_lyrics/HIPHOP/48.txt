Song Name: How You Feel
Haven't smiled in a while
But yesterday was too wild
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
If you were here, be so proud
All my thoughts are so piled
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
I'm tryna pour my heart out
How the fuck I'm 'posed to sound?
I guess I'm tryna know how, how you feel
Like cookies to a girl scout
A nobody, a mushmouth
I guess I'm tryna know how, how you feel
How you feel
How you feeling about me, feel
How you feeling about me, feel
How you feeling about me, feel
How you feeling about me
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Ooh-woah (how you feel about,
How you feel, how you feel about me, how you feel)
How you feelin', how you feelin',
How you feelin'(how you feel about me, how you feel)
How you feelin', how you feelin', how you feelin'-in'
Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Ooh-ooh (how you feel about me,

How you feel, how you feel about me, how you feel)
Haven't smiled in a while
But yesterday was too wild
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
If you were here, be so proud
All my thoughts are so piled
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
I'm tryna pour my heart out
How the fuck I'm 'posed to sound?
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
