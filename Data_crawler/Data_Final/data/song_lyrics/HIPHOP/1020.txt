Song Name: [The Jackie] (with J. Cole & Lil Tjay)
You good, T-Minus?
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
I'm on the way, send me the addy
I'm on the Jackie
Five on the belt, ten on the jacket
You gotta have me
It's been a day, I don't wanna wait no more
Why the fuck are we waitin'? I don't wanna wait no more
I know a couple niggas had you
I ain't trippin', they ain't fuckin' with me
Know niggas on your block aggie
But them niggas don't mean nothin' to me
Hopped out, double parked, all them niggas watchin'
Copped a rubber from the ahk
Hit your crib and got it poppin', eeh
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
I know she 'bout it, it ain't mine but you fuckin' I doubt it
She saw me, that's why her nigga re-routed
I'm a rich nigga, no, I ain't clouted
Lovable, I'm a young and I'm bossed up
It's a difference, don't let it get crossed out
I was 17 comin' through poor stuff
Now it's Bentley truck, AMG, more stuff
She a dime so her DM be crowded
Now she fuckin' Lil T, yeah, he stylish
Ain't gon' say that lil' bitch ain't got mileage
But we ain't challenged, it ain't no challenge like, yeah
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
I'm lettin' you know, I gotta stay down on the road
I'm lettin' you know, she gotta lock down while I'm gone
We don't do average shit, I got a magic stick, can't you see?
Whole lot of lavish shit, used to not havin' shit, no, no, no
Slide in that bitch with my Gucci's on, just tryna stay out the way
Money get made when I sleep, I don't get nothin' for free
I had some Dior slippers, I don't know what I did with 'em
Bret Hart when I'm sharpshootin'
I applied for them M's and you know I got 'em
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
You see the drop top, bitch, stop playin' with me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
She said she wanna let the waves splash down on me
Aye, aye
