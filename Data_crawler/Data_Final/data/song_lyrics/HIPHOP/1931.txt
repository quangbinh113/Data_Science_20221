Song Name: Grove St. Party (feat. Kebo Gotti)
Grove Street, Flocka!
I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin'
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
I step in the club, rolling up that loud shit
My weed keep your security sayin' be quiet
My bread startin' a riot, your girl gettin' excited
Hold on wanna try it, I'm like why not try it
My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Club goin' stupid, when I O Let's Do It
You ain't gotta chew it, jukin' and she movin'
Grove Street villain nigga who you killin'?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceilin', that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm rollin', throwin' up the mean bread
Now I'm 'bout to meet her in the club with a heater
I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin'
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
A party ain't a party 'til I walk in it
Lime green flap match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kinda tinted
Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinnin'
I'm rollin' like a mothafucka, I'm a roll out in this mothafucka
I'm Roscoe Dash it, I'mma 'bout to show out in this mothafucka
My jewelry game on frost about to snow out in this mothafucka
Ay Flocka get them burners let's pull out in this mothafucka
Ay mothafucka what the hell is you rockin' for?
Run up on me and my squad, no that shouldn't be an option so
Somebody better let you know I suggest that you let it go
This is Grove Street party safe niggas hit the exit door
I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin'
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
Rollin' on them leaves, you can do the lean
Blowin' on that loud perp, pass that Bobby Brown back
The hood got my fuckin' back, the streets I'm not duckin' that
Please step the fuck back, Grove Street yes we are back
Hood plus I'm legal rich, every ghetto feelin' this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist
100 on my neck iced out for my respect
20 fuckin' 10, I'mma blow the whole check
In the club flex, after party flex
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket I'mma spend it all
When a nigga die, they gon' say shawty raw
I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin'
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
