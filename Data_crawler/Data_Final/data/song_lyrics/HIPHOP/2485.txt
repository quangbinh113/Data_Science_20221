Song Name: Eat It
Bitch, it's Young Tina Snow, the nastiest freak you know
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
Bust through the walls, break in and enter
How many licks 'til you get to the center?
How many times have I heard that a nigga a dog
But scared when he play with the kitten?
How many times have I heard that somebody last long?
These niggas ain't lastin' a minute (lastin' a minute)
How many times have I heard that a nigga was big
But dick as small as an egg-shaker? (Hahaha)
Legs shaking, hit it 'til the bed breaking ('til the bed breaking)
