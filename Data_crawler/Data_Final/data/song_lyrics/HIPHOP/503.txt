Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl
Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl
Yeah

I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
Yeah
Yeah, that's my baby
Matchin' Mercedes
Don't ever play me, baby
Because you the world
Don't ever play me, baby
Because we in love
Would've did it all for you
But you couldn't hold it down
Tried to give my love to you
But you were playing 'round
Would've gave my earth to you
But yours was flat, mine's round
Round
Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl
Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl
Yeah
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl (Never leave you girl)
I can never leave you, girl (I could never, could never)
Yeah (I could never, could never)
Baby, you my world (Yuh)
You stay through thick and thin, because you thorough
I like to treat you 'cause you sweeter than a churro (A churro)
Hit your technician, get a paint job like you Dorrough (Like you Dorrough)
And you an angel, can I please get a referral?
Meet me in Heaven, I need more than just a mural
Meet me in Heaven, this is more than I had planned
'Cause you mean something
I need something that's eternal (Eternal)
This big ol' planet, I am nothing more than man
You see the hate and that's big cap, that's big sombrero
They see you out, you dripped out, Burberry apparel
You hit your dance, you hit your two step, hit your Euro
(You hit your Euro)
Baby
Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl

Shawty, you complete my world
I can never leave you, girl
Drive me to the edge of the world
Drive me crazy, Ms. Pearl
Yeah
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
I can never leave you, girl
Yeah
I love you, I am sorry about last night
I got heated and I don't feel too good and I'm going to sleep
I'll be here all night so, um
Yeah, just let me know what you're on, bub
