Song Name: Novacane
I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did-didn't, I can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin', Viagra poppin'
Every single record, autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip
Perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying for tuition doing porn in the Valley
At least you working
But girl I can't feel my face
What are we smokin' anyway?
She said don't let the high go to waste
But can you taste a little taste
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast
Yikes
Bed full of women
Flip on a tripod, little red light on
Shooting, I'm feeling like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget you
You put me on a feeling I never had, never had, never had (never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway?
She said don't let the high go to waste
But can you taste a little taste?
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain
Novacane, Novacane
Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me, pretty, pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me, pretty, pity, pity
I can't feel a thing,
I can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, Novacane, Novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel, feel her, feel her
Novacane, Novacane, cane, cane, cane
