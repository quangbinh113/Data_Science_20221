Song Name: Bulletproof Maybach (feat. Offset)
Forges on the Lambo, we got cameras on the mantle
Forges on the Lambo, we got cameras on the mantle
Backseat of the Phantom, this the mob just like Sopranos
Hot just like a candle, we had opps and I bought ammo
We got Glocks and you get popped, life a gamble
Bulletproof Maybach, chopper on the seat
Chopper like Ajax cleaning up the streets
If you smoke, get your payback and keep it in the streets
Hundred thousand needs, Virgil on the feet
Make out with the Draco, make love when you bleed
Diamonds big ol' karats, making Bugs Bunny freeze
I put my cause on the team
RIP the pistol, we was thugs on the scene
Blood, sweat and tears, I been grinding shit for years
I done popped another pill, I'm tryna keep my temper chill
Put that money to my ear 'cause only racks is what I hear
Only God is who I fear and I need equity and deals
PJ flying in the G5
Thinkin' 'bout the shit I was gonna do with the money when I was knee high
Shit get serious, T.I
Remember my nigga got killed 'cause he took that niggas .35
Investing all my bills, I was tryna get out the northside
I ain't told no lie
I been having .45
Go look she proud of me, I slow down
Bulletproof the president, you never know it go down
Living in the fast life, momma told me need to slow down
Forges on the Lambo, we got cameras on the mantle
Backseat of the Phantom, this the mob just like Sopranos
Hot just like a candle, we had opps and I bought ammo
We got Glocks and you get popped, life a gamble
Bulletproof Maybach, chopper on the seat
Chopper like Ajax cleaning up the streets
If you smoke, get your payback and keep it in the streets
Hundred thousand needs, Virgil on the feet
Make out with the Draco, make love when you bleed
Diamonds big ol' karats, making Bugs Bunny freeze
I put my cause on the team
RIP the pistol, we was thugs on the scene
Yeah, took a Tesla pill
I'm up like fuck, I need to rest for real
I know all these hoes wanna fuck 'cause I got sex appeal
Gotta keep a pole in the truck in case I gotta kill
Different way home when I cut, you know I got a meal
Catch me outside, I'm on my Dr. Phil
Heard you got a crib in your song but what you got for real?
I sleep where I own, look bruh, I got expensive bills
I be spending so damn much that my accountant losing count
I got bitches on my dick that's tryna fuck with me for clout
I need backup 'fore I walk up in this club or bitch I'm out
Too much jewelry in my room, I'm just gon' fuck her on my couch
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, yeah, I know
Why my ex keep speaking on me? 'Cause she know that I'm the GOAT
I be high but just off weed, these LA bitches be on coke
I be moving with security but still I wanna tote
I'ma benefit the people that don't fuck with me for me
Tryna sneak into my circle then they think that I don't peep
Bought Lamborghini, ya heard, that bitch faster than that Jeep
I make plays that last forever, I make money in my sleep
Niggas think shit sweet because the internet
Beefing over interviews for streams, can't get into that
Niggas really pussy when they see me, there ain't none of that
Niggas out here fiending for my bitch but you ain't touching that
I just came from Vegas, I just lost another fifty
At Beyonce party, I just chopped it up with Drizzy
Niggas say you switched up but I didn't, I'm just busy
Looking at these diamonds way too long will make me dizzy
