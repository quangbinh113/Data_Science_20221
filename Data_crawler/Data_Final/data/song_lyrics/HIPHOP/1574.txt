Song Name: One Time (with Don Toliver feat. Future)
You bought that drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I show you just who you are
You took a bite at the bar
I guess it's right and it's wrong
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see (yeah)
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Think I'm in the ceilin' when you fuckin' with a star (star)
Girl, just drop a pin, I'm pullin' up to where you are (pullin' up)
Everything I get, it come with options 'cause I'm famous
Had a special moment, still can't tell you what her name is (yeah, oh)
Plug to your socket, let me be the one in charge (uh)
I could be your mirror, I could show you who you are
Can't be seen in public with you, I'm takin' a risk
Every time you use your phone, I think you bein' slick (oh)
Focus on the moment, don't know how long we'll live
I know that she goin', she got tats on her ribs
There's not a lot of people that can do what I did
Damn near suicidal, almost slit both my wrists
Soon as I pull up, it's just as fast as I'm gone (uh, uh)
I been goin' off, don't know how long I'll stay on
See it in your eyes, you wanna fuck me 'cause I'm lit
I'll let you decide, you gotta make it quick
You bought that drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I show you just who you are
You took a bite at the bar
I guess it's right and it's wrong
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see (yeah)
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Yeah
Pretty, bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Lucky, lucky charm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pressure made diamonds with icy
Maneuverin' through the trenches so swiftly
'Bout to bulletproof the chair, solitary
Covered up in chinchillas, it's not LV
All these diamonds on me curb, bitch, vaccine
One of one, I wanna put it on you, girl, rare breed
Tote a loaded fully auto, I'm fully aware of the envy
I'm goin' full throttle, hittin' the gas, no ignition
Pollution in the club, so I'm on drugs when I hit it
Like a VIP now, you can head on a mission
Gone off the screws, sixteen ounces of Wock'
Bitch a mermaid and she dripped out in water
I hit it and she pray to a nigga like a god
Cleanin' like a maid every time she give me mop
I know my swagger gotta always be up to par
Smash on this bitch, make money on my day off
Bitch a mermaid and she dripped out in water
I hit it and she pray to a nigga like a god
You bought that drink at the bar (yeah)
You wanna fuck in the car (you wanna fuck in the car)
I show you just who you are (I'll show you just what you are)
You took a bite at the bar (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I guess it's right and it's wrong
Yeah, I see (yeah, I see), yeah, I see (yeah, I see)
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me (for a nigga like me)
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one-time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me (Wheezy outta here)
