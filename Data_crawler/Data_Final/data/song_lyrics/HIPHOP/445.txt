Song Name: I'm A Star
Ay
How it feel to be the boss, let me find out
My team ballin', you look like you need a timeout
I'm a star in the clutch, I'ma shine out
Workin' hard, yeah I'm back on my grind now
Game on, took a loss but I stay strong
Super Bowl rings I just won the playoffs
Gotta go hard, I could never play soft
Giant in New York I run it back like Saquon
And I gotta win no matter what like
Fourth down, Hail Mary, no punts like
Every time I touchdown I gotta stunt
Randy Moss, yeah my number's going up
All these trophies, what do I need any more for?
Check the stats or you could check the scoreboard
Check the stats, Jay Critch, I'm the QB
Ran it up and then I went and got a new freezer
How it feel to be the boss let me find out
My team ballin', you look like you need a timeout
I'm a star in the clutch, I'ma shine out
Workin' hard, yeah I'm back on my grind now
Game on, took a loss but I stay strong
Super Bowl rings I just won the playoffs
Gotta go hard, I could never play soft
Giant in New York I run it back like Saquon
How it feel to be the boss let me find out
My team ballin', you look like you need a timeout
I'm a star in the clutch, I'ma shine out
Workin' hard, yeah I'm back on my grind now
Game on, took a loss but I stay strong
Super Bowl rings I just won the play offs
Gotta go hard, I could never play soft
Giant in New York I run it back like Saquon
If you ain't no winner then don't come round
On my way to another city, it's a touchdown
Andale, yeah I gotta get it in a rush now
Let 'em hate, try to knock me down but we got up now
You say that you ballin', keep it real though
Ay, why I never saw you in the field though
Ay, I make it look easy, it's a field goal
I've been grinding for a minute and I'm still goin'
How it feel to be the boss let me find out
My team ballin', you look like you need a timeout
I'm a star in the clutch, I'ma shine out
Workin' hard, yeah I'm back on my grind now
Game on, took a loss but I stay strong
Super Bowl rings I just won the playoffs
Gotta go hard, I could never play soft
Giant in New York I run it back like Saquon
How it feel to be the boss let me find out
My team ballin', you look like you need a timeout
I'm a star in the clutch, I'ma shine out
Workin' hard, yeah I'm back on my grind now
Game on, took a loss but I stay strong
Super Bowl rings I just won the playoffs
Gotta go hard, I could never play soft
Giant in New York I run it back like Saquon
