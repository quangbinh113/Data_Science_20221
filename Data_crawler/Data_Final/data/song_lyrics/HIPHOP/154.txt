Song Name: I donâ€™t let go
Yeah
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes
Watchin' from the outside
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes
Watching from the outside (Ayy!)
Thoughts is fucking verified
Let me know by a thottie mind
But I don't want her, 'cause I got a wife
Playing with the pen through the day and night
Play with the mind and the beat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Hey, yuh
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes
Watching from the outside
Sometimes I don't let go (Ayy!)
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes
Watching from the outside
Huh, she gettin' smoked like a bong, hm
Smoked like that song, hm
That's fire, that's my 'lone, hm
I got the dope in my sock, aw-yuh
She wanna grind on the rock, mhm
I pull up like a-mhm
She pull her arm out the hoop, mhm
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes
Watching from the outside
Sometimes I don't let go (Ayy!)
I shine, I shine, outta these walls
He's mad 'cause of your hoes (Yeah!)
Watching from the outside
