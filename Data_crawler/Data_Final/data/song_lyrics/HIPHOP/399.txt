Ayy, ayy
Little bitch, you ridin' niggas' dick like a bitch, damn
Little bitch, you ridin' niggas' dick like a bitch
I got, six brand new foreigns on my wrist
I got six Forgiatos on my fist
I got fifty foreign hoes on my dick
I'ma nut in all 'em hoes, let's have some chicks
Nigga tried to hit a lick and missed
Tried to run then I caught him like a fish
I'ma catch his ass with the whole clip
I'ma beat they ass up like Ron Artest
Pussy nigga ran like a Miss
I got your bitch up underwater tryna kiss
I'ma gon' and shit and take a piss
We done fucked her legs and fucked her face
I'm sellin' purple rain, RIP to Prince
When I was behind the fence they treated me like a prince
So much jewelry on, her pussy gettin' tense
1017's the ones you don't wanna diss
And you can never be like 'Wop you little snitch
You make me mad, I have a threesome with your bitch
I'm from Custer East Atlanta, yeah the 6
I make one brick turn to two, I know a trick
Don't walk and limp my chopper is my walkin' stick
Cash out on the whip I don't want no rent
VVS's hit under G-starr V-necks (yeah-yeah)
Chop the top off that Stringray Corvette (yeah)
Two bitches with me, they on molly, they on X (yeah)
Took my foreign to the club, pulled in a vip
Took some ho to the hotel, made 'em strip
She sucked me loose I had to give that bitch a tip (yeah-yeah)
Everybody smashed that ho, that bitch the realest (yeah-yeah)
Everybody got they passport ready to dip, Europe
UK 25, 000 dollars on a trip
I just-I just found out rats can use they lips (yeah)
I got, I got, I got me a thirty round clip
I got one in the hand, thirty one rounds on my hip (yeah)
Aye, okay, Lil Dora said I was born with a skill
My lawyer say it's guaranteed when he appeal (yeah)
I got a bad bitch wit' me and yeah she strip
Shake it, I tip
I sip, I dip (it's lit)
Grip, I drip
I killed, I
All I eat is lean no lie and pills (oh my God)
Put that, put that in my girl (straight up)
Makin' porno videos and takin' stills
Turn that, turn that to a film (drip)
Yeah anywhere we go (yeah)
I bring the snow
I fill your nose (straight up)
Ether, howdy my mamacita
Stay away Lucifer, she sexy in that all white beater (yeah)
Dynamite no whine up
Have you fly from India, have you fly from China
I won't feel you honestly, strap up for these nighters
Pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew
I'm in Vegas spinnin' Thugger with my chips
I can't love these bitches, fell in love the rip
I was doin' this shit just for my peers
I would put inside my blood, my sweat, my tears
Do this shit all on my own, don't need no deal
Diamonds flawless 'round my neck, gave me a chill
Lately I've been flyin' on them Lears
Flyin' cross the world, these bitches killin' me
Flood her bank account with bands cause she feelin' me
Nigga cash on delivery
If it's a snake on my clothes then it's double G
I don't like police hoes, ain't no cuffin' me
All my diamonds dancin' like they Bruce Lee
Check out my smile I got some new teeth
Pop a molly now I'm in the fuckin' air
Cloud nine and I'm smokin' like the fuckin' bear
We at the Clearport, you niggas never there
I wouldn't even care, lil bitch that's how it is
I do it for my fam, 20 racks on gifts
Bitch we blowin' gas, roll me up a spliff
Now what you think a young nigga grindin' for?
I sip it till I sleep, I might overdose
She made it out the hood and left that dope bowl
Get them bricks from my momma, she got truck loads
Fuck you mean you get it from your mammy hoe? Yeah
Diamonds all on my chin, diamonds all on my folk
Piercin' in my nose, diamond in my nose
Giuseppe open toes, diamonds on my toes
I just got a family pack of Jimmy Choos, damn
I just bought a chopper and I'm ready to use it, damn
I got a lot of bitches comin' by the twos
I got a lot of bitches, bomin' by the few
Big di-diamonds but we call 'em jewels
All these racks think I sell dog foods
I spend thousand on my fuckin' shoes
Pull up in this Ave, it cost the Christian Loubes
Nigga watch your mouth, we ain't fuckin' cool
Boy you sell the molly, that's a fuckin' fool
Take this shit out and shoot
