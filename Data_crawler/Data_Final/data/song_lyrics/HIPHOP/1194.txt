Song Name: Feel Alone
Smokin' this dope, relaxin'
I ain't gon' lie, bro, I came a long way
I was just thinkin' 'bout (relaxin')
Back in high school (Danny, I see you)
Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh, uh, uh
I pray this reefer help me get rid of my demons (uh-huh, uh, what?)
I pray this reefer help me get rid of my demons (uh-huh, uh, what?)
Uh, let's go
Stuck in my mind, oh yeah (what else?)
I'm in my prime, oh yeah (what else?)
Taking my time, oh yeah (what else?)
Even though everything feels so fast (uh-uh)
Losing my mind, but it's okay, it's fine
I'ma just keep gettin' high
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
I wonder if anybody knows
I wonder if anybody notices
When I get in my head and feel alone
No, I don't think nobody really notices (huh, yeah, yeah)
Life don't seem so fair, uh, uh, uh
Devil standing right, right there
Funny, you don't think I see you standing right there?
I guess I'm just too high to care (care)
Well, at least I fell in love, that's rare
She help me move my things from the Heartbreak Hotel
The wishing wells, love to splash
And I'm in the electric chair
Stuck in my mind, oh yeah
I'm in my prime, oh yeah
Taking my time, oh yeah
Even though everything feels so fast
Losing my mind, but it's okay, it's fine
I'ma just keep gettin' high
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone
Okay, I get it, I understand
There's people here to hold my hand
But what happens when, happens when
I can't comprehend someone holding my hand?
Numb the pain with the drank, what I spent? Five bands
A bunch of pills, Oxyco', spend another, five grand
But understand none of these drugs make the person I am
Sober up, I can, sorry, but I can't
Hope to see tomorrow, the potency of sorrows
I was thinking hopefully, maybe hopefully
There's some dopamine I could borrow
It's a long shot from the finish line (long shot)
So many obstacles in this life, life of mine (life of mine)
Yeah, stuck in my mind, oh yeah
I'm in my prime, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Taking my time, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Even though everything feels so fast (uh)
Losing my mind
But it's okay, it's fine (it's fine)
I'ma just keep gettin' high (yeah)
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights (yeah)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (there's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone
