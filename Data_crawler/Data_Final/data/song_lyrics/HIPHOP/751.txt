Song Name: How I Move (feat. Lil Baby)
Yeah, I really run it up
Yeah, I really run it up
Yeah, I really run it up
Yeah, I really run it up
Listen up, pluto (listen up, pluto)
I really run it up
Yeah, ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up them guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that gonja
I built for the commas
See, I put my name on this shit
Hold up, you (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I-
I really run it up, baby
If the topic is money, I'm coming up
She gon' talk to her pa without coming up
I'm the man in the front, you the runner-up
Really don't give a fuck, yeah
How I move, way I talk, they try pick it up
I can call when I want, she be pickin' up
Niggas bitchin' they really be switching up
Can't play no game, I got too much to lose
Want me to follow, I got somethin' to prove
Really still with no trace, I won't leave 'em a clue
And the truck it came red and I painted it blue
If it's me and my shorty, we hop in the coupe
My lil' youngins go crazy, they lovin' the crew
He handle business, can't wait to recoup
Pop me a Addy, try make me a movie
I can't stand still when my diamonds keep moving
Gave all my heart, tryna guide 'em to do it
Got partners who gon' try to guide 'em with music
Lil bro don't play 'round, if he got it, he use it
Go against us niggas, gotta be stupid
Ride 'round with the stick, how I gotta be movin'
Everyday lit how them commas be moving
This shit we'd be doing inside of a movie
I really run it up
Yeah, ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up them guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that gonja
I built for the commas
See, I put my name on this shit
Hold up, you (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch-
Hold up, you (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I-
Rollie don't tick but it got big rocks
Bands in the whip, do the dash from the cops
Chains looking bliss, with the pole on my hip
Let me go, I'm equipped, but don't bang with the opps (Ooh)
Pain to regret, but it's more than I get
Really made for this shit, money made, it don't stop
Say heaven sent, I was made for the flip
I was made for this shit and I bang for the block
Beemer, the Jag, and the Benz on the lot
Went and copped me a crib just to park all the drop
Fuck do you mean? I was lost in the drought (Ayy
Got the bag comin' in 'til the stars in our mouth (What?)
Money comin' in, so you know a nigga goin'
Dyin' with a flip, so you know a nigga throw it
Style ever since, in the game 'I'ma I get
Got no time for shit
Get the bag and you know it, bitch
I really run it up
Yeah, ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up them guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that gonja
I bang for the commas
See, I put my name on this shit
Hold up, you (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch-
Hold up, you, yeah
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch how I move (yeah)
You say they watch
