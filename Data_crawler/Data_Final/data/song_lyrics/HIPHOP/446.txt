Song Name: My Nigga
Mustard on the beat, hoe
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (my motherfucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
First thing first, I love all of my niggas
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, let me call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all my niggas
Some nigga smoke, smoke, some nigga drink, drink
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think
That's a nigga back up, they in the bucket lapped up
I got that act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch, no that ain't my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch, no, that ain't my nigga
Take a nigga case, shit, that's my nigga
Know him since I was 8, yeah, that's my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick pass with my nigga (my nigga)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (dope boys, my niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (It's the motherfucking world)
You know I'm down with the niggas down for me
I got two words for you, love and loyalty
It's me and my nigga trippin' on a half of bean
Then we used to hit up wall and buy everything we see
Me and my down ass nigga getting twisted
Nigga get to trippin' knock the gravy, out your biscuit
Jay know I fuck with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I'm like, "Hey, my nigga!"
Drink that act right by the case, my niggas
Drink the act right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty, tryna chase them figures
Who got the yopper? Who got the yola?
Don't matter, go figure
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (it's the motherfucking world)
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga sell cake, my nigga got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga we eatin', my nigga get a plate
And we're still hittin' licks, my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off a nigga shit with my nigga, my nigga
I fucked a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talking shit then he ain't my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga and I ain't goin' in, ain't tryna leave my nigga
Shawty seein' me and wanna leave with a nigga
But it wasn't enough room 'cause I came with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas
I need a set of wings 'cause I'm too fly, nigga
And I'm all about my business like a suit and tie, nigga
I ride for my niggas (believe that)
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grindin' outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (my motherfucking niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
