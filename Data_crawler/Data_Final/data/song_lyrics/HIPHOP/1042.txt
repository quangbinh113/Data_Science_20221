Song Name: Already Won (feat. Lil Durk)
Hm, hm, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, woah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah (Will A Fool) uh
My ex had told my my cousin I'm a superstar
'Cause all around the world they know who we are
Running behind that money got me missing my bed
Chasing after that paper, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Back to back doing shows, I caught a jet to that bag
Just in case it get rainy when I check the forecast
I put the money in the floor 'cause I'm too scared to go back
It took an hour and a half to count a million in cash
Tell me why she blowing up my cellular?
Gotta see if I can fit you in my schedule
She said listen when I told you I wasn't regular
'Cause now I'm gone, we cross the globе with all this flexing stuff
Hopping on and off jets and stuff
Phone ring on thе way to the show
Sister called me, said she heard me on the radio, uh
Auntie called me, say she saw me on the TV screen
She's proud of me and happy that I'm chasing dreams
Even at your best (yeah, yeah)
Never knew it'd come to this
You know often
I get so lost in my thoughts just thinking 'bout losses
And I remember where I come from, I already won (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Already won, already won
You already won, yeah, yeah, you already won
I'm not a regular-degular
She telling my business, you niggas be letting her
I just be telling her love me
Just give me some time, fit me in your schedule (schedule)
I wanna spoil you, I wanna wife you, I want you to keep being sexual
All of these bitches be on me in videos, I keep it professional (professional)
I'm on the road for a minute, some cities ain't got no service (ain't got no service)
You know you already won, deep talks, you ain't gotta be nervous (be nervous)
I text you late on the e-way, I found myself keep swervin'
I found myself off Perky, I found myself keep purgin'
(For sure, for sure) Do I love you?
(For sure, for sure) Am I for you?
(For sure, for sure) She want for sure (for sure)
I hold in shit that hurt me bad so you won't think I'm weak
I stay up late to think 'bout us, she think I'm sleep
Phone ring on the way to the show
Sister called me, said she heard me on the radio, uh
Auntie called me, say she saw me on the TV screen
She's proud of me and happy that I'm chasing dreams
Even at your best (yeah, yeah)
Never knew it'd come to this
You know often
I get so lost in my thoughts just thinking 'bout losses
And I remember where I come from, I already won
I can't really look at this shit halfway empty when it's halfway full
Already won, already won (I take everything that come with this life)
You already won, yeah, yeah, you already won (for sure, already won)
Already won
Already won, already won
Yeah
