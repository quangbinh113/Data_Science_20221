Song Name: Hats Off (feat. Travis Scott)
What's happenin', Chi Chi?
Change my name to the kid, that's a baby goat
Keep a Drac' like I started up OVO
You can get a percent, but I want the most
Got a house with a lake, so I bought a boat
'Bout to switch up a play, that's an audible
State-to-state, private jet with some model hoes
Had to run up more dollars than followers
Me and bae take the week off in Cabo
Life's a gamble, I'm playin' the lotto
I'm bettin' it all 'cause I know that I got 'em
'Member me? I was drivin' Impalas
We don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it
I remember that D2 revolver I bought for my partner
He died in a argument
They was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em
'Member askin' my mom where my father been at
Ain't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at
Niggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had
Get them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag
Say he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can
Hop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band
I come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand
20 hour flight, had popped me a Xan
I got horny, almost fucked on a fan
I had thinked about it, I can't end up on Shade Room
Everything that I hit, I done paid for
She know what I can bring to the table
I can tell if it's real by the label
We had TV, but we didn't have cable
Now I'm richer than all of my neighbors
I wear my chain proud, it's a trophy
I'm with the same crowd, these the brodies
I don't got the same mind, you don't know me
You don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key
I'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you
The Forgiatos 24, this for Kobe
I shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me
You ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
Bitch, I'm a D-boy, do it for T.Roy
I'm on you forever, that's just word to V.Roy
I'm with the killas forever, the trenches is in me
The Grammys can't change me for nothin'
I like the bitches who let me just offer them cash
You never gon' ask me for nothin'
Never gon' switch
Only time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button
Rappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'
That's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'
4TF, Only the Family
But Four Pockets Full, but we keep it a hundred
That shit solid, I done took losses
I done turned robbers to killers and bosses
I been that nigga from way, way back
Way before Uzi was droppin' the cross
We just a family, we never recruitin'
Clique full of killas, we choosin' to shoot 'em
Someone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script
And just tell 'em to free Larry Hoover
Me, I'm the voice, Baby, the hero
Trav like Michael Jackson, yeah
Been in it a minute, it's crazy I'm winnin'
It only feel like I've been rappin' a year
Let a nigga play with me, I'm ready
My bitch gettin' rich off cosmetics
Life off, they done freed my daddy
Lights off, I couldn't see my baby
2010, I had a gun in my Pelle
2011, I was fightin' my celly
2012, I signed my deal in Cali
2021, I'm big as Khaled, oh-woah
I wear my chain proud, it's a trophy
I'm with the same crowd, these the brodies
I don't got the same mind, you don't know me
You don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key
I'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you
The Forgiatos 24, this for Kobe
I shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me
You ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day

(Yeah)
After this drop, then it's only a label
You see the crosses surroundin' the table
But never crosses, we flip ya, alfredo
Bro, do a solid without a potato
I took the logic and built out a payroll
All the whips chocolate, I built it like Legos (let's go)
I leave him deceased (yeah)
Only way that they ever find peace (yeah)
In that case, then I might need a priest (yeah)
In the streets, gotta keep the belief
Not a wave, gotta keep you a sea (sea)
Look for me, gotta keep you a fee (fee)
Made a hundred and put it on gold (it's lit)
Took the steppas and put 'em on roll (straight up)
It's a lotta them ridin' and glidin' and slidin'
That's ready to snatch up your soul (yeah)
I was 18 still when I got my deal
Then Dre had to go up the road (up the road)
Now he back outside and see lil' bro, he got believers
R.I.P. Big Tone, I know you see us
Sorry, gotta fuck on the low, I can't make Cheaters
Dawg, we got it bussin' out the bleachers (yeah)
It's jumpin' like wall to wall
(Trav like Michael Jackson, yeah)
(The truth, see, see)
