Ch-ch-ch-Chopsquad
Lil' bro shot in the crowd

Then he came through with the TEC (grrra)
I think he wasted the n-, damn
I think he wasted the n-, no, I know he wasted the n- (hol' up, ayy)
I ain't gon' play with you n-, I ain't gon' play with you n-
I'm not gon' play with you n-, ain't finna play with you n-
You know the n- that's dyin', I know the n- that did it (I know the n- that killed)
I know the n- that's solid
You know the n- that's snitchin' (you know the n-, let's go)
I ain't gon' play with you n- (play with you, boy)
I'm not finna play with you n- (play with you, boy)
I ain't 'bout to play with you n- (play with me, boy)
I ain't gon' play with you n- (-play with me)

These n- I got with me with it (n- I got with me)
It ain't no point in you hidin' (grrra), I want you, I'ma come get you (go get it)
I ain't gon' play with you, n- you got with you p-
These n- I got with me with it
This s- like GTA, we be on missions
These n- be dancin', that stick got 'em twitchin'
N- don't ask me who is my opps, if you ain't the gang then stay out our bidness
Ain't gon' respond on the 'net but just know I saw it, I see you, you gettin' it
He talkin' too crazy, we ridin', we lookin'
N- ain't out here, can't find them, they p-
His gang don't claim him, they say he d- suckin'
You know that I'm quiet, them choppers talk for me
Von hit L.A., I brought him a pole
I gave it to Gleesh and we walked in the store
I was with Booka first time in the O, and I had the b- on me
Was ready to blow (baow)
I ain't gon' play with you n-, I ain't gon' play with you n-
I'm not gon' play with you n-, ain't finna play with you n-
You know the n- that's dyin', I know the n- that did it (I know the n- that killed)
I know the n- that's solid
You know the n- that's snitchin' (you know the n-, let's go)
I ain't gon' play with you n- (play with you boy)
I'm not finna play with you n- (nah, boy)

I want you, I'ma come get you (boom, boom, Von)
Boy, I ain't gon' play with these n-

Better watch what you say to a n- (huh? What?)
He'll take it to court and turn state on a n- (why did you say that?)
And I keep me a pistol, F-N, the initials (yeah)
I promise to God I won't miss (grrra, grrra)
And you know I'm official, my n- gorillas (what?)
I tell 'em to get you, they get you (boom)
Folks 'nem snakes, they low down (uh-huh)
If we catch a opp, it's gon' go down (it's gon' go down)
Pull up on they block with the .4's out (what?)
N- play crazy in this b-, knock his soul out (boom, boom)
Them n- with me they be steppin' for me (steppers)
They steppin' for love, they ain't steppin' for free (ain't steppin')
Put ten on his head, that lil' n- cheap (huh? What?)
I just got a call, he got found in the street (boom, boom)
I ain't gon' play with you n-, I ain't gon' play with you n- (Chopsquad)
I'm not gon' play with you n- (play), -play with you n- (play with these n-)
You know the n- that's dyin' (you know the n-)
I know the n- that did it (I know the n- that killed)
I know the n- that's solid (I know them n-)
You know the n- that's snitchin' (you know the n-, let's go)
I ain't gon' play with you n- (I ain't gon' play)
I'm not finna play with you n- (ain't gon' play with these boys)
I ain't 'bout to play with you n- (play with me)
I ain't gon' play with you n- (play with me)
Them n- you got with you p- (what?)
