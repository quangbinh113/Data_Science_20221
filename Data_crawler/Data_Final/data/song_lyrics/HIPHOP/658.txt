Song Name: Stuntin' On You (feat. DaBaby)
720 when I ride out
Blue hunnids got her comin' down the pole when I buy it out
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
Need that Rollie, want me to buy it, huh? (Buy)
Take you to Bal Harbour spend a couple thousand, huh? (Dollars)
You need a nigga to put the mileage on it (mileage)
She talkin', I'm proud of her, I put that Prada on her (Prada)
Big grain, grippin' lame niggas can't talk like this (lame nigga)
Beat the pussy, now she walk like this (walk like this)
They ain't never seen money in the vault like this (in the vault like this)
Cash money, bling, bling when I talk like this (like this)
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
I be stuntin' like my motherfuckin' dad, let me go
I'm talkin' Wayne 2006 on a private plane, hop out my bitch
Went and took like 45 thousand dollars
Put a brand new watch on top of my wrist (bling)
And I pulled up to the Grammys in a Rolls-Royce truck
With a brand new Glock on the side of my hip, nigga please
Don't turn me up, don't start with me (uh-uh)
Walk in the store, get e'rythin', shit like a robbery
He checked his girlfriend Instagram, I bet she follow me
I pulled up rockin' Prada boots, my lil' bitch say she proud of me
When they see Baby they like
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
Oh-oh

Oh-oh

Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big spender, yeah, hundred on my wrist, yeah
Oh-oh, stuntin' on you
Big tipper, yeah, hundred on my bitch, yeah
