Hold on, what's that? BD, rush that!
Opps tried to score but that shit was a touchback
Spin the block, turn that nigga into a dust pack
Heard he had the glizzy but ain't get to bust that
Oh, goddamn, that's tragic
We makin' shit disappear like magic (Poof)
Just hit a lick with a bad bitch
She threw the oop on one of these rappers
She said they in the hotel lacking
One thing about her, she don't do no cappin'
So I send Seal and Bron
They run in your shit and I don't know what happened
(Give me that shit, nigga)
Brrt, VLONE on me
Drip

Dick
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm lit (I'm lit)
I know some bitches that play with them pieces
They came in this bitch with they own bodies (They got it)
We throwing money in the air
This ain't even the strip club
But we all wildin' (We wildin')B
