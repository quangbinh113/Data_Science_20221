Members Only, Volume 2
Ayy, pick up the pace
Tell 'em why I ain't find no haze
Indeed I am greedy, my heart full of vain (Yeah, yeah)
The needle, my veins, I'm falling asleep (Okay)
King of the dead, I sever your head (Okay)
When shit touch the river, my reign will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead (Okay)
I watch my demons become Super Saiyan (Okay)
Oh, I'm not an orphan (Yeah)
Death is my importance (Yeah, okay)
Retch, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again
Oh, I'm not an orphan (Okay)
Death is my importance
Retch, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again (Yeah)
I found this sound in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore this sound, like the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music

It's nice, actually
I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't ever have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help
Found this sound in Sweden
The more I explore is the more I fall in love with the music I make
