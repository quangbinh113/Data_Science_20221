Song Name: MoshPit (feat. Juice WRLD)
I'm stompin'
Let's start a moshpit
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
Yeah
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating cod fish in here (Eating cod fish in here)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Skrrt)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)
Out of space, hot like a martian in here
Doing donuts in the lot, ain't no parking in here (Yeah)
We about that action, ain't no talking in here
Shorty twerking on the walls, Peter Parker in here (Ayy)
Haters in the rear view
Ex on my phone, we too loud, I can't hear you
His blood turn his coat red, I will Paul Revere you
I'ma ball 'til I fall, I will Cavalier you
Space Jam jumping, they asking who let the monsters in here
I'm with killers I'm with straight Jeffrey Dahmers in here
I hang with animals, lil' brodie brought the llama in here
Money old, old enough to fuck your mama in here, oh yeah
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating cod fish in here
(Eating cod fish in here)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Skrrt)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)
Fuck a protest, let's start a fight in here
I just stepped up in the party, all my snipers here
I be rocking Tom Ford, popping Molly, though
Now I'm eating calamari, no more sloppy joe
Choke sandwich in my mansion, tryna save for dinner
I'ma start a moshpit in the Staples Center
All you niggas bitter, it's alright, though
Codeine in my liver, I'm sippin' hydro
I'm blowing nitro, smoking jetpack
Hating on a street nigga, can't respect that
I wanna jump out in a crowd, but I be scared to do it
'Cause if they pull on me the wrong way, I'ma go to shooting
Yeah, red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating codfish in here
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stomping in here
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eating cod fish in here (Ayy)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
