Song Name: Stay Inside
Fuckin' war goin' on outside right now, tsh
Rest in peace to all the fallen soldiers, man
Fuck the opps
Know we're slidin'
Free the guys
If you ain't steppin', you ain't ready for the war, stay inside
If you ain't chippin' in for firearms or corn, stay inside
If you ain't puttin' money for dingers or been pullin' them triggers
We can still be niggas, but stay inside
If you ain't steppin', you ain't ready for the war, stay inside
If you ain't chippin' in for firearms or corn, stay inside
If you ain't puttin' money for dingers or been pullin' them triggers
We can still be niggas, but stay inside
I don't think you really know what's happenin' in West
He was out without a vest and got a bullet in his chest (Bang)
We're gettin' older, so we shoot and we don't cheff (Grrah)
If you don't hear (Grrah),
You must feel us (Grrah)
So his outcome (Grrah) was death (Dead)
All these unsolved murders, it's a mystery (Grrah, grrah)
They ain't seen this much shootings in history (Grrah, grrah)
There ain't a caution sign to tell them that it's slippery
Slip, your gonna dead and you can't claim from that injury
(Your gonna dead)
What's your bro flaggin'?
We'll grab him and toe-tag him (Grrah, grrah)
We've been soul snatchin'
Pole packin' and throat slashin' (Grrah, grrah)
We've been chrome slappin', head splattered, no chattin' (Bang)
If you ain't shootin' shit, shut the fuck up and stop rappin'
If you ain't steppin', you ain't ready for the war, stay inside
If you ain't chippin' in for firearms or corn, stay inside
If you ain't puttin' money for dingers or been pullin' them triggers
We can still be niggas, but stay inside
If you ain't steppin', you ain't ready for the war, stay inside
If you ain't chippin' in for firearms or corn, stay inside
If you ain't puttin' money for dingers or been pullin' them triggers
We can still be niggas, but stay inside
