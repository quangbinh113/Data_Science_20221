You can't look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes that tell that I cried then
Rockstars are not trying to hide them
Remember those who win, not the one tired
Why can't you look into my eyes
And tell me what is it that you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes and tell me what is it you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
I've been thugging for so long trying to bypass
I'll be doing in my room and see my life flash
Through the pain and perseverance, I ain't even shed tears
Overcome very obstacle, I ain't got no fear
Don't you know it wasn't easy, eh
What you thinking when you see me, yeah
Even when the sun goes down
I'm up trying to keep my fantasy
I'll be holding it down, every real nigga gonna gravitate
Everyday ten toe down, I swear nothing gon' go down this way
My nigga, I'm not your man
You don't know me, I ain't from around this way
Go hard coming down when I sleep
Go hard, so I can sleep when I die
Try to find a peace of my mind
You can't look in my eyes and tell'em I; m tired of trying
Look me in the eyes that tell that I cried then
Dating rock stars 'cause I'm not trying to hide them
Remember those who win, not the one tired
Why can't you look into my eyes
And tell me what is it that you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes and tell me what is it you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Eh, ever since I came up, yeah, I've been
Living like tomorrow ain't gon' come
Switching girls like my heart can't go know 'em
Put into the flow like I'm on the run
All this shine all the rain gotta go
Got to get mine back to the slums
Back to the crumbs
I don't feel the pain, I need a little up
And I bought my herbs, sip my drink
Til my words get slurred and work that bih
'Til she work my nerves
Then move on to the next city like word
What I do is none of your concern
Take my shot, you can wait your turn
Every single thing I got I earned
Every single loss lesson learned, yeah (Chill)
You're the reason why my back is turned
Only took my time for to learn
I won't say it, things you don't deserve
I won't do a things you don't deserve (yeah)
I ask you why only twenty-four
Because survival is my only choice
I'm living my life like I know it's short
Oh, it's a miracle to find remorse
You can't look in my eyes and tell'em tired of trying
Look me in the eyes that tell that I cried then
Dating rock stars 'cause I'm not trying to hide them
Remember those who win, not the one tired
Why can't you look into my eyes
And tell me what is it that you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes and tell me what is it you see
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
