Song Name: B R Right (feat. Ludacris)
I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Wait bitch, I'ma blow my kisses
Get pissed then throw my dishes
Y'all niggas know just who this is
(Woo woo!) And the head so vicious
With me, this shit gon' cost
You short, then that's your loss
You know this ass is soft
Make a nigga go to breaking off
Tell me that you love me baby
Get high and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws
My girls be shoppin' hard
These hoes be buyin' cars
In the club buyin' bars
Nipples hard in designer bras
From my niggas who gettin cheese
Throw back in the crispy g's
Moet, Cris on freeze
Laugh at the tab 'cause this on me
Me and Luda in a Cut Supreme
Doin' things jus to touch the cream
So many names wanna fuck the queen
I live a life like it's just a dream
I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
(Get it right brother, jump)
Give me the beat then I'ma make it bump
Tell me what you wanna hear, damn, yes you can
Trouble with your man I'ma pop my trunk
You ain't seen no chicks like mine
You ain't seen no flicks like mine
Gonna make you (Ugh!) next to the subwoofers in my six by nine's
Tell me that you like it raw
Tell me that my dick is wah!
I might make you famous and buy you watches by Maurice Lacroix
Tell me if it's new or old
Tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold
Say Ludacris six million sold
See I ain't got no time for games
And I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my southern slang
Ooh, eee, walla walla bing bang
So anytime you need me call
Winter, summer, spring, or fall
It doesn't matter come one come all
Either get dropped or drop them drawers
I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Diamond, princess
Just mind your business
These rumors are senseless
Your whispers are endless
We livin' Ghetto fab
We spendin hella cash
This girl is hella bad
Your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores
You saw me grace the Source
You watched me work the Vibe
Bitches I works for mine
One time, for these divas
Two times, for these Visas
Third time I come I'm breezin'
The ice just keeps on freezin'
Hold up I'ma keep it goin'
Back to back, I'ma keep on blowin'
Platinum plaques, keepin' it hood
Wet sex, keepin' it good
Look girl, you dont know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas'll slow your roll
Pussy power, we in control
I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)
(Yup everything gon be alright)
Yeah, that's right
I'm back again
Round two motherfuckers
That's right
I'm talking greasy
I'm a arrogant lil' motherfucker huh?
That's right I'm rich, I'm that bitch
That's right
I'm about show y'all how to pimp this shit
I'm fuckin' niggas in the face
The game is mine, 2003
Fuck that, fuck all y'all haters, fuck all y'all bitches, get a life!
You got too much times on your hands
I want y'all bitches to get a job
Up your game, pimp your game up baby
It's all about me this time, fuck that
Fuck a dime, I'm a silver dolla, holla
Catch me when I come off tour, fuck y'all
I'm out
