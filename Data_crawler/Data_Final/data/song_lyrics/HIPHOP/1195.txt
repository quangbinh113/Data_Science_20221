Song Name: My Life In A Nutshell
My life in a nutshell
This my life in a nutshell
This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven's so far away, I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels (pain feels)
These prescriptions that I fill
Never make the pain heal
Fuck, uh
Back in the lost and found, I go
But I'm more lost than found, I know
I feel so cold in L.A. like I'm sittin' back at home, Chicago
They say living's harder than dyin'
I'm willin' to gamble that
Find me unresponsive in a hotel room
Girl, can you handle that?
Worst case scenario
You still hear my songs on the stereo
You still hear my name on the radio
So I'll live forever, forever
This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven's so far away, I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels (pain feels)
These prescriptions that I fill
Never make the pain heal
Ho-oh-oh, oh
Death melodies I sing
Cardiac arrest notes
I hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
But that's the ugly truth
So much of my life and time the world's consumed
I throw the deuce and grab the noose
Onto the next chapter
None of this matters
I've been feelin' helpless
This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven's so far away I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels (pain feels)
These prescriptions that I fill
Never make the pain heal
