Song Name: Fraud
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
(Hitmaka)
(We are forever)
I ain't never fall in love with a beggin' ass broad
I'm a trapper not a scammer, ain't shit by me fraud, you heard?
Wait, what? And I put that on God
Pull up, too, too-too, too-too
Shit'll shoot up your yard (what they talking 'bout?)
I ain't never fall in love with a beggin' ass broad
I'm a trapper not a scammer, ain't shit by me fraud, you heard?
Wait, what? And I put that on God
Pull up, too, too-too, too-too
Shit'll shoot up your yard, yeah
Thug nigga, she just wanna fuck for a Patek (woo)
Ridin' through the city with your bitch causin' havoc
Dope boy shit, send a brick to an addict
Give her dope dick, she says she love when I'm nasty
I just wanna fuck her with my chains, I'm flashing (rich)
Told her, "Tag my name, if you mean it, don't hide me"
Blowin' on that carpet, I was Aladdin, she Jasmine
And that bitch I fucked don't know my name, she call me daddy
First nigga in my hood with them pies just like Patty
Young and flashy, I'm in the traffic, almost crashed it (skrrt)
Almost all my bitch exotic, she gon' fuck me for my fashion (go)
Bring your friend around, she wanna tag team
Swear she livin' single like she Maxine
I know she got a nigga, still don't act clean
Keep one eye on her 'cause she's a trap queen
And bitch, I'm packin' (haan)
I ain't never fall in love with a beggin' ass broad
I'm a trapper not a scammer, ain't shit by me fraud, you heard?
Wait, what? And I put that on God
Pull up, too, too-too, too-too
Shit'lI shoot up your yard, yeah
Thug nigga, she just wanna fuck for a Patek (woo)
Ridin' through the city with your bitch causin' havoc
Dope boy shit, send a brick to an addict
Give her dope dick, she says she love when I'm nasty
Blue hunnids like Avatar (yeah)
None of my bitches average
CokeBoy, you's a ho, boy, I been had it (haan)
Chanel number five, she like Coco in Paris
Ridin' round with this stick, feel just like a caddie (bah-bah, bah-bah)
Swervin' in that Ghost, move like Ghost, got the Power (skrrt)
Trapper turned to rapper, made a million in an hour (haan)
Took your bitch to Turks and Caicos just so she could tan (tan)
Boyfriend swear he kickin', boy, he's just Lieutenant Dan (Lieutenant Dan)
Got his wifey and she told me he's a fan (he's a fan)
Spend so much on Saint Laurent, they tried to ban (woo)
Bitch please, diamonds hittin', Jackie Chan (Chan)
Fuck you mean? I'm just sayin'
I ain't never fall in love with a beggin' ass broad
I'm a trapper not a scammer, ain't shit by me fraud, you heard?
Wait, what? And I put that on God
Pull up, too, too-too, too-too
Shit'll shoot up your yard, yeah
Thug nigga, she just wanna fuck for a Patek (woo)
Ridin' through the city with your bitch causin' havoc
Dope boys shit, send a brick to an addict
Give her dope dick, she says she love when I'm nasty
I ain't never fall in love with a beggin' ass broad
I'm a trapper not a scammer, ain't shit by me fraud, you heard?
Wait, what? And I put that on God
Pull up, too, too-too, too-too
