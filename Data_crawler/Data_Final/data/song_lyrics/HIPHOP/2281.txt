Song Name: Ballin
I'm ballin yeah
Ballin' like LeBron son
Heartless with a star knife
Oh baby, just install this, on me (On me)
Got features like RiRi
And this water on my wrist
Like Figi, I'm ballin' (Ballin')
Drop thirty on my fit (Ballin')
Don't worry, I won't miss
Got my hoodie on like Melo in the garden
Got my money up
I'm ballin' like LeBron son (Yeah)
They want me to lose my breath
So, I got to watch my step (Hm)
Two thirtys on my hip (Hm)
I call 'em Steph and Seth (Mm-hm)
Richy-rich my wrist (Mm-hm)
Call Teki to whip my drip (Mm-hm)
Chrome heart on my chest, I'm ballin' (Yeah, woo)
I feel like the last one left (Mm-hm)
I put the, "X" in, "Flex" (Mm-hm)
I'm shootin' with my left like Harden (Like Harden)
So much water on my wrist, it make my arm numb (Arm numb)
All this money, bitch, I'm ballin' like LeBron son yeah
And you can tell by the way I dress Louis V' my garments (V' my garments)
So much fly shit, I can take you shoppin' in my closet (Closet, yeah)
And, nowadays, most of these artists sound like Artist (Sound like me)
Trust me, they can't ball the way
I'm ballin LeBron son
Heartless, with a star knife
Oh baby, just install this on me (On me)
Got features like RiRi
And this water on my wrist (My wrist, yeah)
Like Figi, I'm ballin' (Ballin')
Drop thirty on my fit (Ballin')
Don't worry, I won't miss you
Ballin', ballin' (Yeah)
Ballin'
Nigga known to leave for me, the opps wanna leave me
I don't get left, I do the leavin
A .30 on me 'cause I know that they talkin' on me behind my back
But, it ain't shit when they see me
R.I.P Beatsy
Nowadays, I don't even be sleep
Drink champagne everyday like a week
And a lot of models, I be takin' it easy
Model after model, I know you see me
Go bottle after bottle, like the genie
Shakin' at the bottle like it's graffiti
I'm never cappin', I pulled up with a beanie
True style, livin' life like The Beatles
Balmain, she don't like True Religions
Don't judge me, I'm not too religious
Rockin' Mikes, used to be the Thebanenes
They don't even know about Thebanenes
Rest in peace, my nigga, Quado, and Beasty
Twenty-four and I'm doubled up, luxury
He aint paid in full, don't call me luggy
Try showin' love, they didn't fuck with me
Now, I'm goin' up, ain't with the fuckery
Doin' irregular shit, on a regular
Bitches only wanna fuck for my revenue
Ballin' like LeBron son
Heartless with a star knife
Oh, baby, just install this on me (On me)
Got features like RiRi
And this water on my wrist (My wrist, yeah)
Like Figi, I'm ballin' (Ballin')
Drop thirty on my fit (Ballin')
Don't worry, I won't miss yeah
Ballin', ballin' (Yeah)
Ballin'
