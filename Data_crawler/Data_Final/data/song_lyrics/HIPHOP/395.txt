Song Name: Twisted (feat. Logic & A$AP Rocky)
Hah
Mafia
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice (Hah)
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice (Hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Come get twisted with the Juice, I'm your nigga
Fuck with Montana, bitch, that's my nigga
1 AM, she was callin' me her papi (Hah)
2 AM, we meet up at the lobby (Hah)
3 AM, yeah, I was gettin' sloppy (Hah)
At 4 AM, I passed her to Rocky (Hah)
This the same bitch, on that same shit (Hah)
Ain't got no talent, she's just known for suckin' famous dicks (Hah)
Niggas ballin' out, buyin' all kinda gifts
Shawty's pussy must be dope, 'cause niggas can't quit
For that fame they bussin, nothin' strange to us (Hah)
Bitches tweakin' like they on angel dust
When I park that Lec', and I slide through the back
Bitches hoppin' off the pole like "Where the paper at?
Fuck with Montana, 'cause I'm your nigga
Black Rollie Barack, Ciroc in my liver
Who the fuck is this? Pull up in a Gati with a three quarter mink
Shawty ridin' shotty with a rock like a brick hit
Yeah, that's that drip
I got brown bags, loads, tic-tac-toe, X's, O's
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (Hah)
300 on a coupe, 300 for the show (Hah)
Doors open up, legs open wide
Grind 'til the night over, I ain't come up overnight (Hah)
Twisted off the juice, top of the roof
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (How you like)
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Come get twisted with the Juice, I'm your nigga
Fuck with Montana, bitch, that's my nigga
She said she ain't never done no shit like this before
I said, I know you ain't a ho, but girl just let it go
I'm finna' floor, I'm finna' catch a flow, like "Woah"
Get your ass up on the pole, let your worries go
She said, "I know I ain't a ho, I'm just tryna get this money, you know how it go" forsho'
Bust a nut and then I roll
Bitches call me Bobby Tarantino
We know I'ma get the C-note, then I relocate
Fuck her then I bounce, hell nah, I can't do no date
1-800, then I kill the pussy, who can relate?
Got a bitch in all states, like the fake Denzel
Word to Yeezy, my shit's breezy, it's too easy
This money please me, these fake rappers don't apease me
If you ain't talkin' money, you need to talk to French
That's word to Karim, we live in the dream, know what I mean?
Whip clean, peanut butter on the inside
Bitches be beautiful, but they ugly on the inside, woo
Shut your fuckin' mouth, 'cause Bobby Boy he comin' through
Word to Triple-6, suck on up my dick
Slob on my knob, girl you're beautiful, that's word to God
Goddamn, I'm the man, do it 'cause I can
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Dance, dance like you dancin' on a pole (On a pole, hah)
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Twisted off the juice, twisted, twisted off the juice
Don't get twisted with the juice, I'm your nigga
Fuck with Montana, bitch, that's my nigga
Coke Boy baby
