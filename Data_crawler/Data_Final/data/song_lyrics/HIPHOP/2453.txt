Song Name: Closer (feat. H.E.R.)
Hold me closer
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
When I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me
I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
It's the freak in me, I want-
I wanna fall in love for the weekend
Three boyfriends, I don't know where I'm sleeping (uh-huh)
We be clubbing, thugging, fucking
Order room service when we done, that's the sequence
He know I'm a classy nympho
Keep it simple, you know what you here for
Tell the concierge let you up with the key code
All his ice on, but he 'bout to catch a heat stroke
You got everything that I like
You don't eat the booty? You lying
Caught you mixing liquors, you might hold me tight and pull me
Closer
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
When I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me
I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
It's the freak in me, I want-
Want a quickie in my rose on my Herm√®s leather
No shoes in my car, 'cause my floor mats feather
Ain't tripping if it rain 'cause it came with umbrellas, it get wetter
I got 'em sending Birkins on my birthday (uh-huh)
I ain't never met him, he don't even know my birth name
Liking all my pics, so I know he like 'em curvy
Crush on a "it-boy", want him in the worst way
I just roll the dice, only store him under nicknames
Icy, mwah, ooh, la-la (icy)
Take them eight inch out them drawers
Da Vinci dick, come paint these walls
Hold me closer, ooh, ce soir
Hold me closer (closer)
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya (let me show ya, babe)
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
When I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me
I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do (everything you do)
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do (yeah, I do, baby)
It's the freak in me, I want-
