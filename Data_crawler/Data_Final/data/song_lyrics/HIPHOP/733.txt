Song Name: Personal Favorite (feat. Rich The Kid)
Chasin the money all day
(Tell me where to go, tell me where to go, ayy)
(Tell me where to go, tell me where to go)
(Tell me where to go)
Yeah
Tell me where to go (go), tell me where to go (yeah)
I know you mad, but let it go (go), gotta let it go (ayy)
Gotta keep control (okay), pour my heart out, ayy (ayy)
Pour me up a four (four), it's time to set the tone
Look me in my eyes, bitch, look me in my soul
When you said you loved me, I took it personal
Nobody else worthy, your ass deserve the throne
Ayy, you deserve it, girl
I don't do the runaround, better not to go there
Saint Laurent, Moncler, sippin' on some Belaire
Palm trees, fresh air, put my hands through her hair
Where you wanna go? I'll take you there, yeah
Uh, she wanna have sex, let's get on a jet (wanna have sex)
I'm grippin' her neck while I'm rubbin' her breasts (woo, yeah)
Uh, I ball like the Nets, so hard to impress (impress)
You talkin' that shit, but you cannot flex (flex)
Niggas be cap like Mitchell and Ness (yeah)
Tell me where to go (go), tell me where to go (yeah)
I know you mad, but let it go (go), gotta let it go (ayy)
Gotta keep control (okay), pour my heart out, ayy (ayy)
Pour me up a four (four), it's time to set the tone
Look me in my eyes, bitch, look me in my soul
When you said you loved me, I took it personal
Nobody else worthy, your ass deserve the throne
Ayy, you deserve it, girl
You got the throne, you set the tone
And every time she call my phone, you know I'm gone
(You know I'm gone)
Hit it from the back, I tell her, "Look back at me, baby" (baby)
When she ride the dick, you know she talkin' to me crazy
She get Chanel, yeah (Chanel, yeah)
My bitch too goddamn cold, she need a Moncler (Moncler)
Ain't running games with your love, I gotta play fair (play fair)
When I hit that spot, she be like, "Oh yeah" (oh yeah)
Said she got the pussy for me
Tell me where to go (tell me where to go)
I ain't buy one Birkin
Went ahead and bought her four (I bought her four)
Know you mad, let it go (go)
Broke your heart, I can't do it no more (more)
New Chanel from her head to her toe (Chanel)
Need your love, tell me, where do I go (what?)
Tell me where to go (go), tell me where to go (yeah)
I know you mad, but let it go (go), gotta let it go (ayy)
Gotta keep control (okay), pour my heart out, ayy (ayy)
Pour me up a four (four), it's time to set the tone
Look me in my eyes, bitch, look me in my soul
When you said you loved me, I took it personal
Nobody else worthy, your ass deserve the throne
Ayy, you deserve it, girl
