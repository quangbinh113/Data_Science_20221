This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
If they don't pay your bills
Pay them no mind
Move on to the friend
If he wasting time
He calling again
Then bitch hit decline
'Cause when they forget
Then you must remind
Such a big deal
Ahead of its time
I keep it on chill
A hint of that lime
I'm in the field
Most of the time
Lordette of the ghetto
They must have a shrine
Hallelujah what it do, yeah
If you want it gotta bust a move, yeah
If they offer one, tell 'em two, yeah
Baby make 'em play by your rules, yeah
I'm cunt
Straight like that with a lil bit of a stunt
Cartier frames help me see what I want
Red dirt and concrete mixed in a blunt
If you got a problem, we can take it out front
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now (uh)
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
R.I.P. to brax (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
VA loves you baby girl (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
Hampton to Halifax (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
We gon' take this round the world (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm, I'm a big girl now)
A good thing all up in his face
But I ain't got no time to waste
The only thing that keep me safe, is my safe
The bank is the only thing I'll ever chase
A love I never can replace
Speaking of
I'm a need you to pay me like you paying him
I put that word on my timbs
I just bent one of my rims
So you know I need them ends
Plus these babies need pampers
Mo' hundreds for the dancers
And if she give you a shot
Then you better romance her
Straight shooter, I'm the answer
Ho pull up
Diamonds all up in my grill and my juste un clou
Complimenting my bubble goose
I came up on that sunny dale and that jungle juice
You do not want me running loose, no
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now (pop it)
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
R.I.P. to brax (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
VA loves you baby girl (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
Hampton to Halifax (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm)
We gon' take this round the world (this my pussy, I can do what I want, hm, I'm a big girl now)
24 karats all up in my hydro
Mention my name, all the real girls know
I'm like an exclusive sneaker
Coming through the speaker
They line up to come see the show
A natural-born killa
But I'm a need spike to direct my thriller
Girl forty-seven aka Carry Anne
VA to BK, baby we back again
Love to the baby mamas in Tallahassee
On they paper route and they keep it classy
My Detroit girls that keep it playa
Love to the granny's, aunties, southern mayors
Gettin' shit done
Shake it, bake it, rake it
But girl don't break it
Stack it all up
And let nobody take it
Call 'em on the bullshit, nobody fake it
Say what you gotta say
Fuck how they 'gon take it
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now (pop it)
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want, hm
I'm a big girl now (now, now, now...)
