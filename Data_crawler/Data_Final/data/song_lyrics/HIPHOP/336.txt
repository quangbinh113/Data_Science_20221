Song Name: I Try
I try, I try
I try, I try
(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try
All in my head, I'm thinking
Dealing with these thoughts, tryna focus on breathing
How you gon' give up? You're not even try, try

Shawty wanna go with me
Say she wanna travel 'round the globe with me
It's cool, come rule the underworld with me
I can't imagine no other girl with me
Come get these diamonds and these pearls with me
I said come rule the fuckin' world with me, with me, with me
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
Bitch, I'm a dog, you cannot save me, don't ever play me
I got two Glocks with two forties, they shoot 'bout eighty
Bitch, I'm West, seven piece combo, that's on the gang, B
Don't give a fuck, these niggas mad 'bout petty change, B
And I can't let change change me, this shit so brazy
Growing up where I live, I see strange things
Growin' up without shit to having diamond rings, oh
Oh my God
I try, I try
I try, I try, try
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah
I try, yeah, try
Huh, yeah, try
Huh, yeah, try
Yeah, 'til I die
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
