Song Name: Excitement
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Sex ain't the only thing that's on my mind
But you get me so excited
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Irreplaceable, tattoos from your neck that drop down to your ankle
Drop top in the Range, shorty you wanna feel good
I wanna feel good too
Don't I make you feel good?
You get me so excited
Shorty wanna roll with a rockstar
Baby let's go, we can go far
Yeah, watch the stars
And go far
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
Shorty (Shorty)
Love me forever (Love me forever)
Shorty (Shorty)
Gotta love me forever (Gotta love me forever)
Shorty
Love me forever
(Shorty)
Yeah
Shorty wanna roll with a rockstar
Baby let's go, we can go far
Yeah, watch the stars
And go far
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
Sex ain't the only thing that's on my mind
But you get me so excited
Woah-oh-oh
Irreplaceable, tattoos from your neck that drop down to your ankle
Drop top in the Range, shorty you wanna feel good
I wanna feel good too
Don't I make you feel good?
You get me so excited, babe
How else should I feel about you, but crazy
Push the limits of my anxiety
When I'm inside it (Mm-mm)
My inside it
For you
For you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah uh
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
Shorty your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Poseidon
In control of your water, you loving my trident
