Song Name: Took Her To The O
Bang
Von, Von
Huh, what?
Von, Von
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
We in the car, she don't live that far
Say she left her purse, and I ain't trippin'
You know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust the U, pulled up to her spot
She live by the park, it's gettin' dark
My Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit
This bitch thick as shit, she got two minutes
If she ain't back out, she gon' need a Lyft (she gon' need a Lyft)
She left her phone, so I picked it up
This ho slow as fuck (she slow as fuck)
Nine missed calls, three of them from Mom, other six say, "Duck"
Now I look up, and I see a truck
It's just pullin' up, someone hopped out
A big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, "What? What he tryna do?"
So I clutched my move, but he kept walkin'
He don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
Now she walk out, she stop in her tracks
She get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga
He pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho
You know how it go
Don't got no K, I still got her phone
She takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car
So I hit the locks, tossed her her phone
Told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come Goofy, he hollerin' and shit
Yellin' bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, "Shit," I hopped out so quick
Then I raised my Blick, and I don't miss
I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now Von think quick, what you finna do?
'Cause this gone make the news, gotta make your moves
Told that bitch, "Get in," 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness
Plus I just popped through
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin'
And this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors
Made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry
I knock back, no doubt
I know you mad 'cause I smoked your mans, left him on the curb
She started laughin', she said "Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd"
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch
She from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock, with a ruler clip
Boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store
You know how it goes
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope
And took her to the O
I took her to the O
Uh, what?
Took her to the O
Uh, what?
You know how it go
Uh, what?
This shit ain't for show
Run up, then I blow, yeah
Took her to the O
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
You know how it go
