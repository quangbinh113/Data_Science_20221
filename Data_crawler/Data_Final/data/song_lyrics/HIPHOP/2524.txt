Song Name: THIQUE
Ass gettin' bigger
Racks gettin' bigger
Cash gettin' larger
He thought he was loving me good, I told him, "Go harder"
She thought she was killin' that shit, I told her, "Go harder"
Just look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water
Ass getting thiquer
Cash getting thiquer
That's that thique, that's that real shit
That's that jelly, baby, champagne and cherry, baby
That's that thique, that's that ball drop
That's that keep going, that's that never stop
That's that thique, that's that na-na, that oochy coochy, la, la
Yeah, this that Fiji agua, candy girl piñata
Hit it in the car and take you back to the casa
Bet I got you rock now, that thique all over the yacht, now
That's that freaknik, that's that 1996
That's that moon Miami bass, 12 in the trunk 808
Uh, that's that Castro, eat that shit like Mastro's
She say she on a diet, girl, you better not lose that ass, though
That's that thique, that's that real shit
That's that jelly, nigga
That's that really, nigga
That's that thique, that's that ball drop
That's that keep going, that's that never stop
Baby, that's that thique
That's that thique
Baby, that's that thique
That's that thique
Look at this shit
Ooh, that's that strawberry, that's that grape and cherry
This that Ginsu, cut that bitch like culinary
Ooh, that's that bounce, spend my money, make it count
If it's lost then make it found
Just keep dropping that shit down
That's that summer
That's them hummers
That's that girl, give me your number
That's that Jordy
That's that Scarlett
That I just got out of college
That's that I don't do this usually
I don't know what you do to me
That I don't do this usually
I don't know what you do to me
Boy you crazy, body mean
Back it up like limousine
They got to make a fold out to fit a magazine right
Girl, look at your body, right
Boy, take this in slow, don't let go
And tell me how bad you've been wanting it
And hurry up quick, 'fore the moment ends
I like what I hear, might be sleeping in
Screaming, "Beyoncé, chocolate ounces, sit on that, bounce it, bounce it"
Ass getting thiquer
Cash getting thiquer
Cash getting larger
He thought he was loving me good, I told him "Go harder"
(Baby that's that thique) thought she was killing that shit, I told her "Go harder"
(That's that thique) look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water
(Baby, that's that thique) racks getting thicker
(That's that thique) cash gettin'
Look at that shit
Ooh, baby, come feel me
Ooh, baby (I'm all up in your mind), it's all yours
Come here, come here, let's make love
Make love to your mind (I'm all up in your mind)
Make love to your mind
I'm all up in your mind (I'll breathe you in, I'll think your thoughts)
'Cause I'll read your mind, I'll read your mind
