Song Name: Papiâ€™s Home
I know that I hurt you (yeah)
I was a child trying to be a man (to all my sons worldwide)
I walked out on my only son (all my juniors)
I left you in your mother's hands (I apologize for my absence)
(I know I left you without a name to drop)
And now I'm standing right here (I don't know how I expected you to get)
(Your clout up, and get your money up, but)
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes (don't worry)
See your mother raised a fine young man (daddy's home)
And I know I missed so much of your life (turn me up) (Mario)
Yeah, niggas know they need to stop
I'm standing at the top, that's how I know you never seen the top
Sierra Canyon parking lot, lookin' like Magic City parking lot
Hear the talks when I walk by like you know it's over when we drop, ayy
Drop, yeah
And I'm coming with the wop, y'all niggas not poppin'
Fuck her then she goin' shoppin', woah, I'm runnin' out of opps
They're runnin' out of options, put them up for adoption
Sign my name on the dot (damn)
This is not luck, baby, this no four leaf, no horseshoe
I'm in the bank thinkin' "Poor you"
I'm in New York goin' Jon Chetrit
Supermodels and they all sexy
Lock the door to the bathroom 'cause they doin' something that is not Pepsi
I'm just pourin' up the shots
I remember that I told you I miss you, that was kinda like a mass text
I remember that I told I loved you, that was really in the past tense
I remember that I told you I get your true fears, that I get around
Mention havin' us a kid, '42 hit, I tend to kid around
Yeah, on Benedict with the top down
Shawties out here gettin' knocked down
City coming off a lockdown
Rap niggas doing weak features for a pop artist 'cause they popped down
Used to wanna throw the Roc up, niggas know how I rock now
You know how I'm rocking now
YM forever, big owl, big birds forever
Don't make me go get your momma to talk to you
'Cause if he gotta get your motherfuckin' momma to talk to you
You know what I'm sayin', I'ma bring that motherfuckin' big switch out
At this point, I'ma start collectin' child support the opposite way
You gotta pay me to keep my motherfuckin' son, ha-ha-ha-ha
Look at me
Take a real good look at me (wait)
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
Look me in the eyes, junior
I'm making no more promises
For real
I'm trying to find the word to say
Daddy's home
Daddy's home (don't you know)
Daddy's home (said, your daddy's back home), yeah
Daddy's home (for every birthday that I missed)
Wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends (start right here, right now)
If you wanna be my dad again (said, my only son)
We've got to start all over, be friends (can you look at me?)
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, that's it
Showtime
Something's happened to me, bro
Ha-ha-ha
