Song Name: USE THIS GOSPEL (feat. Kanye West & Eminem) - REMIX
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the Kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith
I'm holdin' on but I don't know if I can take it much longer
Today's the day that I put all of my trust and faith in You, Father
Please, let this hate make me stronger
'Fore they turn on me like a zombie
It's like I'm being strangled, unconscious (yeah)
When temptation is almost like Satan is baitin' you tryna take you away from your daughters
Danglin' a bunch of painkillers on ya
Wavin' them in your face and then watch them comin' extra strength
And that's why they make them in rectangular objects
'Cause that's the shape of a coffin
Though, it ain't medication this time
But, the devil's eggin' me on
And, I ain't gonna let them break me 'cause I'm a soldier
You can bank on that promise, like the Chamber of Commerce
So, my savior, I call on
To rescue me from these depths of despair
So, these demons better step like a stair
Because He is my shepherd
I'm armed with Jesus, my weapon is prayer
Soon, I squeeze it, I'm blessed like sneezes
Call me Yeezus, I'm effed in the head, maybe I'm bonkers
Regardless, never claimed to be flawless
Long as the mistakes I've acknowledged
Y'all wish I would say somethin' positive
Well, okay, then, I'm positive
They'd rather trade weather with Mayweather
'Cause they would fare way better with them odds
Than they would exchangin' some bars
Or tradin' any bars with Shady
And, it probably is painfully obvious
To compare Godliness to an atheist
But, I got them audiences ravin' (woo)
In amidst my squabbles
I got some awesome inspiration to drop them, off them
Pen and paper, I'm knockin' them off
Woke up on stage at concert
Whole place lookin' like a mosh pit
Bible at my side like a rifle with a God-given gift
Every single day I thank God for
That's why I pay so much homage
Praises to Jesus, I'll always
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the Kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Blessings from the altar got me feeling like I'm walking on water
