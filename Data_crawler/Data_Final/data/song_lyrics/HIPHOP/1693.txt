Song Name: Real Bitch (feat. Gloss Up)
Real bitches back in
I came here to win, you hoes came here to pretend
I'ma show you rap hoes how to get y'all shit off
Yeah
First thing first (huh?)
I ain't gotta fuck a rap nigga for a verse (not at all)
And I ain't never let a nigga treat me for a purse
So, all you unemployed hoes, come and get this work (work)
You bitches sleezy, this shit way too easy
City lil' me, I'm puttin' on like Jeezy (I'm puttin' on)
I ain't asthmatic, but this spit game Wheezy (ha-ha)
Put these rap hoes on the plate just to feed me
I'm getting greedy, I'm big key (yeah)
I'm not sweet, I check hoеs (check hoes)
Steady shittin' on thеse bitches with a pet though (with a pet though)
Yo' nigga want a taste, I give him wet nose
Takin' bitches' niggas, hoe, you lucky if you make it home
Real bitch (real bitch), don't fall
Fuck a nigga, get paid, that's cold (that's cold)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
I'm a real bitch (real bitch), don't fall
Fuck a nigga get paid, that's code (that's code)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
I'm a real bitch, with a real bag
And word to Miami, bitch, I'm real bad
New nigga, new money, that's a real grab
I ain't stunting, no nigga that I been had
I'm a real bitch, you a fake bitch, red flag (red flag)
What you doing? Nothing, shit, making hoes mad
Bitch, I just signed with QC and got a big bag (big bag)
And finna show you why these ratchet bitches real bad
Watch me take yo' nigga, like I take his dick
He want dog ass bitch, until I show him some tricks
I'm a big dog bitch, don't compare me to simps (don't compare new ho')
My two kids was born rich, why you work at a temp?
I'm a real bitch (real bitch), don't fall
Fuck a nigga, get paid, that's code
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
I'm a real bitch (real bitch), don't fall
Fuck a nigga, get paid, that's code
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
My neck and my wrist
He ain't gotta check, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Doggin' these niggas everytime that I speak
Say he want Lakeyah, I done came up on a lick
Ice out my neck, and my wrist
He ain't gotta check, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Doggin' these niggas everytime that I speak
Say he want Lakeyah, I done came up on a lick
Nigga, run me that shit
