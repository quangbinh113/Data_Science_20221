Song Name: Sex Sounds
Mmh
Feels so good
Pussy blow me away
Mmm, blow me away
The way you kiss me when I'm strokin' deep inside of it
I swear you ride it so good (so good)
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
By the way you twitch your face
While I'm strokin' in and out
Girl, you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like how?
First I met you on the 'gram
I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different
'Cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need
You know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes
Baby, let me pull your dress down (dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (neck down)
Have you screaming, ooh
Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming, ooh, sex sounds
Baby, I need you in my life
It's like there's no one there, nobody
Can I turn to you next time, there's no one there
I need that girl to match my loyalty
When times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well
You don't give a fuck, about them
Let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world
Fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today
Baby, let me put your dress down (dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (neck down)
Have you screaming, ooh
Baby, just let me pull your dress down (dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (neck down)
Have you screaming, ooh, sex sounds
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Dress down, dress down
Oh
