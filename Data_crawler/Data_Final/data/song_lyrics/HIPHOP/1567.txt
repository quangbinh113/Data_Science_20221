Song Name: Fly N Ghetto
(Quadro)
Girl, you fly and ghetto
With them brand new high-heel stilettos
Smell like weed and rose petals
Heard you a rock star, heavy metal
Well, I'm a pop star, let's get together
Ice ya neck up, change the weather
She a hot one, like a pepper
And you fly girl, shake your feathers
You in my world
And the wheels keep goin'
What's on my mind is what got me feelin' lonely
Can't tell the time on my 30 thousand dollar rollie
But we gon' watch it shine you already know what's goin'
And the wheels keep turnin'
She hit my phone, but it's way too early
I swear are you watching me, I swear that you watching me
Girl you fly and ghetto
With them brand new high-heel stilettos
Smell like weed and rose petals
Heard you a rock star, heavy metal
Well, I'm a pop star, let's get together
Ice ya neck up, change the weather
She a hot one, like a pepper
And you fly girl, shake your feathers
You in my world
Better hold your horses
Don't spill your drink on my brand new Forces
We eat big meals, we doin' full courses
Keep talking slick, then you gonna get some corpse in
Uh, yeah, we tote them weapons
It go, "Doo, doo, doo!" and you don't hear nothin'
I'm tryna put some spread on the goddamn muffin
I got you riled up from the kissing and the touchin'
She like the stars on the roof
We can disappear in the wind like poof
Tough lil' cookie, you the mother fuckin' truth (yeah)
Girl you fly and ghetto
With them brand new high-heel stilettos
Smell like weed and rose petals
Heard you a rock star, heavy metal
Well, I'm a pop star, let's get together
Ice ya neck up, change the weather
She a hot one, like a pepper
And you fly girl, shake your feathers
You in my world
