Song Name: Touchscreen Navigation - From Swaecation
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation
Get me to my destination
If you can't get over me
It's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like what? (Hey)
Like what's the occasion?
Dunked a girl in the pool
There's plenty room in my SUV when I'm on the avenue
Rich bitch, I'm on to you
If it's mine, it ain't up for grabs
I make 'em pay me in cash
If the last didn't last
It's 'cause they didn't love you like they should have
So I'll get you from the train station
Know you don't mind, so I'll have the tree waiting
If it's on my mind then it's on yours too
I'll make the first move
And I guarantee you'll call me back, yeah
Cupid got a bounty on me (on me)
Trouble done found you
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (ooh)
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (yeah)
And I was homesick these past Februarys
Runnin' around hopin' payback was sweet
Money up, now we really flexin'
I take it out of park like-
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation
Get me to my destination
If you can't get over me
It's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey)
Like what's the occasion?
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation
Get me to my destination
If you can't get over me
It's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey)
Like what's the occasion?
