Song Name: Bottle Girls (feat. Polo G & Almighty Jay)
XO think he all that
I lose my mind everytime I think about you leaving again (Leaving)
I wanted love but the love don't feel the same in the end (End, end)
Caught in my feelings, you could tell it's kinda hard to pretend
You caught me cheating behind your back (Back)
What type of loyalty is that? (That)
But I know you want me back (Know you want me back)
Act like you don't know you all for sure, I know that's cap (That's cap)
I can't see you leaving me and starting over from scratch (Yeah)
Bentley key inside your purse, the same one in my bag (Bag)
But mine is black and yours is white, so somehow they don't match (Don't match)
Try to tell you that you're perfect without telling you you're perfect (Telling you you're perfect)
Must be dreaming cause the girl I'm dream about right here in person (Person)
Just tell me all your problems cause eventually they worsen (They worsen)
Just wanted to make sure you knew your purpose
But we all grown up (All grown up)
Caught inside your feelings, now they all blown up (All blown up)
I wanted to give you the world, the world (Give the world)
Then fell in love with bottle girls, the girls (With bottle girls)
Yeah, I understand it but we all grown up (All grown up)
Caught inside your feelings, now they all blown up (All blown up)
I wanted to give you the world, the world (Give the world)
Then fell in love with bottle girls, the girls (Fell in love with bottle girls) (Uh, uh)
Fell in love with bottle girls all them club nights
Now we distant strangers, used to be the one I hug tight
Feel like my heart in danger, tryna figure out my love life
Know it's over, if you fuck up, you can't find the one twice
Remember our first time, that moment was so special
Candles lit, hotel, I'm picking off rose petals
Tour dates, on sale, fit you in my lone schedule
If you ever walk away, I hope that my soul catch you
Baby, I been running in them streets nonstop
And I believe in you like I believe in my Glock
Now we all grown up, it got me thinking a lot
Should we keep this bond, like do I need it or not?
But we all grown up (All grown up)
Caught inside your feelings, now they all blown up (All blown up)
I wanted to give you the world, the world (Give you the world)
Then fell in love with bottle girls, the girls (With bottle girls)
Yeah, I understand it but we all grown up (All grown up)
Caught inside your feelings, now they all blown up (All blown up)
I wanted to give you the world, the world (Give you the world)
Then fell in love with bottle girls, the girls (Fell in love with bottle girls)(yeah,yeah)
