Song Name: No Return (with The Kid LAROI & Lil Durk)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Used to hit the block and serve, work the rock like Kyrie Irv'
Link up with gang like what's the word?
Pull up, skrrt, switchin' lanes, might jump the curb
And, yeah, bitch, I'm really him, put that on five, fuck what you heard
Got three fifties, that's one-fifty, ain't no limit, I fuck with Herb
Lil' kids turned grown men, we come from cribs dysfunctional
Gotta learn how to play your own hand, don't never get too comfortable
That's lil' shit, he can think he hot 'til them real killers come and humble you
All day, tell 'em spin the block 'til your best friend layin' under you
Know 'bout late nights and that hunger
Know 'bout rainy days and that thunder
I know lil' niggas on slime shit, know young thugs and gunners
We was in the field, Glock kick back, we gon' kick it off like punters
I'm too Turnt Gang, got five in me, I ain't never been no runner (bitch)
I can't ever go back to the way shit was
I done really came from nothing, now I got everything that I want
I can't ever go back to the way shit was
I done came too far, put that on everything I love
Roaches in the crib, mama on drugs
I can't let it go back to the way that it was
I can't never go back
I can't never, I can't never, I can't never, I can't never, oh
I come from the muddiest part of the trenches, where niggas'll die any day
Niggas into it with you, but niggas gon' hang and click and be in the way (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd rather be on the case and stay in the mix than be in a nigga case (be in a nigga case)
I don't sneak diss, the shit I tell my dog the shit I'll say in your face (say in a nigga face)
Perc' got fentanyl on 'em, he still want him a sixty (want him a sixty)
I took my brother Ruger and told him think and I gave him a .50
That backdoor cool where I'm from, that shit new in the city (oh, oh, oh)
And y'all be hangin' and playin' the game together, you know you snitchin' (oh, oh, oh)
I be tired of losing my niggas to niggas who new to killin' (new to killin')
Threw up my guts, I seen that footage, you don't know that feeling (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't hang with my niggas, homies dolo, I don't know them niggas (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why they play with me on I. G. like we lame? They know we killers, nigga
I can't ever go back to the way shit was
I done really came from nothing, now I got everything that I want
I can't ever go back to the way shit was
I done came too far, put that on everything I love
Roaches in the crib, mama on drugs
I can't let it go back to the way that it was
I can't never go back
I can't never, I can't never, I can't never, I can't never, oh
