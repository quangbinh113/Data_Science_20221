Song Name: Guardian angel
Oh-oh, lost
Don't take my heart
No, it's me, anything I, anything I
Oh-oh, lost
Don't take my heart
No, it's me, anything I (yeah), anything I
Listen close, what is this?
Is it heart break?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feeling like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with
Your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry
I guess I'm at a loss for words
To feel so close to someone, and finding they're gone the next day

I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is
