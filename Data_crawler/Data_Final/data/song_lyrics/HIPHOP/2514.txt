Violation
Uh huh huh
(Dizz you violated) Yeah, yeah
Don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it
Don't play wit' it (Muah, uh-huh)
I just wanna rough neck nigga on the tongue (Big mad)
Bitches wanna see me automatic wit' a drum (Grrt, grrt, grrt)
Ask me if I'm finished, nah, bitch, I just begun
Nah, I ain't givin' out no nutty to no nigga just for fun, are you dumb? (Uh-uh)
Runnin' man, I don't know no other man (Run it up, run it up)
You fuck like a hundred niggas just for hundred bands (What?)
I don't even got me hundred bands (Shit)
I'm still gon' me a hundred m's wit' a hundred plans
Gimme beso (Muah), Extendo (Grrah)
I carry bitches like I'm prego (Bop-bop, bop-bop)
Peter out wit' a nigga called Pedro (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
Sucker nigga, should've knew it from the get-go (Uh, yeah)
Don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it
Come on, baby, don't play wit' it (Don't play wit' it, muah)
Just lay in it (Ooh), spend all day in it (Ugh-ugh, ugh-ugh)
My hitters don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it (Grr)
Thеy stay wit' it, I'm okay wit' it (Yo)
(It's Billy) When it comes to me thеy don't play wit' it
Glitzy on me, yeah, that's somethin' that stay wit' (Somethin' that stay wit')
Them Brooklyn bitches, they ain't really nothin' to play wit'
Bitches steady chattin', when I run down, she ain't say shit
My hitters gon' bang quick, fuck around, it gets dangerous
Bitches actin' like a bimbos, stomp a bitch in my timbos
Hoes know I ain't playin' games, no Xbox, Nintendo (Nah)
Real bitch, no false shit, I stand on it, that's ten toes (Toes)
Pulled up in a big body wit' the dark tints on the windows
He said, "She so sweet," make him wanna lick the wrapper
Let him taste the pussy, then I kick him out right after (Bye)
Got these niggas vex, 'cause I curve them when I want
Get his wig pushed back, if the nigga tries to front like (Uh, yeah)
Don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it
Come on, baby, don't play wit' it (Don't play wit' it, muah)
Just lay in it (Ooh), spend all day in it (Ugh-ugh, ugh-ugh)
My hitters don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it, don't play wit' it (Grr)
They stay wit' it, I'm okay wit' it (Uh-huh)
When it comes to me they don't play wit' it (Muah)
