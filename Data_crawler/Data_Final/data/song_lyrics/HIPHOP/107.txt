Song Name: love yourself (interlude)
Hello?
What you doing?
Laying in a bikini
You straight?
Yeah I'm okay, what are you doing?
I'm in the studio
Ooh, ahh, love yourself
Take no chances, fuck that nigga
I say, ooh
Ooh, ahh, love yourself
Take no chances, fuck that nigga
I say, ooh, ahh
Stop lying
No
