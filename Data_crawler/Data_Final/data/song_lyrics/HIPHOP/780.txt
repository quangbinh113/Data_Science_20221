Song Name: The Voice
Turn me up, Josh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong
I was tired, they didn't realize
Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site
Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate, tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets, and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets, and them people ain't believe in me
Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him 39 years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate, tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets, and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets, and them people ain't believe in me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
