Song Name: "42" - From SR3MM
Yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Word
Uh, uh
European size, that's a 42
Left from the scene being cordial (yeah)
European bitch paying more than you
Young nigga hot, that's scorching (I'm hot)
Walk in the store, that's a shoe sale (sweater)
And all my bitches get Chanel (shit now)
Drop the top and they eyes super glued (drop it)
Fuck the check up, that's how we do (fuck it up)
MILFs fucking with me like I'm 42 (hey)
Baby ass soft, that's gucci goo (ooh)
In the new lou, skip to my lou
Whipping up checks like tofu (whip it)
Gone, but I'm back in a few
Plush carpet, got no shoes
In a one-seater with no room
Do a donut, then swoop (scurr)
Drop a nigga cash like: Oops
Smoking on loud, go mute (smoke)
Eating my meals like stew (ooh)
Making that bitch look cute
Picking these cars like fruit
Picking these girls like fruit
Super sweet for a spa day, and I wan' fuck a masseuse
Me and my juvies, divvy it up with the juvies
The money a discus, just by the way that I threw it
VVS movin'
Sir, you better cool it (yah)
Engine is vroomin'
In other words, bitch I'm zoomin'
European size, that's a 42
Left from the scene being cordial
European bitch paying more than you
Young nigga hot, that's scorching
Walk in the store, that's a shoe sale
And all my bitches get Chanel
Drop the top and they eyes super glued
Fuck the check up, that's how we do
European size bitch, 42
European move in a Bentley Coupe
And I'm gettin' head like shampoo
Cop some ice, you can brag too (ey)
My cash do the same thing the grass do
If her ass got bounce, it's a natural
Valentino boots, had to snag 'em
I be throwin' bands like a tantrum
Nigga so goofy, I'm laughin' (ey)
Might buy that watch with my back end
Leave out the mall with baggage
Foreign car, stoppin' up traffic
Ayy, I ain't cappin'
Shoes with the hoes, that was back then
Rollin' big blunts, not passin'
Gotta keep a slut for the action
And I can't let them squares in my circle
Private plane and I don't do commercial
All my niggas gon' get it, no turtles
Having kids with the money, I'm fertile
Roll me up a backwood of that purple
Got them Gucci shades on like I'm Urkel
Got the European drip like I'm Virgil (ey)
European size, that's a 42
Left from the scene being cordial (yeah)
European bitch paying more than you
Young nigga hot, that's scorching (I'm hot)
Walk in the store, that's a shoe sale (sweater)
And all my bitches get Chanel
Drop the top and they eyes super glued (drop it)
Fuck the check up, that's how we do (fuck it up)
In the front seat, giving more juice
Send me that rum, not Grey Goose
Nigga, y'all lookin' like sore losers
It's a straight shot, oops, I mean straight shooter
I chief and I cough up a gasbag
Throw cash, I don't care where it land at
Louis V lookin' like grab bag
My pockets really stuffed, like jam packed
I go continent to continent (yeah)
Got a bitch in every continent
I'ma buy the whole store, call it shop lift
Telemundo, they watchin' it
Supa' G's for the lottery
It's increasing our bottom end
Yeah the boss niggas coppin' it
Care less if it cost a bit
Let me Tokyo Drift
Let me six-gear shift
Bought my bitch a new Range Rover
And a big box of chocolate
Go pack up that old lifestyle
Baby, my life's too wild
Fuckin' that bitch for a while
Diamonds they hit like wow
European size, that's a 42
Left from the scene being cordial (yeah)
European bitch paying more than you
Young nigga hot, that's scorching (I'm hot)
Walk in the store, that's a shoe sale (sweater)
And all my bitches get Chanel
Drop the top and they eyes super glued (drop it)
Fuck the check up, that's how we do (fuck it up)
That's how we do
That's how we do
European size, that's a 42
European size, that's a 42
