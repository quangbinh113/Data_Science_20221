Song Name: GONE, GONE / THANK YOU
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
A bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (uh) instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is all I got
I just hope to God she got the taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
You kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
You kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
You kept me going (gone, gone, gone), the Band-Aid is falling off now
Going, and now I'm scarred for life
My love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)
My love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave lesson taught
See the weatherman told me that it was raining
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
E'rybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again
(Got my eye)
I said go, go
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again (again)
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever want to fall in love again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again

(Got my eye)
