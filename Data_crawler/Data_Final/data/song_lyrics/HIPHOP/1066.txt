Song Name: Lord I Need You
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with Your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
I give up on doin' things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes, or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink
We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at 16, I could barely afford an Audi
How you gonna try to say sometimes it's not about me
Man, I don't know what I would do without me
Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time went silence, a luxury
Cussin' at your baby momma, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)
Your gun off safety, speak first don't break me
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
Harsh words, you're angry

Lord, don't take me, oh, oh
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
I give up on doin' things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord) (Wheezy outta here)
