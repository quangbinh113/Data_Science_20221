Song Name: Talk To Me Nice (Feat. Meek Mill, Moneybagg Yo & Blxst)
Meek Milly, uh
I'm gettin' head in my Lambo' (Lambo')
Too many stitch in my bando (yeah)
All we touch is that brick talk (brick talk)
Nigga Kyrie with the handles (skrr, skrr)
Everybody poppin', it's lit shit (lit shit)
'Til we come blow out your candles (brr)
Young nigga poppin' that big shit (big shit)
And it stay shinin' like a sandal, woah, wait (shee)
Chanel on my bitch
Ain't gotta tell you to tell that I'm rich
Get out of pocket, we murder your dawg
Full stop barkin' and turn him a vic
Spin on the opps, we gon' murder the boss
I put the call and they comin' to hit
Strappin' like we never heard of the law
One thing about me, I'm never gon' snitch (huh)
You was just talkin' like?, fuck is you doin'? Aw, man (fuck is you doin'? Aw, man)
I've been in the trap all week, niggas cookin' popcorn and selling hot tea (yeah)
Shawty wanna Netflix, chill, I don't really wanna kick it, Van Damme (yеah)
I'm the type to fuck a bad bitch first night, then kick thе ho out like Pam
Ayy (ayy)
I'm too big headed to take your advice
So talk to me nice
Might design her the couch and fuck up your wife
We do what we like (yeah)
This opp here, might blow through bags, yeah
To fuck up a life (to fuck up a life)
The diamonds done came with a birth certificate, ain't overnight
Fifty pack, all blueface (blueface)
It come a few ways, yeah, yeah
I go too cray, if I do say so myself
This my new bae, she go two way, well, well
I go too cray, if I do say so myself
Where the steppers at? (Where the steppers at?)
I came to step on shit (step on shit)
Where the weapons at? (Where the weapons at?)
I'm on my effin' shit (effin' shit)
Been had the fifty clip
He went on my second shit
This album got Ye on it, startin' to feel like a testament
I'm throw the money bags, yo, that's why my section lit
And you can tell which one of these hoes just gave me head, she suckin' on peppermints
Grammy nominated, forty million records sold
That's not what a legend is
The Draco was camouflage, 'cause outside of the Fendi it's leopard print
Niggas still smokin' Chronic? Pfft
I got a bitch in the Netherlands, all out of element
Took her to Dr. Miami and now she look better than Evelyn
She got a Drac' too, swingin' like it's the trunk on a elephant
I fucked her on day two, hot sauce in the condom, we killin' the evidence
They killin' rap niggas, I'm losin' competitors
I pull up in a red Rolls, stop givin' flowers to niggas I'm better than
Me versus everybody, nigga, it is what I said it is
And you know I'm gang related, let us in
I came with my relatives and tonight
Ayy (ayy)
I'm too big headed to take your advice
So talk to me nice
Might design her the couch and fuck up your wife
We do what we like (yeah)
This opp here, might blow through bags, yeah
To fuck up a life (to fuck up a life)
The diamonds done came with a birth certificate, ain't overnight
Fifty pack, all blueface (blueface)
It come a few ways, yeah, yeah
I go too cray, if I do say so myself
This my new bae, she go two way, well, well
I go too cray, if I do say so myself
Talk to me nice, lil' bitch
I'm loaded, don't ask for the price of shit (don't do that)
Too player, it's in me not on me, I'll stick knock a ho in a Nike fit (yeah, yeah)
Put on for my clique, I'm real as it gets, 'fore I purchased the drank, I gave her the kids
Had to make sure it's right (mwah)
They tryna say we bipolar (why?)
Me and this Glock gotta quit
Fifty some racks for a six hours flight, just to turn back around, I'ma be back tonight
Talk to me nice, you don't get a me twice (nah)
Fuck all them blogs tryna use me for hype (lil' bitch)
In the bando with no lights where you find us (been trappin')
We was just mindin' us (locked in)
Money in front of me, bullshit behind us (focus)
We just vibin', don't mind us (yeah, yeah)
Bloody Lamborghini Urus, she was moppin' while I'm steerin'
AR pistol, I'm insured
Won't let you take me from my children
Choppas, brr, brr, VVS is chillin', brr
No cup, all I sip is is purp
Fly before I board the nerd (big Bagg)
