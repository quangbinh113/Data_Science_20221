Song Name: EYE EYE EYE (feat. Kevin Abstract)
(Donnie Katana)
Eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye (let's go)
What you know about this shit?
Run around town with the Bloods and the Crips (shh)
Let's lay low (go)
Nigga touch me, hands high, got a halo, halo, halo, halo
Got a new bitch everywhere like zip codes
And my new bitch lookin' like Jhené Aiko
Everywhere I go, there they go (go)
Give a fuck what them niggas say (fuck)
Cut 'em off with the blade, I know
Oh, she wanna fuck with all my bros
Yayo, yayo, she off the cocaine (woo)
Taking pills to take the pain away, she don't know her name (what's your name?)
Whoa, Tresha wanna get high, jumping out late night
Tryna get paid, everything not okay (go)
When I walk down, the chopper spray (yeah)
Bum nigga, get up out my way
I'ma blaze down the KKK
Fuck the world and the USA (let's go)
Whoa, Tresha wanna get high, jumping out late night
Tryna get paid, everything not okay
When I walk down, the chopper spray
Bum nigga, get up out my way
I'ma blaze down the KKK
Fuck the world and the USA (let's go)
Eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye (let's go)
What you know about this shit?
Run around town with the Bloods and the Crips (shh)
Let's lay low (go)
Nigga touch me, hands high, got a halo, halo, halo, halo
Got a new bitch everywhere like zip codes
And my new bitch lookin' like Jhené Aiko
Better let that plug in, don't disrespect that plug, man
That's my cousins, my motherfucking blood, bitch
You fucking up the function, fucking up the function
You fucking up the function
Fucking up the, fucking up the, fucking up my fun, man
These the streets I run, man
You can't tell me nothing, got just what I want, man
Still up off these drugs, man
Still up off these drugs, man
Still up off these drugs, man
Still up, up, up
Killing my vibe, you lucky I'm high
You treat me alright, I'm here for the night
I look in your eyes, your feelings not mine
You're sensitive baby, but your ass alright
I'm all for real, this me, for real
In ATL like D4L
I'm hardened steel, heartless still
This one finna hit the mark for real, real (real)
Eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye-eye (let's go)
What you know about this shit?
Run around town with the Bloods and the Crips (shh)
Let's lay low (go)
Nigga touch me, hands high, got a halo, halo, halo, halo
Got a new bitch everywhere like zip codes
And my new bitch lookin' like Jhené Aiko
It's me and Kevin Abstract, yeah
Yeah, this how we do it
