Song Name: Stay High
Ayy, I been asleep off the lean all day, it's like fuckin' mornin'
It already feel like it's nine in the mornin'

Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my
Count the racks up, I got my stacks up
Bad lil' bitch, tell her back up
In the cut with the MAC tucked
Run up on me, get hit up
Ambulance, need to pick him up, uh
Six shots to the head like, woah
Run through the six, no woes
Throw money, throw hands, throw bowls
Up, down, left, right, A, B, cheat codes
Pull up, my gun sing like Glee show
Rick Owen on my coat, no superhero
VVS my wrist like Sub Zero
Play a bitch like guitar, no hero
Run the money up, stack it like Legos
Bad bitch wanna fuck, I say let's go, uh
R.I.P to my niggas gone
Sometimes I wish I could hit your phone
I don't really wanna walk through life alone
Ain't too many real niggas here no more
I lost my woadie, my heart cold
Now, I gotta walk through life alone
Now, I gotta walk through life alone
Now, I gotta live this life alone
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my
Wockhardt in my body, I can't help myself
I get so damn high that I can't feel myself
My girlfriend worried about me, think I'm gon' kill myself
Sorry, baby, I'm just really tryna feel myself
Keep my head above the water while I drown in wealth
I got that drip like Gunna, I may drip or drown myself
You know I love choppers, I had to surround myself
Takin' Gelato to the head, smoked the pound myself
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my-
