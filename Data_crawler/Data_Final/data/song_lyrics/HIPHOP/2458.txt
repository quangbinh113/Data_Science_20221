You gon' make me pull a you on you
You got a bitch, I got a nigga, so I guess we playin' two on two
Swear you guilty of everything you say I do
What I do, it ain't your business when they ask, "You belong to who?"
You gon' make me pull a you on you
You gon' make me pull a you on you
Oh, you thought you was playing me? Guess what? I play too (I could do that)
Played dumb so you'd thought that I'd never play you
I ain't the type that's gon' sit around crying
When I know good and damn well you lying (I know you lying)
Every time my phone ring, it say Brittany, it be Tim
And I know your ass be cappin' like a brim (Cap)
And you know your partner Slim? (Yeah)
The one that drive the Hellcat with the rims? (I like that)
He be working me out when I say I'm at the gym
We on the same thing
You blaming me, I'm blaming you, that's just the blame game (That's how it go)
Yeah, it's a two-way street, we in the same lane
Play you 'fore you play me, that's just my mind frame (That's how I think)
But you still mine, bae
You gon' make me pull a you on you
You got a bitch, I got a nigga, so I guess we playin' two on two
Swear you guilty of everything you say I do
What I do, it ain't your business when they ask, "You belong to who?"
You gon' make me pull a you on you
You gon' make me pull a you on you
Uh, she said, "Hey twin"
If you gon' do the shit I do, you better do it big then
Better yet, this shit might be my fault but we ain't gon' talk 'bout what I did
I say, "Pull up," she drop the pin, I'm thinking with my dick again
Licked out her tongue and did a spin (Yeah)
Told you it wasn't nothing, we was just friends (I'm lying)
She like, "You lying again"
And I say, "I'm sorry, girl, let's try this again"
I'm your love point guard, I'ma shoot my shot
She said I'm toxic, you acting like you not
And she so like that, that head be super fire
She know that pussy bite back, got me like "Ooh, it's hot"
So I'm like, yeah, you probably got a few chances if you nasty
If you can't give me good head, then you can vanish
I would've gave her a Plan B, but I planned it
I'm so nasty
This nigga stupid (Dumbass)
He swear I'm playing him, but he can't prove it (He can't prove shit)
If you did it, what make you think that I can't do it? ('Cause I can do it too)
Better catch me if you can before you lose me, can't have me looking me stupid
Nah, I'm too discrete (Damn)
Nah, you tried to tell me you was for the streets (I should've listened)
Everything I say you did, I got receipts (I got receipts)
Shit you tried to hide, I already seen (Seen that shit)
Always heard love is blind, but I'm not Eve (Tuh)
Far from na√Øve (Tuh), fuck you mean?
The realest on your team, shit, we in the same lane
Play you 'fore you play me, that's just my mind frame (That's how I think)
But you still mine, bae
You gon' make me pull a you on you
You got a bitch, I got a nigga, so I guess we playin' two on two
Swear you guilty of everything you say I do
What I do, it ain't your business when they ask, "You belong to who?"
You gon' make me pull a you on you
You gon' make me pull a you on you
