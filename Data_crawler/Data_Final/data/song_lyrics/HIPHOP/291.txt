Big fish
Another one

DJ Khaled
Drop top gone (Drop top gone)
Sellin' popcorn (Sellin' popcorn)
I went from licks to most wanted to the top of the Forbes
Fucked up the trenches (Fucked up the trenches)
I weather the storm (Weather that shit)
Young living legend, I be on that shit that these niggas ain't on (Niggas ain't on)
I went to war with the system (Yeah)
To give my son toys on Christmas (Yeah)
Probably won't give me no Grammy (Give me that)
Putting awards on wrists (Yeah)
We had to kill just to make it out
Shit, we puttin' rewards on niggas (Brrt)
Live by the gun and we die about it
Shit, I'm prayin' the sword don't kill us
Prayin' the Lord forgive us, we going to war with killers
They put a bounty all on my dawgs, want 'em dead by morning, nigga
We took risks to live like this, ain't doing consignment (Doing consignment)
I brought my mama tears, and I turned 'em to VVS diamonds (VVS diamonds)
I know you see me on top of my game, ain't see me declinin' (See me declinin')
Turned to a monster, the next time you saw me
You seen I was climbin' (Seen I was climbin')
They took my elevator, I said fuck it
I'm takin' the steps (Takin' the steps)
Got me on bail, they want me in jail, they say I'm a threat (Say I'm a threat)
Fighting for freedom eleven years, they been takin' my breath (Taking my breath)
Watchin' the feds taking pictures, it been makin' me stress (Makin' me sweat)
Tappin' my phone, takin' my rights, and makin' 'em wrong
Deep in this shit, had to dance with the devil to make it back home, yeah
I got a call from one of the dawgs, say, "You been ridin' private"
He say I should tell the pilot to come and get him
And the crazy part about it, my nigga sittin' in a prison
And the other crazy part about it, I really know that feelin', yeah
I can't put my trust inside the system
Gotta be here for my sisters
And my niece believe in Christmas
And her dad, somebody killed him
Some shit I don't remember
'Cause I left him in a box when they had me in them locks
I blame God for my convictions
Never give a judge that ammunition
Never had no co-defendants
God gon' be my only witness
Never take it personal, it's whatever when we handlin' business
We been through the worst, them situations we can never mention
You gon' have your mom losin' her mind if you get a conviction
Got some homies sittin' in the feds, hope they get an eviction
Prayin' to his gun, he got his fire, he ain't got no religion
I heard Meek got two for a wheelie and I was in the kitchen servin'
Had me thinkin', is it all worth it?
Thinkin' 'bout the chances that I took to buy you purses
Thinkin' 'bout them licks that we went on and just go splurge it
Switched it up and everythin' been workin'
