Song Name: Beautiful Pain (Losin My Mind)
This beat from Murda
Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry
I was sittin' there just thinkin', then reality, it hit me
Hope I feel your same pain when that bitch Karma come and get me
Feel like I don't deserve you no more, but I want you to be with me
We done built a bond so strong, and from that love, I know you miss me
Connected to your soul, I feel it when you hug and kiss me
Now your shoulder is so cold and lately, I been feelin' empty
I got caught up in this fame and all these hoes, I let it tempt me
In that hotel room alone, remember I would hold you gently
Went on dates, we took some pictures, everything was movin' quickly
Manipulated, I ain't think a new relationship would fit me
But I told you we can try it, even though I know it's risky
Mind games with our emotions, swear this shit get kinda tricky
Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry
Keep her in Love PINK 'cause I like how them joggers fit her
Wonderin' how I'ma play it, it was hard to get her
So beautiful, I keep her smilin' when I compliment her
If bein' this bad is a sin, I hope that God forgive her
Just had a son, I'm tryna be the perfect father figure
I kept you worried, in them trenches tryna dodge the killers
Tryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger
It's hard to love with dysfunction, wish my scars was thinner
Tryna forgive me in your thoughts, I hope your heart remember
Know it's gon' hurt to see another nigga bondin' with her
Can't even look you in your eyes 'cause I'm burnin' up with guilt
For that one moment, went too far, and now I fucked up what we built
Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry
