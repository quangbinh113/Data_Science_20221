You know I had to cop that shit just by the twos
Blood in my chakra, I will not pop at ya
Put money on my head just for your album, bruh
Tell me, lil' boy, if it's beef I can chop this shit up

Four years, I ain't even see a mouse
Please stop talkin', bitch, put dick in your mouth

Had to tell that lil' bitch get from around
'Cause that little bitch be fuckin' with clowns
Let's go, let's go, yeah, had to tell that lil' bitch, yeah, let's go (let's go, let's go)
That lil' nigga stole my swag and he tried to steal my flow (my flow, my flow)
I had to switch it up one time just like I switch my phone (my phone, my phone)
I could try one more time, I can give this shit one more go (let's go, ayy)

That's the reason he tryna say that I'm gay (ayy)
Way more coochie than Kay Slay (ayy)
I sell a mil' in a day (ayy)
All of my bitches they grade A
I do not get it in Canada, but when I'm in Toronto they treat me like Drake
This a light jet, this a flight day
Had that lil' bitch, that's on MySpace
