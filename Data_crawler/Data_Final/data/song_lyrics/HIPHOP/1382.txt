Song Name: WIG (with Moneybagg Yo)
It's summer, bitches, get your lace fronts now, hoes
'Cause if you don't got a wig you ain't doing it (I hate you)
Next year is you natural bitches time
Uh, come back next year, baby (ah)
2022, get you a wig in your hair
What the fuck, bitch? Okay
(ATL Jacob, he a fuckin' millionaire)
My bitch got a wig in her hair (uh)
But she still a ten (yeah)
It's enough room for her to sleep up in there
But I'm too turnt to sleep in a Benz (let's go)
If them niggas don't work, then go eat by yourself
You can't keep up by feedin' your friends (no)
Bein' a dummy, that don't make you real
Better keep you some money, don't blow your lil' deal (yeah)
Yeah, you pro'ly young and turnt, make the hoes go crazy
Don't focus on the long run, baby
Fuck on them hoes, make sure they turnt at your show (yeah)
Go get your cake, make sure you turn up some more
Soon as you see them fuck niggas hate
Pull out your fire, rather you leave out dead or alive (la-la, la)
You ain't let niggas play with your name (la-la, la)
I was out here sellin' big pounds out the trash bag
Ten at a time, you was playin' the game
Fuck on that hoe, she was sayin' my name
Takin' lil' selfies, keep wearin' my chain (la-la, la)
Jumped in my Rolls and gave me some brain
Told him she messed up her hair in the rain
He like to trick on her, spend a lil' change
He think he slicker than her 'cause he lame
Yeah, he think he slicker than her, he a dub
One thing about a bad bitch, if you ever had one, nigga, they slicker than us (yeah)
You ain't never gotta lie to me, baby, I ain't trippin', speakin' of trip, try your luck
She might come on a plane, she try me like a lame, she gon' get on a bus (wow)
My bitch got a wig in her hair (yeah)
But she still a ten (ten)
It's enough room for her to sleep up in there
But I'm too turnt to sleep in a Benz (too turnt to sleep in a Benz)
If them niggas don't work, then go eat by yourself
You can't keep up by feedin' your friends (no)
Bein' a dummy, that don't make you real
Better keep you some money, don't blow your lil' deal (yeah)
My bitch got a wig in her hair
My bitch got a wig, yeah (wig, wig)
Yeah, uh, my bitch still a ten with that (wig, wig)
Shakin' her ass with her friends (wig, wig)
My bitch still a ten with that shit (wig, wig)
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, with that (wig, wig, wig, wig)
Shakin' her ass with them friends (wig, wig, wig, wig)
(Go) ooh, I wish I would spend my hard-earned money on a bitch plane ticket and she don't wanna fuck (what?)
I ain't know nice-ass nigga, I ain't tryna ugh-ugh, I'ma get you a Uber, no truck
Told her, "This ain't my house anyway, just a lil' feel safe" case a hoe try to pull back up (sike)
Put another bitch on the first thing, smokin' (flight)
Know a nigga had to keep some on tuck (fight)
Might pull out, nut on her booty, then go back in
I been that nigga since way back then
Pull up today, it's a Maybach Benz
Switch on the glizzy, I'm never lackin'
Show full of Mexicans, too packed in
Comin' through Memphis, you better tap in (facts)
My bitch is a ten with or without a weave, what about yours, nigga? (Huh?)
She got more cars and chains than rappers
That's what you get when you fuck with a hitta
My hand been itchin', I'm flyin' to Vegas
Might duck off and spend a weekend at the villa
Face card valid from AM to PM
Money to blow, got a eight-figure pillow
My bitch got a wig in her hair (bad)
But she still a ten (ten)
It's enough room for her to sleep up in there
But I'm too turnt to sleep in a Benz (too turnt to sleep in a Benz)
If them niggas don't work, then go eat by yourself
You can't keep up by feedin' your friends (no)
Bein' a dummy, that don't make you real
Better keep you some money, don't blow your lil' deal (yeah)
My bitch got a wig in her hair
My bitch got a wig, yeah (wig, wig)
Yeah, uh, my bitch still a ten with that (wig, wig)
Shakin' her ass with her friends (wig, wig)
My bitch still a ten with that shit (wig, wig)
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, with that (wig, wig, wig, wig)
Shakin' her ass with them friends (wig, wig, wig, wig)
