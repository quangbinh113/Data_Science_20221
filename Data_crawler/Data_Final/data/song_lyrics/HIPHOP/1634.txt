Song Name: Save Me, Please
I'm, tired of the fighting
I'm, tired of the crying
Please, please come back in my arms, oh-oh
I'm, tired of trying
I'm, tired of dying
Please, please save me from myself, oh-oh
All out of luck, when you missin' me
All out of luck, when you distance me
All out of luck, reminiscin' me
All out of love, and tremendously
I'm here for you
I feel, I feel for you
I just know, my love is real for you, I just know (Oh-oh)
I'm, tired of the fighting
I'm, tired of the crying
Please, please come back in my arms, oh-oh
I'm, tired of trying
I'm, tired of dying
Please, please save me from myself, oh-oh
