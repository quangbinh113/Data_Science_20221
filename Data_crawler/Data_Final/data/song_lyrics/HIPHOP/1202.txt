Song Name: Lavender Sunflower
Sexy lady
What would you do?
If this goes right, girl
If everything goes how we planned it to
Sexy lady
What would you do?
If I was rubbing my hand on you?
Would it make you amused?
You electrify my body
Specify, I'm horny
Baby, after tonight we're going
Come and sexify my heart
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby loves me more)
What are you waiting for?
'Cause maybe her loving me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (and I don't wanna hurt her soul)
Tell me
What would you do?
If еverything felt right, she'd dim thе lights?
I bet you would what she tells you to
Oh, now sexy lady
What would you want to do?
If I laid my cards, left my girl
And stay with you?
You electrify my body
Specify, I'm horny
Baby, after tonight we're going
Come and sexify my heart
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby loves me more)
What are you waiting for?
'Cause maybe her loving me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (and I don't wanna hurt her soul)
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby loves me more)
What are you waiting for?
'Cause maybe her loving me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (don't wanna hurt her soul)
