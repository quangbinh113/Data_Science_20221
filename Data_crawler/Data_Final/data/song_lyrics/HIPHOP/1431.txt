Song Name: IYKYK (feat. Ella Mai & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie)
Tahj Money!
TouchofTrent Be Wilding With It
You Go Out With Your Friends
And Forget I'm Your Man
Girls Night Out Turn To A Fight
When You Do Come In
I Sent You A Text, act like
You Ain't See it But It said You Did
Half Your Friends Like Being Hoes
But They Ain't Got No Man
You Take Shots And Be On TikTok
That Got My D!ck Hot
I Can't Step Out Like I'm Regular
You Know I'm A Big Opp
Three Hundred Cash Sound Like A Ton
But That's Just For The Wrist Watch
I Got Ten Cars In My Garage
And You Can Drive The Big One
I See Your DM From Some N!ggas
Act Like They Don't DM
I Should Tell Them To Shoot They Shot
And Get Back For Their BM
But She Told Me, "Don't Say Too Much"
I Said, "I Am", She Said I Play Too Much
If I Tell, "I Love You" One Time
You Say, I Don't Say It Enough
If I Say It A Thousand Times
You Say I Say It Too Much
I Wanna Put My Tongue Inside
You Whenever I Lay On Your Butt
I'm Tryna Make You Say My Name
Whenever I Get In Your Guts
You Know Like I Know
Your Friends Act Like Hoes
And My Bros Act Like Hoes
But You Know How That Goes
I Tell You Every Time
Don't You Worry About My Friends
I Know You Know It's Nothing
I Don't Care About What They Saying
I Say Charge It To The Game
No, I'll Never Taint Your Name
I Ain't Never Ever Play About Ya
You Need Some Reassurance, I Can Do That For Ya
But Don't Ignore When I Say I Need The Same From Ya
And You Told Me I Be Doing Too Much
I Say, "I Know", But We Been Through It Enough
You Know Like I Know (I Know)
Your Friends Act Like Hoes (Oh! Oh)
And My Bros Act Like Hoes (Oh! Oh)
But You Know How That Goes
Every Hour Of The Day I Think Of You
And Every Time I Sleep, I Dream Of You
Ain't No Other Love Like Mine For You
Oh! Oh! You Know How That Goes
Every Hour Of The Day I Think Of You
And Every Time I Sleep, I Dream Of You
Ain't No Other Love Like Mine For You
Oh! Oh! You Know How That Goes
I Hear Some Of Your Friends Slide On They Old Hoes
Birds Flock Together, Why All Flew Out To Cabo
You Say You'll Always Be Loyal
How The Fu*k Should I Know?
She Want New Purses, And To Go Wherever I Go
Huh? I Told My Bro Don't You Move Like A Ho
I Don't Get Perkys No More
And N!ggas Only Buy They B!tches Flowers
Because Of Durkio
She On Her Period, Hit In The Shower
I Still Want It, Ho
Let Me Know If It's Uncomfortable
You Know Like I Know
Your Friends Act Like Hoes
And My Bros Act Like Hoes
But You Know How That Goes
