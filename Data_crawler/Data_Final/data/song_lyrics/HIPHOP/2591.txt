Song Name: Private Valet
Yo, don't ever call yourself a man if you can't keep your composure, nigga
Straight up (straight up), slow gang for you (slow gang for you)
Uh
Back on my shit, fresh off the tour bus (mad, uh)
Straight back to it (aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
Yeah, Lambo' Evo (right) press a couple buttons parked it right by the speed boat (sheesh)
Sipping on some real shit, touchdown Chi town, making a real bitch (Chi town)
Colored eyes brown skin (yeah) and you know she real thick
Another half a million dollars spent, but I sleep good
Talking big numbers (damn) with the bitch while I grip the wood
Check it out, only speak facts, so she hear me out
Heated toilets in the bathroom, sending emails out
She got a whole situation
But ready to risk it all
I ain't with the drama (damn)
When you ready, just givе me a call
I know I'm just checking the mail, but got that shit on (for real)
I'm a littlе younger than dude, but still big grown
Man, this game so cold (so cold, so cold)
It don't got no love for you, love for you, love for you
Man, this game so cold (so cold, so cold)
It don't got no love for you, love for you, love for you
Yeah, aye, aye, aye (yeah)
I can talk like (shuit it) this 'cause I live that
You niggas know my background, don't play with it
Hothead, short-tempered quick to tote the semi (the semi)
If you foggy in my city, can't be acting timid
Might do the mink (uh) with the midnight (yeah)
Doors open up on the Lamborghini like fisheye (aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
Nigga, this my new trap, vacuum-seal my adlibs and then I send them to the track
Man, this game so cold (so cold, so cold)
It don't got no love for you, love for you, love for you
Man, this game so cold (so cold, so cold)
It don't got no love for you, love for you, love for you
Yeah, aye, aye, aye
Can't stand no tear, nigga
Slide eyes on you
Most my niggas
Nigga, this my new trap, vacuum-seal my adlibs and then I send them to the track, wild
