Song Name: Narrow Road (feat. Lil Baby)
Cook that shit up, Quay
Top Shotta, Don Dada
Got the bombs like Al-Qaeda, uh
NLE the Top Shotta, yeah, yeah
I just copped the Range Rover (a big body)
With some Forgis (with some Forgiatos)
Sippin' codeine (codeine), feelin' like a dope fiend (a dope fiend)
He say I'm not a killer, that nigga don't know me (brrt)
My OG told me put in work when I was 14 (when I was 14)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
I'm goin' down a narrow ro-o, ro-o, ro-o-oad
They tell me, "Think smart" (think smart)
I know right from wrong (oh)
They tell me I'ma get life with this dirty chrome (get life)
Well, you would rather take a life
Before they take your own (the Don Dada)
And bitch, I been through some shit, I came from a broken home
I got a different mentality, bitch, it's kill or be killed (kill or, yeah)
I'd rather kill a rat before I write a statement and squeal (yeah, yeah)
It ain't no face up in my circle, real recognize real (yeah, yeah)
I kick that boy up out my cot that night that, I did my drills (yeah)
'Cause ayy, we are not the same (we are not the same)
I got murder, murder
Murder runnin' through my brain (it's runnin' through my brain)
And bitch, I'm hurt up inside
Piranhas swim through my veins (swim through my veins)
Put your feelings on the toilet
Watch it twirl down the drain (uh-huh, uh)
They askin' who I need?, well, I don't need shit (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only thing I need, is this Glock 23, bitch (grrt, grrt)
Flyin' overseas got a young nigga seasick
I was just posted in the street like some cement, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just copped the Range Rover (a big body)
With some Forgis (with some Forgiatos)
Sippin' codeine (codeine), feelin' like a dope fiend (a dope fiend)
He say I'm not a killer, that nigga don't know me (brrt)
My OG told me put in work when I was 14 (when I was 14)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-ad)
I'm goin' down a narrow ro-o, ro-o, ro-o-oad
Road gettin' narrow (nah), slimmer and slimmer (slim)
Pray to God that I forget, try my best not to remember (ah)
It's a cold, cold world and I was born in December
I'm forever steppin' forward, you know I'm one of the members
They try to tax us, SSI, then we start goin' and get 'em
Really show me what it was, I prolly never forgive you
Start havin' what you ain't had and they'll look at you different
But it don't matter, I'm in my bag, it's gettin' bigger and bigger
Now the Range Rover class Sport and stamps on my passport
Never know what trippin', I got everything I asked for
Youngin' out here robbin', I try to tell that nigga to mask up
We get all the bags around the way, niggas can't gas us
Ain't really got too much to say but fuck the task force
Keep mindin' my business, hold my weight, and run my cash up
Sometimes I just ride 'round with my stick inside my Lamb' truck
Everywhere I go, somebody put me on their cameras
I just copped the Range Rover (a big body)
With the Forgis (with some Forgiatos)
Sippin' codeine (codeine), feelin' like a dope fiend (a dope fiend)
He say I'm not a killer, that nigga don't know me (brrt)
My OG told me put in work when I was 14 (when I was 14)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-oad)
Goin' down a narrow ro-o-o-oad (a narrow ro-ad)
I'm goin' down a narrow ro-o, ro-o, ro-o-oad
A big body with some Forgiatos
Codeine, a dope fiend (brrt)
When I was 14
A narrow ro-oad, ayy
A narrow ro-o-oad
A narrow ro-oad, ayy
Ro-o-oad
