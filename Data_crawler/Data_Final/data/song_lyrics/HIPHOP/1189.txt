Song Name: Feline (with Polo G & Trippie Redd)
Got a new .9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides
Boy, your gang ain't your gang and your homies not your homies
Run it up, get that sack but do that shit right by your lonely
Choppa hit him with a force like I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi
Don't need no court to use my torch, I've been shootin' like I'm Kobe
I don't need nobody, I just need your body, ay, ayy
I'm gon' catch a body, if you fuck with my money, ay, ayy
Mixin' up narcotics, turned mе to a zombie
Ape with a nigga, Harambe
Pull up on a nigga, no talkin', lеave a nigga leakin', no faucet
Stand up to the opps, never back down
He'll get beat with the belt like it's SmackDown
Studio, juug life, trap house
Crack cocaine my track outs
Up late night like owls, Backwoods, smokin' no White Owls
I got the lean on me right now
Got a gun with a beam on me right now
Got a new .9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides
Get them niggas from 'round you if they won't ride
Lot of opps, they love to talk, but they don't slide
Gang'nem on Evergreen and hustlin', bitch, we don't hide
Can't be with new niggas, they bring around the wrong vibe
They put in years on that one with some real vest
Yo' boyfriend still on the porch, he ain't in the field yet
Them guns blatt, no hit and run, you get your grill rattled
You had it rough when you was young so I can feel that
That pain put anger in your heart, you wanna kill 'em all
I lost my nigga from the start, I hate I missed his call
If you stay loyal, play your part then you gon' get to ball
Fast lane, we never go and park, I just keep driftin' off
Got a new .9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides (yeah, yeah)
In a dream world rollin' with your dream girl
Said she love me but she won't leave me, she a fiend girl
I don't want her body, want her head, guillotine girl
Devil's always wearing Prada, wear some Celine, girl
Sorry bae, I ain't what you used to
I was raised up, heartless, I'm a loose screw
I'ma get all up in your head and seduce you
Chillin' with some niggas in the back that'll shoot at you, yeah
Ready, set, aim, I'ma blow your damn brain
If I hop out the car
And shoot the bitch at close range
We ain't playing both sides, choppa with me, .45
Just gon' hold like two knives, 'cause we 1400, 999
Got a new .9 that'll leave your mouth wide (wide)
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire (fire)
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die (die)
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try (try)
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline (feline)
Get your own business and get out mine (mine)
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time (time)
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides (sides)
