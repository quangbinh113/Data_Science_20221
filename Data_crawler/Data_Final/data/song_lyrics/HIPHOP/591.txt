Ayy, money on the way (Money on the way)
All I see is hundreds all day (All day)
Top chef, fish sauteed
Condo in L.A. (Ayy)
President Rollie with the date (President)
Pullin' out the foreigns, we can race (Mmm)
In and out of state (In and out of state)
Nah, we can not relate (We can not)
And, I gotta stay laced (I gotta stay laced)
She want us to date (Ah)
I see she keepin' faith (Faith)
Ah, I'ma make her wait (I'ma make her wait)
Nigga pillowtalk, I really set talk, we'll shoot the whole place
We ain't takin' loss, double M, drove boss
In the six-star loft cookin' fish parquet
Ice, no skates (Ice)
Get it out the pot (Get it out the pot)
Speed on the cops (Speed)
Feelin' like I'm Jigga on a yacht (Jigga on a yacht)
People wanna watch (Uh)
Milli' on the watch (Uh-huh)
It's a Richard Millie on a watch (Millie on a watch)
Ma ain't gotta cry, GunWanna made it out alive (GunWunna)
Seen a lot of real niggas die (Real niggas die)
Look him in the eye, you bad, let me see catch a fly (Girl)
The cash got these niggas wildin' out (Wild)
Rockstar, open up the circle, make a moshpit (Moshpit)
Swervin' on the Perkys made me car sick (Car sick)
Brothers don't cuff 'em, this is all our bitch (This is all our bitch)
Grew up in the trenches, we squabblin'
Make me quick to grab a choppa, start a World War 6 (World War 6)
Gunna got some millions and I barely feel rich (Barely feel rich)
They been here knockin' ringin'
And I don't know who it is (Don't know who it is)
Ayy, money on the way (Money on the way)
All I see is hundreds all day (All day)
Top chef, fish sauteed

Pullin' out the foreigns, we can race (Mmm)
In and out of state (In and out of state)
Nah, we can not relate (We can not)
And, I gotta stay laced (I gotta stay laced)
She want us to date (Ah)

Ah, I'ma make her wait (I'ma make her wait)
Remember I served
I was standin' on the curb with a bomb full of nicks (Bomb full of nicks)
It's my word (Yeah), I'm capped off Bird
I done seen a niggas jump from a slab to a brick (To a brick, on God)
Cute pink toe, I bit her on the toes
I fuck her like a hoe, I make a whole flick (Shit, make a whole flick)
Proud of baby girl, she can take a whole dick (Take a whole dick)
She told me she was thirsty
Started drinkin' my spit (Drinkin' my spit)
Ooh (Ooh), you ain't never heard this (This)
I been droppin' hits like bird shit (Brr)
They been sendin' threats, but don't worry (No)
We hoppin' in a rental with a dirty stick (Dirty stick)
They ain't give me my money
I'ma murder this bitch (Murder this bitch)
I'ma murder this bitch (Murder this bitch)
Rental off the Rollie, just went way in the ditch (Way in the ditch)
Young Gunna not no playa 'bout these chips (Wah)
We really used to struggle now we paid, filthy rich (Paid, filthy rich)
A hundred K to hit your VIP (Yah)
R.I.P. to Nipsey, paved the way for the Crips (For the Crips)
Plus, I'm smokin' cookie, blow Biscotti by the zip
I got it on my hip
Ayy, money on the way (Money on the way)
All I see is hundreds all day (All day)
Top chef, fish sauteed
Condo in L.A. (Ayy)
President Rollie with the date (President)
Pullin' out the foreigns, we can race (Mmm)
In and out of state (In and out of state)
Nah, we can not relate (We can not)
And, I gotta stay laced (I gotta stay laced)
She want us to date (Ah)
