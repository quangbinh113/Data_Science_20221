Song Name: Cold (feat. CADE)
(Yeah)
Yeah you know the way that we go up
6 in the morning and the shit barley over
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when you pull up
Know I'm cold, but I love when u closer
Finish up the bottle, going crazy when we post up
I been numb so I'm doubling the dose up
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when you pull up
Know I'm cold but I love when you're closer
Lost love, tend to need a little distance
If I'm honest, I don't think that we can fix it
Yeah I'm gone, I was lost to begin with
When I'm with you it's been hitting kind of different
I think it's the bottle that we sipping
You get it maybe it's the way that you dripping
You with it chemicals mix we been blurring up
The vision know we slurring words, got to love how you listen
Yeah you know the way that we go up
6 in the morning and the shit barley over
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when you pull up
Know I'm cold, but I love when u closer
Finish up the bottle, going crazy when we post up
I been numb so I'm doubling the dose up
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when u pull up
Know I'm cold but I love when you're closer
Yeah you know we're going crazy
All these girls up in my pool are getting naked
Top floor high rise up in Vegas
I won't be making any statements
With my leopard belt
She knows what she wants, she can't help herself (yeah)
Jager bombs no army
She think that she wana fall in love with me
Yeah you know the way that we go up
6 in the morning and the shit barley over
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when you pull up
Know I'm cold, but I love when u closer
Finish up the bottle, going crazy when we post up
I been numb so I'm doubling the dose up
Mind been a storm can't ignore when u pull up
Know I'm cold but I love when you're closer
Finish up the bottle, going crazy when we post up
Finish up the bottle, going crazy when we post up
I been numb so I'm doubling the dose up
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when u pull up finish up the bottle
Going crazy when we post up finish up the bottle
Going crazy when we post up I been numb so I'm doubling the dose up
Mind been a storm, can't ignore when u pull up
