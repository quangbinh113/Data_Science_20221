Song Name: PSA
(Out in the street, they call it murder)
Big DOA, nigga
Grrah, grrah, grrah-grrah, like
Grrt, grrah, grrah-grrah
Grrah, grrah-grrah
Hey, grrah-grrah
(Grrt, baow-baow)
Fuck the diss, I'ma act the fuck up
Everything dead, I ain't dappin' 'em up (everybody shot)
Feel a way, you get clapped the fuck up
Don't do Cîroc, only Ac' in my cup (grrt, baow-baow)
Try to duck, got a beam on the scope, that's tough, like
He ain't goin' nowhere, I'm shootin' wherever he run (where you goin'?) (grrt-grrt-baow)
I'm a GBG, baby, so, bitch, I'ma click 'til it's done (grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
And I love with the beam, if he run, I'ma turn him to Runtz (dummies)
Outside, no security, bitch, it's just me and my gun (it's just me and my gun) (baow, baow!)
I'm the king of New York, and I'm still outside makin' 'em run (don't run) (bitch, I do what I want)
Just copped out on a Carti' (Carti')
Oh, she jackin' my baba in a heartbeat
I like my bitch gangster, I don't like 'em Barbie
It get active like Ricky and Morty (like) (grrt-baow)
Tap your head (Rah-Rah)
Nigga Rah got clapped now he in the Marley (baow-baow!)
Nigga dead
And I'm tough by myself, no, I don't need an army (grrah)
(Out in the street, they call it murder)
Big DOA, nigga
See the line, so I'm packin' the bitch
Feel under pressure, I'm blastin' the shit
V210 how I'm whackin' the whip
He tried to up, but I'm faster with it
It get nasty, now he coughin' out blood
Told you that I get active with it (grrt, baow-baow)
Fuck the diss, I'ma act the fuck up
Everythin' dead, I ain't dappin' 'em up (everybody shot)
Feel a way, you get clapped the fuck up
Don't do Cîroc, only Ac' in my cup (grrt, baow-baow)
Try to duck, got a beam on the scope, that's tough, like
He ain't goin' nowhere, I'm shootin' wherever he run (where you goin'?) (grrt, baow)
I'm a GBG, baby, so, bitch, I'ma click 'til it's done (grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
And I love with the beam, if he run, I'ma turn him to Runtz (dummies)
Outside, no security, bitch, it's just me and my gun (it's just me and my gun) (baow, baow!)
I'm the king of New York, and I'm still outside makin' 'em run (don't run) (bitch, I do what I want)
