Catch a fed charge, now we pardoned by the laws
Niggas better stay in line or I'ma sit 'em in the morgue (come on)
Heaven on earth, half a million on a watch (watch)
Three bands on a sweater just to let a nigga watch (boss)
Nigga wanna ride the wave, so I let him hold the yacht
Cuban links for the team, double M on the lock (double M)
305 the code if you wanna get a block
You can send in Bitcoins, time to triple it with stocks (that's right)
All eyes on me, you niggas livin' in a box (huh)

While I'm really sendin' shots (biggest)
