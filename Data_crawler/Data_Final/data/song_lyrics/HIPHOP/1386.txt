Song Name: Father Time (feat. Sampha)
You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talking about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone
Reach out to Eckhart
I come from a generation of home invasions
And I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul"
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughing with my friends, they don't know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, "That boy is exhausted", he said, "Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin", I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues
Early morning wake-ups, practicing on day offs
Tough love, bottled up, no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
Early morning wake-ups, practicing on day offs
Tough love, bottled up, no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
I got daddy issues, that's on me
Looking for, "I love you," rarely empathizing for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me to not be weak
Daddy issues, hear my emotions, never express myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His mama died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon
His first reply was, "Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon"
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'nem
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healing to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific
Need assistance with the way I was brought up
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold and your tongue is made of sword
But it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensating
Learn shit 'bout being a man and disguise it as being gangsta
I love my father for telling me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues
Early morning wake-ups, practicing on day offs
Tough love, bottled up, no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
Neat no chaser, neat no chaser
