Song Name: No Fear
Even though I live my life on the road
Doesn't mean I don't have time for you
Plenty have tried, almost came close
But none of them compare to you
So let's live our life, more than one night
Promise if I could, I'd do it twice
So, what you say?
Put them on pause, press play
Hold on, I got more to say
I know my life can get so crazy
But it's gon' get cause you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
Baby let's just take our chance
Last week I was in Paris with friends
Only thing that was missing was you
Who would've thought we wouldn't be married by now
We been true loving since high school
Let's live a life, dancin' all night
You all way you should be, I want this for life
So, what you say? Put them on pause, press play
Hold on, I got more to say
I know my life can get so crazy
But it's gon' get cause you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance

Don't be shy, don't be scared, get up
I won't judge, I don't care, get up
Baby move your feet, move your hips, get up
Been waiting so long for a feeling like this, get up
I know my life can get so crazy
But it's gon' get cause your right here
Non of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I'm gonna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
Baby let's just take our chance
Baby let's just take our chance
