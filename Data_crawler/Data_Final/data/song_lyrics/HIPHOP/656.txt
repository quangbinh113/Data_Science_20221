Song Name: Man Of The Year
Cheers
Sippin' codeine like it's beer
I'm in London, so I'm screaming cheers
Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
I'm running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
They say life's a puzzle, all my pieces together
But from the way I'm movin' up
I'll prolly be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be young and decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes, she's decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck
Never have, middle fingers up, we screaming fuck 'em forever
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
