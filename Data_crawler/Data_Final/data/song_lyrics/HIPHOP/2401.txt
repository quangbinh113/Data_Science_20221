Song Name: Perfect
Oh-whoa
Beach Boy in this ho
Don't you look nice, yeah, yeah
Nails done, hair did, all-red lipstick
Don't you look nice? I'd say perfect
Yeah, I'd say perfect, yeah
Nails done, hair did, all-red lipstick
Don't you look nice? I'd say perfect
Oh God, this is it
Yeah, here she comes
She's so perfect
Don't you tell me you ain't come alone 'cause I know you did
Ain't no way you leaving on your own 'cause you never do
I would keep you here all to myself if it was up to me
But things don't always turn out how you want, yeah, unfortunately
Things change and time moves on
Things change, I know what I want
Yeah, things change, never love nothing 'til it's gone, yeah
'Cause things change, things change
Yeah, I brought you through the city
Baby girl, I was your tour guide
Words could barely tell you how it feels to be by your side, ooh
The truth, that's just the truth
Tell you how I feel that's something you could never do, yeah
She was shocked by the high life
Lost your grip when I was struck by the limelight
Told you we could be together when the time's right
But you could never see forever in your hindsight
Stuck in your hindsight
You could paint a perfect picture of the way your life's supposed to be
But I think it'd be better if you spent your time more close to me, yeah
I just wanted someone I could call mine
But I guess we would never make it past the fall time, yeah
Nails done, hair did, all-red lipstick
Don't you look nice? I'd say perfect
Yeah, I'd say perfect, yeah
Look, ails done, hair did, all-red lipstick
Don't you look nice? I'd say perfect
Oh God, this is it
Yeah, here she comes
She's so perfect
She got her new heels on as she walk through
Singing that same old song, she don't want you
Yeah, she don't want you, yeah
But don't you tell me you ain't come alone 'cause I know you did
Ain't no way you leaving on your own 'cause you never do
I would keep you here all to myself if it was up to me
But things don't always turn out how you want, yeah, unfortunately
Things change and time moves on
Things change, I know what I want, yeah
Things change, never love nothing 'til it's gone, yeah
'Cause things change, things change
Yeah, first I wanted money in my bank to say it's all mine
Then I wanted diamonds in my chain, make sure they all shine, ooh
They do, oh yeah, they do
Whoever said that money make you happy told the truth, yeah
I'm Gucci down, vacation outta town
Brand new Mercedes, yeah, I like the way it sound, wait
Don't check the price, I buy what I like, yeah
You can't be my wife but I might spoil you tonight, uh
Nails done, hair did, all-red lipstick
Don't you look nice? I'd say perfect
Oh God, this is it
Yeah, here she comes
She's so perfect
