Song Name: Finish Line
Ah
I like a lil' fine hoe, hoe
She let me run shit (what a time, what a time)
She let me (to be alive)
(She let me, ah)
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
She stick her tongue out, look back, and spell R-U-N (run)
She just wanna have fun, she's so sick and tired of love (love)
Fifty shades of red in my bed, I like drugs (drugs)
She's a sex addict fiend and she'll even fuck the plug, that's me
She know if she want it, she can get it, baby, anytime
I be racin' to that pussy, bet I hit the finish line
Big ass Draco for no rookies, bet that I'ma finish slime
My lil' bitch don't need your ten cents, nigga, 'cause she been a dime
I was in the hood the other day, that shit like Vietnam
These niggas on the other side looking in, they like some peeping Toms
You hit the bitch one time, then you in love (then you in love)
I hit the bitch one time, then I be done (then I be done)
Shawty looked me in my eyes and sucked the end of my gun (gun)
That moment forward, I knew she was the one (the one)
Bills to the ceiling, she won't pick up them ones
She my supervillain, kill them bitches for fun (fun)
Hella smoke in the air, faded dope in my lungs
Put my fangs in her neck, now she can't feel the sun
She let me
She let me
She let me
She let me (oh-oh)
She let me, me
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
She stick her tongue out, look back, and spell R-U-N
She just wanna have fun, she's so sick and tired of love (she let me)
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
Run shit (hm), run shit (hm)
She stick her tongue out, look back, and spell R-U-N
She just wanna have fun, she's so sick and tired of love
