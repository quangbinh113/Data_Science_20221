Song Name: Purple Emoji (feat. J. Cole)
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know I need you
You know I need you, baby
So much on my mind, I ain't even really sleepin' lately
I said some things I didn't mean, I know I did too much
What's love if we can't get into it, turn around and make up?
You kept it solid from beginning, baby, you my day one
You caught me in a lie, looked back up at you like I'm dumb
I had to make you my girl, you ain't afraid to speak up
No matter where we are, who it is, you still gon' tee up
Go through withdrawals when we apart, get back together, re-up
You stayed ten toes down, now you can kick your feet up
I had to boss you up, I had to level up myself
I did some growin' up, I'm doin' better for myself
But I still need you
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know, I need you, more than ever (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
More than ever
I need you, more than ever (ooh yeah, oh)
I know that I'm in trouble (ooh yeah, ooh yeah, oh)
I know I...
Uh, I got a laundry list of the sh- you done did for me
God, pulled out a rib for me
She pushed out a kid for me
When I'm gone, you hold down the crib for me
You know you wouldn't last in no prison
You told me straight up you ain't doin' no bid for me, uh
The Lord, He blessed you with common sense
Too many good b- behind the fence
For lyin' to feds for n- that climb in bed with thotties
If I ever catch me a body, I'll make you a promise, you won't know about it
I can't get you caught up in messes I made
Love you forever
When we turn like 50, I'm still gonna have all of your messages saved
Purple emojis with horns on it
Like the devil, but ain't nothin' devilish, babe
In fact, it's a Heaven-sent thing
Black angel with the regular name
F- strangers, I could never contain my passion for you
I'm grabbin' on you in public, I know that you love it
I'm tryna put one more lil' boy in your stomach
No frontin', I keep it one hunnid
If you was to leave me, I know I'm gon' plummet
I know I'm gon' plummet
I need you, more than ever
More than ever (I need you)
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know, I need you (I need you)
More than ever (more than ever)
I need you, more than ever (need you)
I know that I'm in trouble (that I'm in trouble)
I know I...
