Turn
One
I'm feelin' like EST 'cah everyone shine together (turn, turn)
'Course, the 9 can't flick like we
Big lip look like he don't have a tenner (bruck up)
I won't lie to the industry
Somebody don't love their members
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you been in the trenches, pussy
Yo, who's your opps? Can't be us (no)
Pree the block, must be bruck (no)
Pree the board, must be mud
They get it online, not back in blood (turn)
Can't be hate? Must be love (told me turn)
Can't be beef? Must be brunch (turn, told me turn)
You're involved? Can't be much (turn, turn)
Where you from? Must be cunch (turn, turn, told me)
SJ got half the 9 on a shank
Startin' to feel like a TBT (one)
So I give my young guys the four-by-four
Tell them to go to the L, not 3 (one)
They see me and wanted some clout
I rose the crime rate, ask the BBC (ask the BBC)
They had to go next block for the GBG
See a man get slapped like he just went and made a G.I. Jane joke on G-A-N-G (bap)
I jeeted out shh, and it won't get leaked
She know her secrets are safest with me (shawty)
Tell the jakes, "Free man up"
Who shot shh? Can't be Bug (bye)
All of this bine, like, get chucked
I knew soon someone will run out of luck (turn)
I'm feelin' like EST 'cah everyone shine together (turn, turn)
'Course, the 9 can't flick like we
Big lip look like he don't have a tenner (bruck up)
I won't lie to the industry
Somebody don't love their members
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you been in the trenches, pussy
Yo, who's your opps? Can't be us (no)
Pree the block, must be bruck (no)
Pree the board, must be mud
They get it online, not back in blood (turn)
Can't be hate? Must be love (told me turn)
Can't be beef? Must be brunch (turn, told me turn)
You're involved? Can't be much (turn, turn)
Where you from? Must be cunch (grr)
I can look at my block and look at the 9 (sho)
Tell me who you think's winnin' collectively
Only one man's up on their block
They can't flick like the O, I don't say that respectfully (gang)
How you get me down then run for your life?
That story sounds like a mess to me
I heard you got banned from your block
Check your friends, small boy, I don't know why you vex with me
I can put a milli' down and bet my life (uh)
He ain't got more money than Dsavv (gang)
And he done more drills than we have (whoa)
We aim straight, we don't hit knee caps (bah, oh-ah)
I ain't never been stabbed by a opp in my life, let me recap (nah)
Such lies, I can't believe that
Must be coke, they need rehab (Bando)
I'm feelin' like Kodak Black 'cause everyone snipe together (Sniper Gang)
'Course, the 9 can't chat to the O (nah)
Half of them look like they don't own a wetter (mad)
I won't lie to the industry, some-somebody won't slide for their bredrin (who?)
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you been in the trenches, pussy
Bands, you want beef? Must be dumb (boy)
Who's E? Not the 1 (trust)
Want smoke? Train your lungs
Turner turned 'round and we saw him run
It's not beef, must be lunch (must be)
Call Kreepz, bring the gun (boy)
Taste sweet, must be runtz (grrt, bye)
How you want beef and they got no funds? (Bye)
Bands, I'd hate to be from the 9 though (yo)
They ain't beat corn in years from what I know (nah)
We fling corn down back streets
Get him down high road, even turned suttin' off on the side road (boy)
Akz got it on him, so try know (my bro)
Clapz went jail, they labelled him a psycho
My friend saw him at the entrance (free him up)
Now, he's on on a pendant, lookin' all fly though (haha)
I'd rather die than scream out Edmonton (real talk)
Chest shots, I aim for the skeleton (boy)
So don't get caught lackin' on Church Street
This candle never came from a reverend (get it?)
I'm feelin' like EST 'cah everyone shine together (Turn, turn)
'Course, the 9 can't flick like we
Big lip look like he don't have a tenner (Bruck up)
I won't lie to the industry
Somebody don't love their members
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you been in the trenches, pussy
Yo, who's your opps? Can't be us (no)
Pree the block, must be bruck (no)
Pree the board, must be mud
They get it online, not back in blood (turn)
Can't be hate? Must be love (told me turn)
Can't be beef? Must be brunch (turn, told me turn)
You're involved? Can't be much (turn, turn)
Where you from? Must be cunch (turn, told me turn up, cunch)
