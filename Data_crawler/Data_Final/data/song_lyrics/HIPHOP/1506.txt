Don't come outside, we send them killers at your door (door), huh, yeah (yeah)
Talk down on the gang, lil' bitch, we slice your throat (slice), huh, yeah
Brand new Wraith, it got the cloth, look like a ghost (cloth), huh, yeah (woo)
On the yacht, let's have a toast 'cause I'm the G.O.A.T. (yeah), huh, yeah (yeah)
I just spent like 30 thousand on some clothes (clothes), yeah (ayy, thirty)
And just made a hundred thousand for a show (show), yeah (yeah, hey)

Leave his body red like Kool-Aid Man, like, oh (oh), yeah (yeah)
Stackin' and flippin' that money, not sellin' my soul (stackin' that)
Walk in that room, told that bitch not to slip on my drip 'cause it's all on the floor (don't slip)
Trap all this shit in the Nawf, in the 'bando they knock at the door like Jehovah (knock, knock)
I keep a hundred round drum in the back of my trunk and it bite like a Cobra (grrah, grrah, grrah)
Feelin' like Tony Montana, the world is mine we runnin' the globe (mine)
Get the fuck up, I don't know (go)
30-round Glock for the internet trolls (bah)
Fuck on a thot, I'ma pay for the bros (yes, sir)
Count up a M in one night in my Rolls (count up)
Put this shit on me or put me in Vogue
Straight out the Nawf, Big 34 (Nawf)
