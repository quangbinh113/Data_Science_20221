I rock water, diamonds, I'm drippin' but not slippin'
I threw a quarter, (well damn) but no I'm not trippin'
Bugatti on Forgi's, and nawl, I'm not crippin'

Chillin', just me and my millions
Niggas, they all in they feelin's
My bitches, I spoil them like they children
So persistent, if I want it, I go get it
I'm so slimy, grimy, sheisty but still shining
Rude and unkindly, cruel with no conscious

Two cups of purple just to warm up
(Two cups, drank)
I heard your bitch she got that water
