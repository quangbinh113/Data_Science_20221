Song Name: saddest soundtrack
I'ma take your smile, and turn it upside down
I'ma take the sun, and cover it in clouds
I still hear your voice, in my head it's loud
I'll turn up this song, just to drown you out
Drown these memories, 'til the bottle's empty
'Cause the feeling's ugly
Hope you hear me now
Falling in and out of love
Turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up
No backup plan for us, now I know it wasn't love
So I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Often, I feel like a ghost 'cause you're haunted
Every single place that I walk in, I proceed with caution
Block you out, but I still hear you talkin'
I know, when you hear this song you'll be calling
Drown these memories 'til the bottle's empty
'Cause the feeling's ugly
Hope you hear me now
Falling in and out of love
Turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up
No backup plan for us, now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Falling in and out of love
Turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up
No backup plan for us, now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
