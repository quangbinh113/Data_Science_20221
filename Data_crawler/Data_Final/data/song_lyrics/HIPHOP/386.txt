Song Name: Somebody
Internet Money, bitch
We love you, Tecca
Why you jackin' static, jackin' static 'til we roll up
I got all these bitches lovin' me like I am Sosa
Stop talkin' with your chest, lil' bitty bitch, you better bold up
Told her, "Hit my jack," and when she hit me, told her, "Hold up"
I just want somebody, 'body
To treat me like somebody, 'body
And not like anybody, 'body
All you gotta do is love me for me, girl
I just want somebody, 'body
To treat me like somebody, 'body
And not like anybody, 'body
All you gotta do is love me for me, girl
I just want somebody, body
To treat me like somebody, body
You wanna talk? You better call me, call me
Don't gotta wait, don't gotta stall me, stall me
You know I'm on my phone, I pick it up when it ring
You know I hit you back, 'cause you is my everything
You know you'd be my queen if you let me be your king
You know you wanna jam, so I got you with anything, yeah
Why you jackin' static, jackin' static 'til we roll up
I got all these bitches lovin' me like I am Sosa
Stop talkin' with your chest, lil' bitty bitch, you better bold up
Told her, "Hit my jack," and when she hit me, told her, "Hold up"
I just want somebody, 'body

I'm sick of actin' like everything's okay when it's not good
Nowadays everybody wanna be top one

In the two-seater, my shawty playin' shotgun
But I need somebody, 'body, yeah

But don't you call me my nickname, don't call me Artie, yeah

Stop talkin' with your chest, lil' bitty bitch, you better bold up
Told her, "Hit my jack," and when she hit me, told her, "Hold up"
I just want somebody, 'body
To treat me like somebody, 'body
And not like anybody, 'body
All you gotta do is love me for me, girl
