Yeah, yeah
Ain't heard a sound from the opps, they been put up
Better have them bitches out when they pull up
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby

Yeah, yeah (mhm-mhm)
Go (mhm-mhm)
Yeah, yeah
Levels (yeah, yeah)
Rich-ass steppers (yeah)
She never been hit by a stepper (uh)
Fuck me with my glick on the dresser (uh-huh)
She wanna see what's up with my pimpin' (get me)
Wonder why a nigga so aggressive (wonder why, let's go)
Show you how to deal with a stepper (yeah)
Need me somethin' real and some affection
Said I'd always be bae, didn't it? (Mm-mm)
Said I'm tryna fuck on you right now
Say that pussy was mine, bae, don't play with it
Pull that thang out, put that in your mouth
I ain't got that much time, no, I stay busy
I got shit on my mind and I can't get it
Off until you come ride on this thing with it
Up and down, side to side, girl, don't play with it, slidin' all day in it
Love me a bitch got the twirl in the hips like a dancer (yeah)
Made me fuck her on camera (go)
She know I won't leak it, she been my lil' secret
She trust me like family (yeah)
That's the type of thug love that we havin'
Treat her just like a slut when we smashin'
Put my thumb in the butt, make it nasty (ooh)
Levels (yeah, yeah)
Rich-ass steppers (yeah)
She never been hit by a stepper (go)
Fuck me with my glick on the dresser (uh-huh)
She wanna see what's up with my pimpin' (get me)
Wonder why a nigga so aggressive (wonder why) (let's go)
Show you how to deal with a stepper (yeah)
Need me somethin' real and some affection
They come in here, they eatin' french fries
Usually I never sympathize
Baby, you got you a gangster this time
I'm winnin', it cost me a mansion to rhyme
Steppin' on niggas and standin' on bitches
She lovin' my pimpin', she notice we different
She want me, I'm fresh out of prison
She like her a nigga who killin'
She hear how they comin' up missin'
I'm gangster, but I'm on my business
Big boy drippin', Dior not in stores, ayy
She never rolled in a Porsche, yeah
I know your life was bored
'Cause you never had you a Snipe' before
Rich-ass shooter got big-ass jewelers
Ain't doin' no losin', she see me, she droolin'
Levels (yeah, yeah)
Rich-ass steppers (yeah)
She never been hit by a stepper (go)
Fuck me with my glick on the dresser (uh-huh)
She wanna see what's up with my pimpin' (get me)
Wonder why a nigga so aggressive (wonder why) (let's go)
Show you how to deal with a stepper (yeah)
Need me somethin' real and some affection
