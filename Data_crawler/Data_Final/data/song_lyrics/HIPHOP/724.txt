Song Name: ChopBloc Pt. 3 (feat. NLE Choppa) - Pt. 3
Ayy, Cartoon, you got another oneIceberg want a bag, bitch
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, we put the Drac' up to yo' face
I seen Lil Tevo knock him out
I bet we put him in his place
Twenty Grapes up in this house and we all posted with K's
Let him play, I air him out, I just walk 'em down in my J's
I'm still posted with cuttas
I shoot at mammas and brothas
We ain't worried 'bout the others
We see them niggas, they suffer
We bagged 'em up in the duffel
We dab 'em up then we bust 'em
I brought my flip flops in fights
'Cause I'm shootin' I'm never scufflin'
When the murda come and meet you and yo' door
Yeah, it's me, bitch
AR-15 and it got a scope, with my ski, bitch
Big Grape on a vine, big Loc we spit that G shit
Take yo' diss song, get you killed, then make a remix
Do you wanna slide tonight?
If he don't he gonna die tonight
Thousand dollar Glock, exotic pipe, you know we grip it tight
If the prices right, catch him on sight, walk up and take his life
Told the opps to white the chalk up, that his body laid that night
Campin' out in bushes and ditches, that's if I wanna miss him
By myself, I made the decision, don't want no codefendant
Catch a witness, catch a face shot, don't need no reminiscin'
Bare face, and I'm face to face
Catch a case then I'm not guilty
Yeah, I'm not guilty
I get rich or die tryin', I'm not 50
I just fucked the plug bitch now his watch missin'
Time is money nigga we finessed the clock with it
I got shootas at the line, call 'em Mike Bibby
He playin' games, we spin around, do a 360
That's a Xbox, you wear G-Shock
Draco ride shotgun got the seat hot
Miami, I got heat, bitch, I'm Chris Bosh
223, hit his feet, make him hopscotch
You just served two niggas that looked like Drake and Josh
No wonder why the police on yo' block hot
You got shot? Let me shoot you in the same spot
I got money, but I'm still on that same block
Caught a body and I still got the same Glock
Go dig it up, I bet it's still in the same spot
Yeah, and I'm still in the same spot
Yeah, and I ride for my niggas
And I ride for my niggas
And I die for my niggas
We like fuck them other niggas
Ayy, ayy, we put the Drac' up to yo' face
I seen Lil Tevo knock him out
I bet we put him in his place
Twenty Grapes up in this house and we all posted with K's
Let him play, I air him out, I just walk 'em down in my J's
I'm still posted with cuttas
I shoot at mammas and brothas
We ain't worried 'bout the others
We see them niggas, they suffer
We bagged 'em up in the duffel
We dab 'em up then we bust 'em
I brought my flip flops in fights
'Cause I'm shootin' I'm never scufflin'
