Song Name: Jerry Curl (feat. Larry June)
Ayy, look
Joke's on you, brother, look at me now, ayy
Joke's on you, brother, we made it out, ayy
I been through Hell and hot water in that exact order
But the joke's on you, bitch, I found a way to smile, yeah, uh
Greatness in your presence, nigga, take a bow
I'm highly regarded, know it's hella shit I won't allow
I don't ask for much, I just ask for niggas to hold me down
I figured out how to get what I want, I'm the only child
Ayy, joke's on you, brother, she love the steez, uh
Joke's on you, brother, we overseas, uh
Joke's on you 'cause when you thought you was gettin' them jokes off
I was puttin' in hella work that no one seen
Now the whip don't pick me up unless that bitch a sleeve
I came to shake a couple hands, show face, and leave
Make room for all of them blessings that I'm gon' receive
Then we woke up in Santorini, Greece off the bean
Nigga, this a dream, oh, yeah
Brushing my teeth, look in the mirror, see that man
My whip foreign and my jeans from Japan
How are you mad at me? I stuck to the plan
How are you mad at me? Took it everywhere they told me I can't
Took it everywhere, I'm—
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Niggas doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Bouncin' out looking like Jordan at his prime
'87 'Vette with the seat on recline
You can slide through, but gotta leave around nine
Calculated moves got a nigga living fine
An Earl Grey tea on a Sunday morning drive
I came from that life, but I keep it so suave
Still move in silence, still spreadin' knowledge
Still got love for my niggas that been riding
Jottin' down my plans, after that, I took a quick ride
Got a lil' bored after that, so I switched rides
Quick business move, now I'm on the golf course with Sean
Lil' game for you niggas, always adjust with time
Pretty girl, nice smile, got a nigga like, "Wow"
Got a nigga saying anything, like, "Let's settle down"
I was in the game, but I'm ready now (Ready now)
Niggas pocket watchin', I just ran a couple miles
I ain't worried 'bout you niggas, man, never
Brushing my teeth, look in the mirror, see that man
My whip foreign and my jeans from Japan
How are you mad at me? I stuck to the plan
How are you mad at me? Took it everywhere they told me I can't
Took it everywhere, I'm—
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Niggas doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Niggas doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Niggas doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Doing Jheri curls 'round the world, mmm
Niggas doing Jheri curls 'round the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
