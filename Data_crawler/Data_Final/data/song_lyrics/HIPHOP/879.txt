Song Name: i n t e r l u d e
I'm a living little good thing (yeah)
It's like you never lived for me, yeah
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good, yeah

Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sitting on top of this shit

This shit can go one or two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down

Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah
I be coming in peace, but fuck me
Best beware the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen yo' mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't want bury your brother
The blood leaks while the EMTs gotta carry her baby like surrogate mothers
Whoa, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothing
Through hard times, it was there I discovered
A hustle and making the best out the struggle
I kept grinding 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9s like to air out rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowing what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
Then summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold the double disc
Block hot, niggas burning up the street
Shots popping and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas running up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Was his niggas getting murdered e'ry week?
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' homie got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60s
Christ went to Heaven age 33
And so did Pimp C, and so did Nipsey
I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen the lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah
