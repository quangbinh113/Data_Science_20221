Song Name: Sanguine Paradise
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song
Yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you can buy ho
But I bought a mansion
With a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear it hit the high note
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they tens, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise
I got different color on my diamonds
I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face
I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith
I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine
Tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin'
There's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin'
They the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin'
Yeah, my doors suicide
Side note, you will never reach my goals
I be walkin' with a slimed nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon
So I feel like Michael
I was talking to my lil' slime
That's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality I'm 5'4
Stand on my money now I'm 6'6
Hit her once now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister make her lick dick
.40 on me make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aiming at his top, boy you need a mop
Man I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce
So she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes I am a dog
I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage
I got different color on my diamonds
I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face
I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith
I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k
It was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine
Tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin'
There's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin'
They the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin',
Yeah, my doors suicide
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana
This beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds
I'm getting the cake now
I stay on your stomach lil' bitch
When you lay down
Live it up, cause
You can go any day now
Mykko Montana
This beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds
'Cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach lil' bitch better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out
My whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds
You know I got rented
Know my boys coming and
You know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for
Already spent it
When I'm on the beat man
You know I'm gon' kill it
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song
Yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro
I got different color on my diamonds
I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face
I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith
I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k
It was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine
Tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin'
There's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin'
They the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin'
Yeah, my doors suicide
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
