Song Name: Super Freaky Girl - Roman Remix
She's alright
That girl's alright with me (mmm), yeah
This is the extended version
Ayy-yo (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slipping and sliding
I can do all them little tricks, and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-E, A-K
F-R-E, A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
E-A-K, F-R-E-A-K
Uh, okay, one thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications, I write "pressure" 'cause that's what I apply (brrr)
Pressure, applied, can't fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas, and stickier than apple pie, brrr!
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slipping and sliding
I can do all them little tricks, and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-E, A-K
F-R-E, A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
E-A-K, F-R-E-A-K
'Cause what the fuck? This ain't Chanel? Nigga, custom down?
Like, what the fuck? This ain't Burberry? Custom brown?
He said, "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"
Then he said, "Do that pussy purr?" I said, "Yup, meow"
Hold up, fuckboys, ain't no need for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap, neither scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh-whoa, elegant bitch with a hoe glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe
Fuck is the tea? I just F'd a G
Made him say "Uh", just ask Master P
Ball so hard, I just took a knee
Get me Rocky A$AP, nigga, word to Rih'
Freak, freak
Some gyal a freak, gyal a freak
Gyal a freak, freak, freak, freak
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slipping and sliding
I can do all them little tricks, and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-E, A-K
F-R-E, A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
E-A-K, F-R-E-A-K
F-R-E-A-K
I'm a movie, I should be on replay
I'm tryna F-U-C-K
He got pictures of my titties in his briefcase
I like D-I-C-K
I like bad bitches too, she could be bae
Ass fat to the max like TJ
BJ, while he speeding on the freeway
Don't play with Nicki 'cause it could get tricky
And that's word to Dricki, bitch, it could get sticky
And that's word to Dwayne Michael Carter
I'ma finish these dumb bitches, Michael Myers
Don't nobody wanna hear that weak shit, hoe
In the game, 15, ain't peak yet, hoe
Tell that goofy, "Get a chair", she was cocky, I could swear
'Til my old tape sold more than your album
Drop a tear (Nick James, bitch)
Drop a tear (I'm Nick James, bitch)
Drop a tear (I'm Nick James), drop a tear (I'm Nick James)
Drop a motherfucking tear (bitch, bitch, bitch...)
I can lick it, I can ride it while you slipping and sliding
I can do all them little tricks, and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-E, A-K
F-R-E, A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
E-A-K, F-R-E-A-K
