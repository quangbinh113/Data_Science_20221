Song Name: Feelinâ€™ Sexy
A-Ass so fat need a lap dance
Make a nigga eat it up like Pac-Man
I don't want him if the trap ain't trapping
Wouldn't be me if the mack ain't macking
Ay
Bitches couldn't see me from the clouds
These bitches talk I can't hear em from the clout
Why is you here how you hating from the couch
Trackstar I'll run in bitches mouth
Ay
4 shots in feeling sexy
All my niggas gone call gone text me
I love it when they Say My Name like destiny
I just give a little gotta pay to get the rest of me
And I'm
Finna blow kamikaze
Ay
Pussy do him like wockiii
Ay
It got the ass on fat fat
Make his baby mama wanna block me
Bitch just jealous
Hoe can't match my style no necklace
Bitches ain't haters they just wanna take selfies
Shade room comments full of wanna be besties
Couple niggas tryna get the V like eddies
Wish a bitch would don't try
Can't check me hating on me now you was hating already
I don't fuck with hoes these
Hoes too messy how I got a nigga eating ass just met me
Cuz I'm nasty
Get a lot of head these niggas can't pass me
Had yo nigga eating pussy just last week
If you want the nigga back just ask me
Bitch be happy I got receipts that can ruin yo family
I ain't finna argue with a bitch in her Camry
Ay he is not mine not yours
Let's share em
And I fuck with bitches I can help with yo appearance
Yea I'm like that
These bitches suck y'all bitches
Like to hype that everything I drop
Try to do it just just like that
Damn I ain't even copyright that
(I ain't even copyright that)
Mic check
Hoes acting weird thats why I don't play nice back
Ay
I been living life cuz you don't ever get a night back
You hoes aint writing y'all shit and I don't like det
(I don't like it)
