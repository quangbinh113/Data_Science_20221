Rolls-Royce truck, that's tough (That's hard)
You see the star when you look up (Look up)
Bad bitch and she got put up (Bad)
Huncho in the back, cookin' up (Cookin' up)
That's tough (Tough), that's tough (Damn)
That's tough (Ten), that's tough (Woo)
That's tough (That's tough), that's tough (Go)
That's tough (Go), that's tough (Uh)
Baguettes and the emeralds, they shinin' together, that's tough (Baguettes, yeah, su')

Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some with you, that's tough (Gettin' some with you, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some with you, that's tough (Gettin' some with you, that's tough)
We tough (Tough), you soft (Soft)
Make a phone call and knock 'em off (Brr)
That's a 150 at the loft (Hunnid)
I can make a play like Randy Moss (What?)
Ride the Rolls-Royce like a boss (Skrrt)
It's a bando, not a house
I can stack the money in the couch (Money)
I just get the check and then I'm out (What?)
We came up from nothing to something, got millis, we up (We up)
Pull off in the lamb then race the Bentley, that's us (Us, skrrt)
That's tough, rich boss (Boss)
Don't talk on my pocket, they stuffed (They stuffed)
You ain't got the money, you bluff (You bluff)
My bitch badder than Rihanna, that's tough (That's tough)
Rolls-Royce truck, that's tough (That's hard)
You see the star when you look up (Look up)
Bad bitch and she got put up (Bad)
Huncho in the back, cookin' up (Cookin' up)
Don't fuck with it, that's your loss (Your loss)
Big Backwood, blow the face off (Gas)
Money, make racks on the day off (Racks)
Money, make racks on the day off
Uh, who want the beef? (Who?)
I patty a bitch, I patty a bitch (Beef patty)
Straight out the street (Street)
Hey, pass me the stick, pass me the stick (Rrah)
I stand on two feet (Two)
I raise my wrist, I prayed you a brick (Brick)
It's Huncho and Rich (Rich)
Not Lilo & Stitch, we came to hit licks
That's tough, that's tough (That's hard)
That's tough, that's tough (Look up)
That's tough, that's tough (Bad)
That's tough, that's tough (Cookin' up)
That's tough (Tough), that's tough (Damn)

That's tough (That's tough), that's tough (Go)
That's tough (Go), that's tough (Uh)
Baguettes and the emeralds, they shinin' together, that's tough (Baguettes, yeah, su')
Ten years later, they still in the picture, that's tough (Woo, that's tough, su')
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some with you, that's tough (Gettin' some with you, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some with you, that's tough (Gettin' some with you, that's tough)
