Song Name: Sorry 4 What? // LV BELT
I'm not tryna be here for a long time
Just, just a good, good time
I got a lot of shit weighin' on my mind
Weighin' on my mind
So fuckin' serious, you niggas delirious
Said it with exclamation, but niggas can't fuck with me, period
Bitch, right off the bat, I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeros look good on my checks
I got like two or three phones for business and bitches
And still can't even answer a text
Yeah, we in the spot, we gon' give it a rest
They be sayin' that that liquor gon' catch up to you
Nigga, it ain't caught up to me yet
I hit the road, I look like the mayor
Countin' up 50's and 20's and tens
I'm out of state, they give me a ten
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
That was the plan again, bitch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis, it look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spend, I spend, yeah
I done fucked with her, she fiesty
All of the niggas that's with me are shiesty
This is the reason these niggas don't like me, yeah
I gotta win, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricy
I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna fuck with a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B
I'm on the road, like the motherfuckin' dice be
I'm catchin' pussy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' pussy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?
I, I've had way too much to drink, you know, I
1942, it ain't on me, sing to five
Ex callin' up my phone, fuckin' up the vibe
Tonight's not the night, tonight's not the-
Yeah, fuck that bitch, yeah
Hop on the couch, yeah (yeah), take me a flick, yeah (uh)
The Louis V belt, yeah (yeah), Louis V belt, yeah (uh)
Fuck that bitch, yeah (yeah)
Hop on the couch, yeah (yeah), take me a flick, yeah
Louis V belt, yeah (yeah), Louis V belt, yeah
Louis V belt, yeah (yeah), Louis V belt, yeah, Louis V belt, yeah
