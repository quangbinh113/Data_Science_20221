Song Name: Magic
Yeah
Roll one up and hit this magic
Oh, yeah (Roll one up and hit this magic)
Yeah
Roll one up and hit this magic (Yeah)
With the gang, we ball out, it can get tragic (Let's go)
All we got, we gon' let you niggas have it (Woo woo)
Stuck in my ways, think I need to change my habits (Woo woo)
What would you do if you were me and didn't have shit? (Yeah)
Look in the mirror, now I'm feeling like a savage (Let's go)
Tell my son I love him, for him, I'ma make it happen (Woo woo)
Now my dreams reality, not going back to trapping (Woo woo)
You say that you proud of me, I turn my back, you laughing
Now I hit the scene, they like lights, camera, action
Living in a dream, now my music they be blasting (Yeah)
Step out, I'm a star, always in the latest fashion
Had to set the bar, niggas try to catch me lacking
Bank account for my son, he won't have to struggle
You can see it in my eyes, all I do is hustle
They tried to knock me off my feet, I'm ready to rumble
Feel like I ain't ate in weeks, working off the muscle
Oh yeah, oh my, we ride, for my brothers no lie
All you niggas can die, never wrong, they right
I ain't changing my side, yeah, we in it for life
If you down, we ride
Roll one up and hit this magic (Yeah)
With the gang, we ball out, it can get tragic (Let's go)
All we got, we gon' let you niggas have it (Woo woo)
Stuck in my ways, think I need to change my habits (Woo woo)
What would you do if you were me and didn't have shit? (Yeah)
Look in the mirror, now I'm feeling like a savage (Let's go)
Tell my son I love him, for him, I'ma make it happen (Woo woo)
Now my dreams reality, not going back to trapping (Woo woo)
You say that you proud of me, I turn my back, you laughing
Ayy, how could you lie to my face?
People claim that they be loyal, they be taking up space
See my broski lose his heart when he was fighting that case
Took so many L's, I'm not going back to those days
I'ma treat you how you treat me, do you like how it tastes?
Shawty, you's a one nighter, can't treat you like my Ace
I got way too many problems to be worried, I'm straight
Me and Craig selling weed, had to watch for the jakes
On the road, this shit crazy, I get eighty a show
Save my money, stack it up, it look like I'm selling dope
Foreign cars, driving fast, I've never done this before
Get high, drown out my problems, let me pour me a fo' (Yeah)
Roll one up and hit this magic (Yeah)
With the gang, we ball out, it can get tragic (Let's go)
All we got, we gon' let you niggas have it (Woo woo)
Stuck in my ways, think I need to change my habits (Woo woo)
What would you do if you were me and didn't have shit? (Yeah)
Look in the mirror, now I'm feeling like a savage (Let's go)
Tell my son I love him, for him, I'ma make it happen (Woo woo)
Now my dreams reality, not going back to trapping (Woo woo)
You say that you proud of me, I turn my back, you laughing
