Song Name: One Take
Lil Tjay
I got a plan to run up some bands
You tell me can't, I tell you, "I am"
Free all my brothers that's stuck in the can
Glizzy on me, .38 on jam
I pack, I can make you a strand
Free Mark, he went down off the Xan
Fake jeans, that shit come from Japan
I be flexing, you can look at my 'Gram
Bitches see me and they know who I am
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm a fan
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm the man
I remember I was whippin' the pan
Wasn't right, but I did what I can
Fuck it doe, 'cause I'm just livin' my life
Remember times when the day wasn't bright
Half a pint up in a two-liter Sprite
I'ma make sure all my niggas a'ight
Commissary and I'm shippin' out kites
Takin' off, 'bout to book me a flight
Diamonds dancin' in the middle of night
Fire bitches started bein' polite
I remember when I watchin' their tape
Now they figure I can better they life
I ain't listenin' to niggas advice
Unless I feel what you tellin' me right
Fuck tomorrow, I'ma ball for tonight
I got potential to ball like I'm Mike
VVS diamonds, no regular ice
Heard a mistake when they see me on sight
Bitch, all that talkin' endanger your life
I keep a strap, Lil Tjay a dyke
Brought on my head like I dealt with the price
Nigga, runnin' your mouth
I have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out
Bitch, you could mob, and no tongin' me down
Make fun of me now, they see me like, "Wow"
Niggas that hate and go wantin' me down, runnin' your mouth
I have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out, ayy
It's not about holdin' my pants up
This money gon' call, I'm gon' answer
I used to be down, but look at me now
I just fucked some bitch named Amanda
And bitches be blingin' my hotline
Drop top at the stop sign
You say that you flexin', boy, stop lyin'
And your bitch a eater, she not mine
And I'm goin' straight to the top, watch how I open up shop
Fuck out my way, I don't need you while we great
Gettin' to it out of state
I need a bag, that's the reason why I splash every time I'm on the track
Foot on the gas, leave them niggas in the past, I remember I was trash
Down to my last, I ain't never even ask, now I look at y'all and laugh
Niggas be mad, why don't you look at my dad?
It's crazy this happened so fast
I'm on the road and I'm bringin' my bros
I'ma do it for all of the guys on the ave'
Pop me a flag, pop me a tag, sippin' dirty, I don't know how to act
They said I'm the new A Boogie, relax
I ain't never try to copy your swag
I'm just tryna put my hood on the map
Ellie use to live right next to the trap
Love or hate me, I'ma get to the racks
Skippin' niggas and they pullin' ya back
I was sleepin', yeah I was takin' a nap, ohh, nah
Nah, runnin' your mouth
I have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out
Bitch, you could mob, and no tongin' me down
Make fun of me now, they see me like, "Wow"
Niggas that hate and go wantin' me down, runnin' your mouth
I have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out, ayy
'Fore the sun even out
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out
Yo, yo, yo
Lil Tjay
