Song Name: Super Gremlin
Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (hey bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stake for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob)
But way more error (ATL Jacob)
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you?
I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin'
Rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business
And spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin'
You ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' a lot of cappin'
Watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of the witness
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Trackhawk with the kit
Snatch off on the bitch when I slide
Nightlight on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake
But I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get out
All you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent
No half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin
AK, 20-inch carbon
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Trackhawk with the kit
Snatch off on the bitch when I slide
Nightlight on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake
But I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (now your time is up)
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial, but way more error
I ain't slimin', I'm grimin'
Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust
Nightmare, baby, you know I-
I bet you always see me in your dreams
Glee
