Ayy
I ain't gotta ask, I know my momma proud of me
And my nigga we was thuggin', we was doin' robberies
You ain't gotta ask if it's on me, it's on the side
Everytime that a young nigga ride
Hundred shots up out this choppa, let them glide
I can't let him slide, 'cause they fuck with my pride
I'm in the club with glizzy and my blicky
Tryin' not hurt somebody, ayy
'Cause I was stuck up in the storm when rain came
We don't care where it's at and we do it broad day
I let the opps run the city, tryna maintain
Goin' down the wrong road gave me road rage
I had to tell 'em we ain't goin' for nothin'
Don't know what the squad on
But rich nigga like like the lotto, sippin' Muscato
I put a nigga on the news, I probably read about him
Her head super-duper fire, make her head throttle
He say "Tell me the meanin' of a thug
I rather be a gangsta, 'cause I can't show no love"
'Fore I do my dirt, I mask it on with a glove
If he get up in my way, then I'ma hit him with the slug
I ain't gotta ask, I know my momma proud of me
And my nigga we was thuggin', we was doin' robberies
You ain't gotta ask if it's on me, it's on the side
Everytime that a young nigga ride
Hundred shots up out this choppa, let them glide
I can't let him slide, 'cause they fuck with my pride
I'm in the club with glizzy and my blicky
Tryin' not hurt somebody (nah, nah, nah)
Ayy, got my glizzy and my blicky, tryin' not hurt somebody
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Bum, bum, NLE the top shotta, yeah
Got them bombs like Al-Qaeda
