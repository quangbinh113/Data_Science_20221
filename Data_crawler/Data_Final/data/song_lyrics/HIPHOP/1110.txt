Song Name: Flocky Flocky (feat. Travis Scott)
Two cups
Tastin' cotton candy, hit the gas, oh (Two cups)
I'm doin' a hunnid, I ain't see the dash, oh
I count my blessings, know I'm movin' fast
I pull up there with M's (skrrt), I'm back on whenever
Caught that flight in the morning, a flight to New Orleans (yeah)
I'll be back in the morning
I'll be back in the morning
She steady tweakin' off whatever you call it (tweak, tweak)
She flocky, flocky on whatever you call it (yeah)
Lil' shawty slip, but I won't leave 'til the morning
Se√±orita got me goin' and goin' (yeah)
You got a lot of questions, I got hella answers
When you're movin' in silence, had me movin' careful
Had me movin' too carefully, you wasn't there for me (girl)
You can look, but don't stare at me

Yeah
Tastin' cotton candy, hit the gas, oh
I'm doin' a hunnid, I ain't see the dash, oh
I count my blessings, know I'm movin' fast
Yeah (woo)
Blessings on blessings
I'm drownin' all in 'em, I'm havin' a scoop (yeah)
Top of the top, and I'm leadin' that chart 'cause
I'm still off the boo, uh (let's go)
Yeah, you walk away and shake, them macarenas (cha-cha)
I took her far away, to Lithuania (it's lit)
I keep a place to bait, to tune your brain up (uh)
She stuff her face in cake, no way it's- (safe)
Just save your words, that's safe
Glocks and handles (alright)
Glocks and cougars
Got guns, now you tucked
Lockin' that juicer (woo)
Lawyers and shooters (woo, woo)
Are they gon' prove stuff? Right from my tool, yeah (sh-sh)
It's in my hanister (yeah), I ain't a rooster
I fucked and hit the dust, I'm changin' routes, yeah (straight up)
She left in my tracksuit and my 1's, I gave her new bucks
Bought a pint with the EDD, I swear you doin' too much
Tastin' cotton candy, hit the gas, oh
I'm doin' a hunnid, I ain't see the dash, oh
I count my blessings, know I'm movin' fast
I pull up there with M's (skrrt), I'm back on whenever
Caught that flight in the morning, a flight to New Orleans (yeah)
I'll be back in the morning (yeah-yeah)
I'll be back in the morning (back in the morning)
She steady tweakin' off whatever you call it (tweak, tweak)
She flocky flocky on whatever you call it (yeah)
Lil' shawty slip, but I won't leave 'til the morning
