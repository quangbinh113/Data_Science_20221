Song Name: HAD ENOUGH (feat. Quavo & Offset)
I know
I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me (Ooh)
But stay a while (Ooh)
I know you had enough of me, of me
Get on down if you're bad enough
You and all your friends hopped out that Bentley truck
You doin' your thing, baby, live it up
You showin' out and you don't give a fuck (Yeah)
It's a rodeo, go on and touch your toes
I'ma hit you from the back and that's as far as it goes (Oh)
I done knocked 'em all down like some dominoes
She get money off that pussy and she climb the pole (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got two choices, either heaven or hell (You got two choices)
Meanwhile, put that dope on the scale (Brick or a bale), yeah
Meanwhile, bitch, I'm watching for 12 (Uh-huh)
Prayin' to my God I ain't goin' to jail
I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me (Ooh)
But stay a while (Ooh)
I know you had enough (Oh, oh) of me
Hey
Know you had enough (What?)
Lookin' like what the fuck (Who?)
You can't trust, you think I'm in love with lust (Ooh)
She look possessed, go and get it off your chest (Hey)
She asked to read my texts (Texts)
Lookin' in her eyes, she stressed
Shawty get wet like baguettes
Take off your gown and your dress (Take it off)
She got C-cup, D-cup breast (D-cup)
She a bird and she leavin' the nest (Brr)
I'ma swerve and get off at the exit (Swerve)
The rock on her finger dyslexic (Stupid)
Get the money, I gotta protect it (Protect it)
Brought my hand, but I never regret shit
All these bitches lyin', wanna sex me (Lie, oh)
Eat it up, tryna catch me (Eat it up)
They want the dressing and the recipe (Recipe)
I want the buns like the sesame (Sesame, yeah)
And I can really tell that she love me (Yup)
Overload on Chanel and make her weep
Know you had enough of the side piece (Side)
Know you had enough, we drink like Vikings (Purple)
Spike Lee, do the right thing
But she can't get enough of the piping (Pipe)
Had enough
Of me (Ooh)
Stay a while (Ooh)
I know you had enough of me
