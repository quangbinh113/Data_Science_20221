Song Name: Swanginâ€™ On Westheimer
Don't put me in a box now
I'm by myself, yeah, I'm on lockdown
Sometimes you gotta find
What's wrong, yeah, what's right
It's been a long road here coming
Blue hunnids I'm thumbing
And I can split the whole damn thing with my woman
What's yours is mine
I'll say it again what's yours is mine
Don't leave the house, baby
You gotta swing my way
But don't believe the hype, babe
I'm always shady
So, don't believe the hype, babe
I might last sometimes
Don't believe the hype, babe
We're going 'til five in the morning
I caught you yawning, ah yeah
I guess it can't get no easy
I know you need me
I guess it gon' ride your way
If I do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy
I know you need me
Round two, three shots, I'm catching up
She off the Henny and tequila, no catching her
The way she move her body, man I swear I'm attached to her
Don't make me sing this here song
And I mean, I made it out on my own
You call me, "Hater" when you're all alone
Oo-oo, yeah, yeah
Oo-oo, yeah, yeah
Oo-oo
We're going 'til five in the morning
I caught you yawning, ah, yeah
I guess it can't get no easy
I know you need me
I guess it gon' ride your way
'Fore I do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy
I know you need me
I gotta live my life
But I swear I'm seeing too much
And I'm thinking 'bout where I am
And I know just how I was
I just had to take you back to the AC
Kicking it there, ballin'
You done learned some language on me
I wanna go falling
You've been posted at the post off-
And I got evidence
Pulled up my car, left my residence
At the gaslight, lemme smell this shit
At the red light inhaling it
If the cops behind, ain't telling it
And the way that I pull up late
I might as well sell this shit
No out weighing my love, ain't no scaling it
She wanna take a dose
Go inhale that shit
She wanna take a dose
Go inhale that shit
We're going 'til five in the morning
I caught you yawning, ah yeah
I guess it can't get no easy
I know you need me, yeah
I guess it gon' ride your way
If I do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy
I know you need me, yeah
Know I'm here for a good time
I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I just wanna ride around town
You're here for a good time
I just wanna get you down and out in the wild
I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I just wanna ride around town
