Cause shawty got me pissed (Cause shawty got me pissed)
Better fall back
For I give that bitch a lisp (Boom boom boom)
Money on my house
Give a fuck about my wrist
Said you can't be touched (Oh yeah)

I know that I'm rich
But that's my project bitch
Loyalty mean somethin'
To my bitch she won't switch

Need a brand new weave
Killed my dog

Ride that dick to beat

Glockie like a baby
Carry that on my hip

Cause shawty got me pissed (Cause shawty got me pissed)
Better fall back
For I give that bitch a lisp (Boom boom boom)
Money on my house
Give a fuck about my wrist

Bet I make that nigga it (Huh)
I know that I'm rich
But that's my project bitch
Loyalty mean somethin'
To my bitch she won't switch
Loyalty mean somethin'
To my bitch she won't switch
