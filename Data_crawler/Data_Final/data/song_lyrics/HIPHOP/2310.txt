Song Name: Fenty
You know what it is
When you hear that "Haan"
NAV, what up?
Six-hundred-fifty horses in my engine
I used to ride round on the ten speed
Addicted to buying jewelry
I got VVS diamonds, that hit like some Fenty (bling)
Get turks and cake hoes, ran it out an island
We hopping off, boosting some jetskis (let's go)
My enemies talkin' 'bout me, made me laugh
'Cause it sound like a joke when they dead me
I like my women in flavors, like I like my weed
Need a strand, I'm designing the sea
Lookin' for rats, I've been setting up traps
Had to make sure that no one gon' come for my cheese
Gold on my neck, sitting on a new tee
When I drop a single, it go platinum, at least
Playin' my role, but when it's time to go
I know everybody gonna listen to me
Drop a bag and they gon' hit 'em for me
But they'll do it for free
Put my finger, they gon' get him for me
Homicide Unit gon' pick up the pieces
Already blessed with, so don't give me your blessings
I'm sipping on syrup, I ain't ever gon' sneeze
All of my steppers gon' step up for me
Like a Super Soaker, hit 'em, drench up his teeth
Got a disease, I've been rolling off free
They gon' check if I breathe, any time that I sleep
Seen a lil' boy that was talkin' 'bout me
Made him kiss my ring, he almost kneeled to my feet
Posting about me on the 'Gram is getting out of hand
I know this victim is miscuing
Gotta protect the bag at all times
Everybody leaving when I wanna leave
Six-hundred-fifty horses in my engine
I used to ride round on the ten speed
Addicted to buying jewelry
I got VVS diamonds, that hit like some Fenty (bling)
Get turks and cake hoes, ran it out an island
We hopping off, boosting some jetski's (let's go)
My enemies talkin' 'bout me, made me laugh
'Cause it sound like a joke when they dead me
I like my women in flavors, like I like my weed
Need a strand, I'm designing the sea
Lookin' for rats, I've been setting up traps
Had to make sure that no one gon' come for my cheese
Gold on my neck, sitting on a new tee
When I drop a single, it go platinum, at least {(Montana)
Playin' my role, but when it's time to go (yeah)
I know everybody gonna listen to me
Gold on my neck (gold on my neck), order Patek (order Patek)
Only thing free if you calling collect (calling collect)
Shoutout to Max, I'ma get to the check (get to the check)
So, when you come home, you ain't missing a step (woo)
We cop and we owning, you driving a lease
We drop a single, go diamond, at least
Crib on the West, that guy on the East
Shootout with killers and slide
With the freaks (bah, bah, bah)
Three-hundred-fifty I charge for the feature
I'm from New York, where they robbing the preacher
I ride Bugattis, no Bentleys
You pay for the box, I get neck free (haha)
Neck like a jeweler, I pop your medulla
They needed a shooter, they sent me (haan, Coke Boy, baby)
Steak like a ruler, teach like a tutor
Suckers I hit, tryna test me (haan, Montana)
Six-hundred-fifty horses in my engine
I used to ride round on the ten speed
Addicted to buying jewelry
I got VVS diamonds, that hit like some Fenty (bling)
Get turks and cake hoes, ran it out an island
We hopping off, boosting some jetskis (let's go)
My enemies talkin' 'bout me, made me laugh
'Cause it sound like a joke when they dead me
I like my women in flavors, like I like my weed
Need a strand, I'm designing the sea
Lookin' for rats, I've been setting up traps
Had to make sure that no one gon' come for my cheese
Gold on my neck, sitting on a new tee
When I drop a single, it go platinum, at least
Playing my role, but when it's time to go
I know everybody gonna listen to me
