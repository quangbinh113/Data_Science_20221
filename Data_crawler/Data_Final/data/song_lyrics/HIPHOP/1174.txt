Song Name: By Your Side
Pipe that shit up TNT
Where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Hey
It's November, where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Young nigga way outta state
Fucked up, gettin' over pain, look how far a nigga came
You remember I ain't had a thing
Fucked up, walkin' through the rain
At the top of the game, should've seen the niggas I was tryna bring
It's crazy the way these niggas change
Tell the city girl chill, you know baby mama know the deal
She know I could beat that pussy, okay
Okay, let's switch the subject, notice that both of my wrists is flooded
I been grindin' so hard, gеttin' to this money
I been working like I know the drought is coming
Monday to Monday, Sunday to Sunday, you know I'm street running
Okay, my daddy was a gangstеr, what the fuck that made me?
Niggas claiming that it's love dawg, but it can't be
Know I fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
And my pocket rocket on me, homie don't reach
Fuck dying in my Cuban link, I'm living in my Richard Millie
I just finished my tour, what a wonderful feeling
I got inside my bag and got out my feelings
I'm out my feelings
Hey there everybody, what's it like in your city?
I'm a thousand miles away but look, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do, oh
Times Square couldn't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true
Look, look
Hey there everybody, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen, close your eyes
Uh, listen to my voice, it's my disguise

By your, your side
By your side

By your side, yeah, yeah
Watching you close
