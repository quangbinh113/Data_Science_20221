Song Name: Livin' My Truth
Uh-uh, dude
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Lights flicker for the mighty rager nigga (I like)
When the girlies lookin', please don't ask for pictures (it's a)
Mission every day, just livin' out some scriptures (we here)
We forever (know that), I won't miss you (uh-uh)
Turn it loud, it don't matter when and how (it's cool)
I feel I graduated, time I take a bow (salute)
New adventures, we escapin' with the crew (as we do)
Get all in it (haha), no more slackin' (be a beast)
(Mmm-hmm)
This life goes on and on, yeah (mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah (mmm-hmm)
In this life it goes on and on, yeah (mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth, livin' with (love)
True story is the temper of the chosen (we are)
Hands high, feelin' right, I'm Rosie golden (we off)
To new experience, memories I'm holdin' (feel like)
I'm a winner (uh-uh), never losin' (nah-uh)
I remember, like my mama used to tell me (you can)
Do anythin', no matter what they tell me (papa)
He'd be proud, he'd be smilin' from the clouds (no doubt)
I got my angels (and God), on my job (to the moon)
(Mmm-hmm)
This life goes on and on, yeah (mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah (mmm-hmm)
In this life it goes on and on, yeah (mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth, livin' with (love)
