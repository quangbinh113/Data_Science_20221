Five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a- (oh)
Shawty poppin' it for tips (tips now)
Started at the crib (woah), now she poppin' at the strip (strip now)
We was at the crib then she turned it into LIV (yeah)
She just left Miami, she just got that booty lift (lift now)
You with a, with a hit, would you get it? (Hit)
Emptyin' all the clips, don't you get it? (Clips)
Claim to fit, don't you get it?
Five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a-, oh, you have to ask up, know exactly where you've been
You've been countin' bags up
You ain't doin' all that extra (extra) to make a fast cut (uh-huh)
If you cop at least a hunnid, she might pull a fast one (naah)
Five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a- (oh)

Let me hit you back, only wantin' her (four!)
We ain't comin' from, it ain't groupie love (yeah!)
Let me hit you back, only waitin' her

Movin' all the plots, I might have to tip her (wow)
Don't open your mouth, don't open your mouth
Don't open your mouth, don't open your-
Five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a-
