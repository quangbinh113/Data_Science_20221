Song Name: Shots
Internet Money, bitch
We love you, Tecca
Yeah, ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
Got bad bitches come wherever I go
Married to the money, I can't cheat with no hoe
Nigga run up on me, guarantee we gon' blow
I ain't helping nobody, if you ask me, it's a no
If I tell you that I love you, better keep it on the lo-o-ow
I got places that I'm really tryna go-o-o
So if you're down for the ride, let me know
Hollow chase a nigga, never chase opps
I committed to money, I never chase thots
And I'm attracted to guala so I'ma chase guap
Yeah, I'm attracted to guala so I'ma chase guap
Yeah, ooh, with the shits
Niggas, they be talkin', we gon' shoot
Got your bitch
Shawty said she love me, I don't really love her
Yeah, ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah
Ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah
