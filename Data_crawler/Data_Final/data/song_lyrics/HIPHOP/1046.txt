Whoa, yeah
It's a Virgo world for real, play with my name, we'll send this bitch up
All this Chrome, sticks like Tony, I'm finna bend this bitch up
Never been phony, you can't extort me, I'm finna send this bitch up
Niggas seen M's before they could drink, you gotta get your shit up
It's only the guys bangin' the fives, no, we not linkin' it up

I'll give you advice, better think twice before you come runnin' up
