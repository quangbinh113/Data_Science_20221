Song Name: Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) - 2018 Remaster
It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you want to know-know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal I'm making?
You, it's you and me
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh
You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh
You, it's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy
Come on baby, come on darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, come on, come on darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh
If I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
And be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
And be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, I'd be running out that hill
If I only could, I'd be running out that hill
