Song Name: Remind Me
Millions of hours become days
Your pictures, they keep me awake
I was trying to find ya, see if the love was still the same
Visions of us that don't fade
We were holding on, hoping it don't break
But now that we're dancing, it's all coming back to me
There was something good we lost along the way (oh yeah, yeah)
And the melody is just not quite the same
I said, "I can't sing along
'Cause I forgot the song
So how does it go?
Could you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Could you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Will you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
And did it go, "Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
Or did it go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
I think it went, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
Oh, could you please remind me?
I needed the time to find me
I made a mistake and I'm sorry (whoa-oh-oh)
If we try this again, I promise that I will never leave (no I won't)
There was something good we lost along the way (oh yeah, yeah)
And the melody is just not quite the same
I said, "I can't sing along
'Cause I forgot the song
So how does it go?
Could you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Could you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Will you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
And did it go, "Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
Or did it go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
I think it went, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
Oh, could you please remind me?
Remind me of all those nights
And all those fights
And all those times we said, "Goodbye"
All I'm asking is "why?"
Would you please remind me?
She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Will you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
(Darling, tell me) did it go, "Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
Or did it go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"?
I think it went, "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
Could you please remind me?
