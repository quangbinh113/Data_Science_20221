Song Name: Hard To Be Human
For a second
I almost forgot all the wreckage
This hole full of hurt where my chest is
I felt like a person again
For a minute
I almost got lost in existence
The birds sang their song and I listened
There wasn't a thought in my head
But it never lasts
I just fall right back
It's hard to be human
Don't know what I'm doing half the time
'Cause I'm only a man with a pen in his hand
And a couple of stories to write
It's hard to be human
Wish I had a blueprint for life
'Cause I'm only a dot on this old spinning rock
I guess I'm just along for the ride
It's hard to be human
It's hard to be human sometimes
Someone stop me
From pouring my fourth cup of coffee
I'm shaking, my heart's going off beat
But at least, I can get out of bed
Someone tell me
That six hours of screen time is healthy
That it's okay as long as it helps me
Forget that the world's gonna end
But it never lasts
I just fall right back
It's hard to be human
Don't know what I'm doing half the time
'Cause I'm only a man with a pen in his hand
And a couple of stories to write
It's hard to be human
Wish I had a blueprint for life
'Cause I'm only a dot on this old spinning rock
I guess I'm just along for the ride
It's hard to be human
It's hard to be human sometimes
