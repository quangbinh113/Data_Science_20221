Song Name: I AM WOMAN
I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it going on
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on
Got it on going on, ya
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on, yeah)
I'm classy, I'm modern, I live by my own design
I'm cherry, I'm lemon, I'm the sweetest key lime pie
I'm electric, I'm bass, I'm the beat of my own drum
I could make your goosebumps raise
With the tracing of my thumb
Only love can get inside me
I move in my own timing
Voice of the future speak to me kindly
I feel what I want and somehow it finds me
Somehow it finds me
Somehow it finds me
Yeah! Hey, hey!
I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it going on
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on
Got it on going on, ya
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on)
(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on, yeah)
Hear no evil, speak no evil
I am not the one to curse
They can talk that shit about you
Long as you know that it's false
I am earthly, I am heaven
I am what I like to be
When I ask for what I want
Somehow it finds me
Somehow it finds me
Yeah! Hey, hey!
I am woman, I am fearless
I am sexy, I'm divine
I'm unbeatable, I'm creative
Honey, you can get in line
I am feminine, I am masculine
I am anything I want
I can teach you, I can love you
If you got it going on
If you got it, got it, got it, got it
Got it, got it, got it going on
Got it going on, got it going on, got it going on
