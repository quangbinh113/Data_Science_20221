Song Name: I Burned LA Down
You left a hole in my chest when you left
And my heart followed you out the door
And I stood and bled in the hall, watched it all
And the mess that it left on the floor
If I gave you less, would you want me more?
And you could've said anything at all
Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter, broken heart
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there
I waste my breath on a prayer, you don't carе
I was never a part of the plan
You can't makе a God of somebody
Who's not even half of a half-decent man
Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter, broken heart
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there
I burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there
You left a hole in my chest when you left
And my heart followed you out the door
