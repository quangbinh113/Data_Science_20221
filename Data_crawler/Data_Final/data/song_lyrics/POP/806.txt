Song Name: LAST PICTURE SHOW
(The good times we spent together)
(That old picture show and you)
I can still see your smiling face
No matter how i try the memory never fades
You and me a rainy sunday sharing our sweet love
But still i see your face
Last picture show my love i'm still burning
Inside
Remembering the times we used to share
Last picture show my love its so hard for me to
Believe, i still love you so
※Rainy days oh so sleepless nights wondering
If you still really care
Oh memories of how it used to be you and me
Our last picture show※
I find it hard and still can't understand
Why you had to go cause boy i loved you so
Is this a dream how can this be
You went away from me and took my heart along
Last picture show my dream took my heart and now
You leave
How could someone like you be so cold
Last picture show for me i understand so just
Let it be
Still i can't let you go
(※くり返し)
Last picture show my love i'm still burning
Inside
Remembering the times we used to share
Last picture show my love it's so hard for me to
Believe
I am so all alone
Some where in tme maybe your eyes will meet mine
Maybe our love will grow again
So i'll wait for you in this same old space
Where we shared our last picture show
