Song Name: Lionheart (Fearless)
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Heart, heart
A lionheart
To be fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel i bleed in my blood (blood, blood, blood, blood)
Let the stars illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart)
(A lionheart)
A lionheart
Oh, I look in the mirror
Teardrops in my eyes
Makes it hard to see clearly
Lookin' for a sign tonight
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know what it feels like
To wake up like a giant
I wanna know what it feels like
To be fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel i bleed in my blood (blood, blood, blood, blood)
Let the stars illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart)
(A lionheart)
A lionheart
I can feel it (heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (heart, heart, heart, heart)
A lionheart
To be fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel i bleed in my blood (a lion heart)
Let the stars illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (heart, heart)
(A lionheart)
