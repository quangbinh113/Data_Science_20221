Song Name: uh oh
(Uh-oh-oh)
Feel your eyes watchin' me
So, I'm movin' on him just so you can see
Told you I was gonna get you right back (right back)
Oh, you don't really like that? (Oh)
I'm lost again (oh), when you walk away (oh)
You know if you leave, I ain't gonna stay (oh-oh-oh)
When I'm doin' good, you get me off track (oh)
And I guess I kinda like that (oh)
You make me really, really, good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missing
Seven texts and two missed calls
Know I can't ignore 'em all
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied (oh)
Uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow, I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now, we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
Roll your eyes like you do
Should have known it's always the same with you
Tryin' not to feel our connection
But, oh my God, it's kinda temptin'
You said, "Can we leave now?" (oh)
I don't think we should (oh)
Through the back door (oh)
That won't end good (oh)
Now at my place
Shit, you know I would (oh)
Gonna follow you out when nobody looks
You make me really, really, good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'

Seven texts and two missed calls
Make you wait before I fall
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied (oh)
Uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again (oh-oh)
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again (ooh-ooh)
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow, I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb (numb)
Uh-oh, now, we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
(Again, again)
(Again, again)
(Again, again)
Again, again
