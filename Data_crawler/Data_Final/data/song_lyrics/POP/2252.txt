Song Name: I Donâ€™t Think That I Like Her
Get her name and get her number
Find out all of the things that we have in common
Never all the differences, oh, yeah
Meet her parents, meet her brother
Then she starts sleeping over the crib on weekends
Like a real relationship, oh, no
For me, the stars are aligning
But for her, it's bad timing
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, oh-oh
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, oh-oh
So I woke up on a rebound
And I say that I'm gonna be single for life
But she's so pretty and nice (pretty and nice)
So I make just one exception
But I find out eventually I'm not her type
Baby, that's the reason why, that
For me, the stars are aligning
But for her, it's bad timing
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that I like her anymore (yeah)
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, oh-oh
I don't think that I like her anymore (no)
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, oh-oh
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm trying not to be bitter
But damn it, I'll miss her
'Cause she's one of a kind (one of a kind)
For me, the stars are aligning
But for her, it's bad timing
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls all are the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, oh-oh
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls all are the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart (yeah), oh-oh
(I don't think that I like her anymore)
(Girls are all the same)
(All they wanna do...)
Then we fall, we fall, fall, fall apart now
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, oh-oh
