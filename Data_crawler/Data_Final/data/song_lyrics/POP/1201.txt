Song Name: Where Did You Go? (feat. MNEK)
Oh, my love, where did you go?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
With all my love, where did you go now?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love (oh, oh, oh)
You just have to walk in the place
And all eyes (and all eyes) are on you (are on you)
You could put a smile on your face
And you'd light up the room
But then you left me dancing on the floor alone
And now the DJ's calling, all the lights are on
You see, I tried to find you, but words can't describe you
Baby, only one night ain't enough
Oh, my love, where did you go?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
With all my love, where did you go now?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love (oh, oh, oh)
You're so beautiful, you're a star
Light through a divide, wherever you are
You'll always be the one who got away (got away)
And now I can't forget you, how could I let you?
Leave me dancing on the floor alone
And now the DJ's calling, all the lights are on
You see, I tried to find you, but words can't describe you
Baby, only one night ain't enough
Oh, my love, where did you go?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
With all my love, where did you go now?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love
Where did you go? (Where did you go my love?)
With my love (I wanna know)
Where did you go? (Where did you go? Where did you go?)
With my love, with my love
Where did you go? (Where did you go? Where did you go?)
With my love, with my love
Where did you go?
