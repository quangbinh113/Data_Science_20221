Song Name: Coastal Night Out
Over the seaside
I see my future drown in the sea
Driving on a coastal way
I'm getting away from this city
Over the seaside
I see your face fading away
Driving on a coastal way
I might regret what's goin down
Babe are you sure?
Are we gettin away?
You said "I'm your fuel and you are my fire
Then we'll be gone today
And not be found in anywhere
Let's get high let's kill the night
Driving fast in coastal way
Let's get high let's chill outside
This might be our last night out
Miles and miles away
달리는 도로의 밤 바다는
Miles and miles away
왜 아직 멀게만 느껴 질까
Babe im not sure
Are we getting away?
You're not my fuel and i'm not your
Fire You'll be left out alone again
Cause I'll be falling into that sea
Let's get high let's kill the night
Driving fast in coastal way
Let's get high let's chill outside
This will be our last night out
Tell me if I'm driving too fast
It's our last night out in coastal way
We must get high we must kill our future
This will be our last night out
