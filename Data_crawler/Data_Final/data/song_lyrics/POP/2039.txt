Song Name: B.O.T.A. (Baddest Of Them All) - Edit
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
Do you wanna dance, baby?
I know you see me looking at you on the daily
Ooh, I'm in a trance lately
I need something to wake me up, something to phase me
Do you wanna dance, baby?
I know you see me looking at you on the daily
Ooh, I'm in a trance lately
I need something to wake me up, something to phase me
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
She's the baddest of them all
The baddest of them all
I need something to phase me
I need something to phase me
Are you the one, baby?
'Cause you really amaze me
You wanna dance, baby?
I know you see me looking at you on the daily
Ooh, I'm in a trance lately
I need something to wake me up, something to phase me
Do you want a kiss maybe?
I know I seen you looking at me, you wanna date me
Ooh, I feel my knees go shaky
Everything you do, it just seems to amaze me
