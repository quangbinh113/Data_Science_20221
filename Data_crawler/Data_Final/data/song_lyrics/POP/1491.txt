Song Name: Suckerpunch
I met you
In the third week of June back in 2016
From that look in your eyes to the back of the taxi
Said, "We should go dancin', we should go dancin'"
And the chemistry, the chemistry
It hit me like that, that, that
And the serotonin flutterin'
It hit me so bad
Like a sucker punch straight to my heart
Uh, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, and kiss me right now
Sucker punch, you caught me off guard
Uh, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, and kiss me right now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Guess I didn't know that love could hit me this hard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Guess I didn't know that love could hit me this hard
I spend all of my time buildin' these walls
Somehow, you got the brick to make them fall
Had one too many nights with drunk missed calls
But you keep me up in my phone
I was lost in transit
You, you found me stranded
I, I just can't stand it
You, you hit me just like
Like a sucker punch straight to my heart
Uh, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, and kiss me right now
Sucker punch, you caught me off guard
Uh, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, and kiss me right now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Guess I didn't know that love could hit me this hard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Guess I didn't know that love could hit me this hard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, you know it hit me like that)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, you know it hit me so bad)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, you know it hit me like that)
Guess I didn't know that love could hit me this hard
