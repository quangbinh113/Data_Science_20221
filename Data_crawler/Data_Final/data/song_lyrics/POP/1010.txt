Song Name: Sunshine (feat. Lil Wayne & Childish Gambino)
(Bongo by the way)
Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me (what?)
They use my couch when they needed the therapy (shit)
Took what they needed but never took care of me (yeah)
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me (yeah, yeah)
Sunshine on me (uh)
Sunshine on me
I just let the sunshine on me (yeah-yeah)
Sunshine on me
I just let the sunshine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sunshine on me, yeah, yeah
Yeah, pray if they run up, I'ma cut up (brr)
Bring out these VVs, like the sun up (yeah)
These niggas Stevie, 'til the come up
Went got my bread up, let 'em wonder
If I ain't do nothin' I kept it one hundred (ayy)
Big Latto for real, I ain't never done frontin' (not)
They do what they can, bitch I do what I wanna (bitch)
Trimmin' they pockets, I told 'em to run it (run)
Sunshine on me
Every time I leave the crib I got it on me (brr)
Got it out the mud, I did it by my lonely (yeah)
Pop my shit, done bein' low-key (bitch, bitch)
Sunshine on me (ayy-ayy)
I ain't givin' none these hatin' bitches no peace (ah)
Fuck a two cent, you could get the two-piece (poo, poo)
If I step back, hit you with the 223
Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me
Sunshine on me

The God and the sun and the light like Apollo, Tunechi
Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan murder me
Sunshine on me
I love when it's sunny, that boy ain't no dummy
I slide off a gummy, y'all heard I got money
But still dressin' bummy, I'm sweeter than honey
I'm sweeter at rapping, he like what the fuck happened?
Came back and he snappin', came back with a passion
These niggas was cappin', they talkin' on me, mm
I bought a .9 when that Covid hit
She said my Gucci don't go with it
Just tryna be happy, get money the model
My girl hit the lotto, my sons all mulatto
My sons are all healthy, ain't shit you can tell me
I'm hotter than Nelly, they say that I'm smelly
Ain't never smelled wealthy, I think
Yeah, I got mass drip like a sink
Skated, you not in the rink
Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me
Sunshine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sunshine on me (shine)
Sunshine on me (shine)
I just let the sunshine on me (shine)
(I get my shine on) sunshine on me
(I get my shine on) I just let the sunshine on me, yeah, yeah
(I get my shine on, bitch, I'm the golden child)
