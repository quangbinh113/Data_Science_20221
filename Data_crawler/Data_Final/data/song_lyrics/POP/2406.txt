Song Name: life, i'm over you
I'm only 18 and I feel like I'm dyin'
I'm gettin' sad too soon
I hope I make it 'cause I'm tryin'
I've loved and I've lost
And realized that it's all my fault
Wish someone loved me enough
To catch me when I fall, hmm
And I know it's kinda selfish, but
It's not my choice to leave
'Cause I wish I could stay
But it's more of a need for me to go away
I'm tired of the world hatin' on me
I wake up to the friends that I can't keep
And when the end is near and I'm asleep
I'll be chasin' dreams while countin' sheep
Hmm, hmm
When I turn 19, I'ma feel like I'm flyin'
I'm in the sky where, where I'm free and I'm smilin'
But 'til then
Things will stay in the same
Things will never change
Life will be a mess
And that life I became hopelessly in love
With doin' what my brain tells me to do
And life, I'm over you
