Song Name: What Cha' Gonna Do for Me
All night and day just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend the time that I spend alone
The time that you lose exploiting the blues, won't get the job done
As hard as it bites, I'm keepin' my sights on you
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me?
When the chips are down
In the cool of the night when nothing seems right
The feeling can take you, strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true
If you try to conceal the way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry, I'm keeping my eye on you
What cha' gonna do for me? (Uhm I wanna go and get stuff for ya)
What cha' gonna do for me? (Tell me truly)
What cha' gonna do for me?
When the chips are down
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me? What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me?
When the chips are down
You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss
Aha aha
What cha' gonna do for me? What cha' gonna do, boy?
What cha' gonna do for me? What's on your mind?
What cha' gonna do for me? Ooh
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me? (What cha' gonna do? What cha' gonna do?)
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do for me?
What cha' gonna do, boy? What cha' gonna do?
