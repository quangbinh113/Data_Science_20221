Song Name: Tripping Over Air
I hear you talking in your sleep again
You're holding onto something real
Can't get enough of what's been in your head
Our secret's out and I'm feeling this
Is there something on your mind 'cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time but
I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm tripping over air
Trying to read your mind
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm tripping over air
Trying to get it right
So why'd you go ahead and tell your friends?
You got me twisted up in how I feel
You love to start then stop then start again
But I hate the way that I'm feeling this
Is there something on your mind 'cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time but
I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know, but I don't fucking care)
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm tripping over air
Trying to read your mind (trying to read your mind)
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm tripping over air
Trying to get it right
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know, but I don't fucking care)
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm tripping over air
Trying to get it right (trying to get it right)
