Song Name: Creep
Yes, it's me again
And I'm back (creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby (creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah (creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby (creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah (creep)
The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection, oh
So I creep, yeah
I just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep
The 23rd of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving until the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh
So I creep, yeah
I just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep
I think about us, baby, all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah, can you dig it?
Love you forever, baby, soul and mind
And you know if I don't get it I'ma get mine
(Oh, so I creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby (so I creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah (so I creep)
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So I creep, yeah (I creep around)
I just keep it on the down-low (because I need attention)
(Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah (I creep around)
'Cause he doesn't know what I do (because I need attention)
(Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah (oh I, oh I)
I just keep it on the down-low (oh I, oh I, yeah)
(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do (oh I, oh I, yeah)
(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
So I creep, yeah
I just keep it on the down-low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention, goes to show
