Song Name: i miss you (skin to skin)
All those nights
Where we laughed until the sun came up
I had to have you
And no matter how late it got
I didn't even care if my mom found out
I had to
Now I'm lyin' in my bed
I've been in it since you left
Truth is nothin' that you said
Could make me love you less
I hate myself for missin', missin' you
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could forget you, but it's so hard to
I know I'm not supposed to
I, I miss you, I, I miss you
I, I miss you...
Reckless nights
It was dangerous but you got me so high
What happened to you?
'Cause we went from skin-to-skin
To you never wanna see me ever again
Said you had to, why'd you have to?
Now I'm lyin' in my bed
I've been in it since you left
Truth is nothin' that you said
Could make me love you less
I hate myself for missin', missin' you
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could forget you, but it's so hard to
I know I'm not supposed to
I, I miss you, I, I miss you
I, I miss you...
All those stupid fights that go 'til I cry
I don't know how to leave them behind
Venom falls from your lips
The same ones I used to kiss
And I'm tryin' to get you out of my mind
I hate myself (I hate myself)
For missin', missin' you (miss you)
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could (I wish I could) forget you
But it's so hard to (hard to)
I know I'm not supposed to
I, I miss you, I, I miss you
I, I miss you...
I, I miss you, I, I miss you
I, I miss you
