Song Name: Worth It (feat. Kid Ink)
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Okay, I tell her bring it back like she left some
Bring it-bring it back like she left some
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy for, come and show me that you
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
Stop playin', how you know that I
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
What you actin' shy for?
Just gimme you, just give me you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may take a lot of stuff
Guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'ma call you bluff
Hurry up, I'm waiting out front
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got, now come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue
Not a clue, I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don't like it, like it too soft
I like it a little rough, not too much, but maybe just enough
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got, now come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby I'm worth it (give me everything)
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Okay, I tell her bring it back like she left some
Bring it-bring it back like she left some
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy for, come and show me that you
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
Stop playin', how you know that I
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
What you actin shy' for?
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, you see me in the spot like "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got, now come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby I'm worth it (give me everything)
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
