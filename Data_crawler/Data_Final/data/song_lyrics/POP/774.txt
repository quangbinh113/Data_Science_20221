Song Name: Julie
No one ever understands you, Julie
The third eye of yours makes you far from reach
In front of the TV all the time
Frowning at the TV shows
And I have so much to let you know
1234, 1234
Julie, please be free
Do whatever you need to do
Nothing to weep for anymore
No, you don't need to worry
Julie, be free
Do whatever you need to do
Nothing to weep for anymore
No, you don't have to worry
One more whiskey joke
The one who laughs hurt you the most
And I have so much to let you know
And I have so much to let you know
1234, 1234
Julie, please be free
Do whatever you need to do
Nothing to weep for anymore
No, you don't need to worry
Julie, be free
Do whatever you need to do
Nothing to weep for anymore
No, you don't have to worry
No, you don't need to worry again
No, you don't need to worry again
No, you don't need to worry again
