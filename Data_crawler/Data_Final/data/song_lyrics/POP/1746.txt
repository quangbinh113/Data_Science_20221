Song Name: Sure Thing
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom
Painter, baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise the bet 'cause you're a joker
Checked off, you are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
You can be the talk and I can be the walk
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could be the lover, I'll be the fighter, babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter, babe
Fire it up
Writer, baby, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric, baby, you could be the note
Record that
Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner and it's you
What did I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I'll be the pen
Said I'm the one, 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
Now rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah
Now rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah
This love, between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, is it a sure thing? Yeah-yeah
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
