Song Name: Grapefruit
Counting while I run the tap, I'm on my knees
Choking on my hands all night in my sleep
Counting all the calories, now get 'em up
Body positivity, help me out
The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me
I'd die for my love, though break
Break 'til I wither away
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
One, two, grapefruit, how am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more, I know my mirrors are lying
Five, six, hate this, take back the body I'm in
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
One, two, grapefruit, wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more, kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this, how am I still in this fight?
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
Sweet girl, you're so disciplined, now keep it down
I don't like my measurements, won't make a sound
Diana, how she guards the clock (the clock)
She's in control (control)
Now, why is everyone in shock? (In shock)
You let her go
The swans of ballet ('llet)
Their skin and their bones, that's not me (me)
I'd die for my love, though break (break)
Break 'til I wither away
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
One, two, grapefruit, how am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more, I know my mirrors are lying
Five, six, hate this, take back the body I'm in
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
One, two, grapefruit, wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more, kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this, how am I still in this fight?
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me, oh)
What I see is not me, what I see is not me (me)
When I'm hurting, every time I have a bad day
Then everyone gets lost (lost)
But I'm learning every time I feel out of place
That you are all I've got (oh-ooh)
One, two, grapefruit, how am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more, I know my mirrors are lying
Five, six, hate this, take back the body I'm in (ooh)
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
One, two, grapefruit, wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more, kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this, how am I still in this fight?
(What I see is not me, what I see is not me)
