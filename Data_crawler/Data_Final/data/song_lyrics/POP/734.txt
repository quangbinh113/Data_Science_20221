Song Name: And Time Froze
Streams afar flowing away
Into the midst of the stars
Where you can carry me all the way
Into your dreams
Where life carries on
And time froze
Please don't take me whole, away
Hey, it's me at your door
Won't you come out and play
Would you climb up a tree
With me and touch the sky
Where life carries on
And time froze
Please don't take me whole, away
