Song Name: Starting Line
Nobody knows my name
Did I melt into these walls I've made
I did everything I thought was right
Got my stapler, got my shirt and tie
Set me up to zone out pushing paper
Slamming the stapler
Punching the clock until five
Holding out to get up to the stage
Now I'm turning the page
Feel the rush in my veins
Stepping into the light
Been kicking my feet on the starting line
Now I'm chasing a feeling
Showing up to the stage, let the crowd decide
Been working my game in a brand new light
Now I'm breaking the ceiling
I'm done chasing a dream from the starting line
Never gonna be a perfect time
To let go of all my safety lines (all my safety lines)
Looking down into the drop below
Nothing to catch me will I ever know
Set me up to burn out, I'll be thriving
No money, surviving on love for the thrill of it all (for the thrill of it all)
Holding out for the taste of a secret I'm keeping, believe me
Can't keep still on the edge of my seat
Been kicking my feet on the starting line
Now I'm chasing a feeling(feeling)
Showing up to the stage, let the crowd decide
Been working my game in a brand new light
Now I'm breaking the ceiling(ceiling)
I'm done chasing a dream from the starting line
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've been patient
I've been waiting
I've been here on the starting line
I've been patient
I've been waiting
I've been here on the width
Been kicking my feet on the starting line
Now I'm chasing a feeling (feeling)
Showing up to the stage, let the crowd decide
Been working my game in a brand new light
Now I'm breaking the ceiling (ceiling)
I'm done chasing a dream from the starting line
