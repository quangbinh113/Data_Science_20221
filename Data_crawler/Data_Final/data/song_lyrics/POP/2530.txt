Song Name: Stay the Night
Stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
Stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night
Yeah, I've been missing you
Feels like we're back in July and
We're touching down on the island
Still got that look in your eye, mm, mm
I, I, I, I, I
I feel like you just left the room
You're right here and I'm missing you
I, I, I, I, I
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
Stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright
So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
So stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night
'Cause I've been missing you
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night
Yeah, I've been missing you
Bring back the fire, can we just
Still stay those kids in Ibiza?
Late nights and too much tequila, mm
I, I, I, I, I
I feel like you just left the room
You're right here and I'm missing you
I, I, I, I, I
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
So stay the night (the night)
Even if we both get lost inside the lights (inside the lights)
We'll be alright
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night (ooh)
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night
Yeah, I've been missing you
Stay the night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
The night, night, night, night
