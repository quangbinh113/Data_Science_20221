Song Name: Lemon
Oh, no, I saw you on the TV today
You made me dizzy automatically
Baby, you couldn't be my lady, okay
Envy, it's always automatic to me
You, lemonade
Such a beauty on the TV
You, lemonade
Can you see me (Oh, no)
You, lemonade
Such a beauty on the TV
You, lemonade
Can you see me (Oh, no)
Oh, no, it could be an addiction again
You make my life so cinematic, always
Baby, you shouldn't be my lady, okay
Envy, I dream one day it listens to me
You, lemonade
Such a beauty on the TV
You, lemonade
Can you see me (Oh, no)
You, lemonade
Such a beauty on the TV
You, lemonade
Can you see me (Oh, no)
You, lemonade
Such a beauty on the TV
You, lemonade
Can you see me (Oh, no)
