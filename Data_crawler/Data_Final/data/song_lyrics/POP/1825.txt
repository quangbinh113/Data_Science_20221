Song Name: everything
I could blame it on the physical
I could blame it on your lips, your touch, your kiss
You know, real traditional
But your love's too original
You are anything but conventional
Baby, did you know that
From the moment we fell in, I knew we couldn't fall back?
Knew I'd always crawl back, ooh, woah
'Cause baby, it's the everything for me, for me, for me
Baby, it's the everything for me, for me, oh, for me
'Cause baby, it's the everything, no trying
You be shining, my silver lining
'Cause baby, it's the everything for me, for me, yeah, oh, for me
Love the way you teach me
Love the way you listen
You know all my details
You so damn attentive
You got my attention, babe
Can't forget to mention, babe
I'ma keep you lifted
You so fuckin' gifted
And how many girls out in the world can say that they had it?
And how many bitches that became your misses can maintain the status?
That was before me, you childish, you done with your wildin'
Now you can be wild with me, run that mile with me
Catch some flights out with me, oh
I match your energy, match your fly perfectly
Lips lock intensively, want you extensively
I know you was made for me, think you was made with me
Shit feel like destiny
'Cause baby, it's the everything for me, for me, oh, for me
This is such a different thing for me, for me, yeah, oh, for me
Baby, it's the everything, no trying
You be shining, my silver lining
'Cause baby, it's the everything for me, for me, yeah, oh, for me

Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
