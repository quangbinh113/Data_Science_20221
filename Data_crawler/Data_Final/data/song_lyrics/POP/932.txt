Song Name: Back Pocket
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh-oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh, oh, oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read when I'm alone
Do you like me? Circle yes or no
On this piece of paper
'Cause I really, really need to know
Are you gonna be my 5th grade queen?
Hand it back after second hour
Then I will know if you're gonna be my special flower
Ooh girl 'cause I need to know
I will
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh, oh, oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone
When you kissed me on the playground
I lost my breath, I had to lay down
And assess what I had seen
Then I had to write the words out
'Cause you took 'em out of my mouth
But it's hard for me to read
Out loud, oh gee
Oh gosh
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh-oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late, girl
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh-oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
