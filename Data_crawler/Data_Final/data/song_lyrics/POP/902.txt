Song Name: Tonight the Streets Are Ours
Do you know why you've got feelings in your heart
Don't let fear of feeling fool you
What you see sets you apart
And there's nothing here to bind you,
It's no way for life to start
But do you know that
Tonight, the streets are ours
Tonight, the streets are ours
And these lights in our hearts they tell no lies
Those people, they got nothing in their souls
And they make our TVs blind us
From our vision and our goals
Oh the trigger of time it tricks you
So you have no way to grow
But do you know that
Tonight, the streets are ours
Tonight, the streets are ours
These lights in our hearts, they tell no lies
And no one else can haunt me
The way that you can haunt me
I need to know you want me
I couldn't be without you
And the light that shines around you
No, nothing ever mattered more than not doubting
But tonight the streets are ours
Do you know how to kill loneliness at last
Oh there's so much there to heal dear
And make tears things of the past
But do you know that
Tonight, the streets are ours
Tonight, the streets are ours
These lights in our street are ours
Tonight, the streets are ours
And these lights in our hearts they tell no lies
