Song Name: Fade - English Version
Forever feels like this
I can't forget I still feel your kiss
What you said, what you wore
Where I was when you walked out the door
Don't even know my own lies
Said I'm okay but still I cry
And I try, and I try to hold on like it won't end
So tonight I might just dream of you
Every song I hear gives me the blues
I see rain but maybe they're all tears for you
Can you please just fade away, away?
So this pain can stay away, always?
My heart is a little slow
You're unforgettable, I can't let go
Can you please just fade away, away?
So this pain can stay away, always?
Not crying but my eyes both have not been dry for days
Without you I'll never be okay
Forever feels like this
Like a broken watch I can't fix
From the moon to the sun
Yeah, I'm missing your love and lips
If I had just one wish
To hold you close just like we did
If I can't, if I missed my last chance I would rather not live
So tonight I might just dream of you
Every song I hear gives me the blues
I see rain but maybe they're all tears for you
Can you please just fade away, away?
So this pain can stay away, always?
My heart is a little slow
You're unforgettable, I can't let go
Can you please just fade away, away?
So this pain can stay away, always?
Not crying but my eyes both have not been dry for days
Without you I'll never be okay
Like never seen before, want you to fade away
But in my mind was so hard that you never not stay
(So this pain can stay away, away?)
(My heart is a little slow)
(You're unforgettable, I can't let go)
Can you please just fade away, away?
So this pain can stay away, away?
Not crying but my eyes both have not been dry for days
Without you I'll never be okay
(Away, away) ooh ooh
(Away, away) ooh ooh
(Away, away) ooh ooh
(Away, away)
Without you I'll never be okay
