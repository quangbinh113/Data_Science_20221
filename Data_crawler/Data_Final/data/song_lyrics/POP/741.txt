Song Name: Moscato
Love
Don't you worry, it's not your fault
For what happened in life
It's just how things should be
And love
Yesterday is all over now
Maybe our love can grow
But that's for all we know
Would you be with me
And begin again?
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
Love
You are someone I wished to see
When all my days are bright
Hope it never gets dark
And love
I will wait for you, honestly
I'm yours entirely
So how bad could it be?
Would you be with me
And begin again?
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
Here we go
To a place we can grow
It's a blessing to be in love
We've got whole life to grow
