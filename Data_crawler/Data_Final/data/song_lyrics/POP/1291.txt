Song Name: Light It Up (feat. Nyla & Fuse ODG) - Remix
Stand up like a solider, baby
Yeah, I know you're build like that
Gun it like holster, baby
Show dem say you're wicked like that
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me
Light it up
Light it up
Light it up
Show them you're flame to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up, now your aims getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day I'mma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere
One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour, ye
One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
One, two, three, everybody go
Light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up
Light it up
One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour, ye
One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
Set it ablaze like a candle wick
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah, light it up
