Song Name: Good Friends
Sometimes I don't understand you
Sometimes you don't understand me
Bridges are burning all over
But not on our street
Sometimes you take me for granted
Sometimes I can be backhanded
But you got my back while I'm holding your hand
What else do we need?
'Cause we're good friends
We don't ask why
We just show up at each other's house unannounced
In the middle of the night
We got history
No conditions
You don't ever have to worry, yeah, I'll keep you sturdy
'Cause we're good friends, yeah
Some folks are fair-weather
Some just drift in and out
At my worst or my better
You always stick around
And if we live to a hundred
Or through to the next drink
I swear to God on my heart
Nobody will know you like me
'Cause we're good friends
We don't ask why
We just show up at each other's house unannounced
In the middle of the night
We got history
No conditions
You don't ever have to worry, yeah, I'll keep you sturdy
'Cause we're good friends, yeah
Too much love
Too much dirt, too much time
Wouldn't change
Couldn't leave if we tried
Oh, too much love
Too much dirt, too much time
Wouldn't change
Couldn't leave if we tried
'Cause we're good friends
Yeah, we're good friends (yeah)
'Cause we're good friends
We don't ask why
We just show up at each other's house unannounced
In the middle of the night
It's no mystery
It's a given
You don't ever have to worry, yeah, I'll keep you sturdy
'Cause we're good friends
Yeah, good friends
Oh, good friends
