Song Name: I Have Questions
Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds, and I am trying to numb them all
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here
(I have questions for you)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve tryna tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I shoulda never ever, ever trusted you
(I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
(I have questions for you) I have questions
I have questions for you
My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now
(I have questions for you)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve tryna tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I shoulda never ever, ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
(I have questions for you) I have questions
I have questions for you
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here
I have questions for you (oh-oh)
I have questions for you
(I have questions for you) I have questions
I have questions for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I have questions for you; ooh-ooh, oh)
I have questions for you
Foul play, no, foul play, no (I have questions for you)
I have questions (I have questions for you)
I have questions for you
How do I fix it?
Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk?
(Do I wanna fix it?) I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault?
(Do you miss me?) I have questions
