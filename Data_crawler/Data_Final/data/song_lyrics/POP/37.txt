Song Name: One And Only
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day, lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try to forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worth it
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say, lose yourself in time

At the mention of my name
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Which ever road I choose, you'll go?
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try to forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worth it
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect) I know it ain't easy, (trust me, I've learned it) giving up your heart

(Nobody's perfect) I know it ain't easy, (trust me, I've learned it) giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect) I know it ain't easy, (trust me, I've learned it) giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect) I know it ain't easy, (trust me, I've learned it) giving up your heart

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worth it
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
