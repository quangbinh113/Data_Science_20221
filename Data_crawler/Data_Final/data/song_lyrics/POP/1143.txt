Song Name: 24/5
Halfway to the bottom
You, me and our problems
Stone cold when we let it slip away
Is it unfair to miss you?
Is it unkind to hate you?
To feel some kind of pleasure in the pain
Wish I could skip ahead to somewhere near the end
And maybe then I guess I'll forget you ever left
Oh my, damn this hurts so good
Always knew it would, stop it if I could
Going on for 24/5
I still feel your touch, never hurt so much
Haunted by your love, going on for 24/5
I let you change me
But you were the one to break me
And buried all my feelings underneath
Maybe, someday I won't miss you
Maybe, someday I won't hate you
But right now it's too heavy to breathe
Wish I could skip ahead to somewhere near the end
And maybe then I guess I'll forget you ever left
Oh my, damn this hurts so good
Always knew it would, stop it if I could
Going on for 24/5
I still feel your touch, never hurt so much
Haunted by your love, going on for 24/5
Replays in my head, of all the things you said
I know you're lying in somebody else's bed
Though we could make it work, but then you hurt me first
Trust me I felt it worst
Oh my, damn this hurts so good
Always knew it would, stop it if I could
Going on for 24/5
I still feel your touch, never hurt so much
Haunted by your love, going on for 24/5
