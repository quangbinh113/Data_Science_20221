Song Name: Juban District
I don't know where
You've been out again sometimes
But is it a shame–
To throw out the things you know were right?
Well, I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can
It's so good to get down at the Juban District
I'm choked up, but you'd may be pass me up
You're up in a daze
Finding out with what suits you right
I'm struck in a maze
Maybe now's the time to leave this site
Well, I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can
It's so good to get down at the Juban District
I'm choked up, but you'd maybe pass me up
Can do, I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can
It's so good to get down at the Juban District
I'm choked up but you'd maybe pass me up
(あの人さ)
(何が?)
(ちょっと今不安そうな顔しただけとさ)
(してないわよ別に)
(そう?)
(そう)
It's so good to get down at the Juban District
I'm choked up but you'd maybe pass me up
Can do, I know what I can do
I know what I can do
I know what I can
It's so good to get down at the Juban District
I'm choked up, but you'd maybe pass me up
