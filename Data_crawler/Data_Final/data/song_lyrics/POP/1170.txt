Song Name: About Damn Time
Anyway-
It's bad bitch o'clock, yeah, it's thick:30
I've been through a lot, but I'm still flirty (okay)
Is everybody back up in the building?
It's been a minute, tell me how you're healing
'Cause I'm about to get into my feelings
How you feeling? How you feel right now?
Oh, I've been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be, uh
Bitch, I might be better
Turn up the music, turn down the lights
I've got a feeling I'm gon' be alright
Okay (okay), alright
It's about damn time (time)
Turn up the music, let's celebrate (alright)
I've got a feeling I'm gon' be okay
Okay (okay), alright
It's about damn time
In a minute, I'ma need a sentimental
Man or woman to pump me up
Feeling fussy, walking in my Balenci-ussies
Tryna bring out the fabulous
'Cause I give a fuck way too much
I'ma need, like, two shots in my cup
Wanna get up, wanna get down
Mmh, that's how I feel right now
Oh, I've been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be, uh
Bitch, I might be better
Turn up the music, turn down the lights
I've got a feeling I'm gon' be alright
Okay (okay), alright
It's about damn time (time)
Turn up the music, let's celebrate (alright)
I've got a feeling I'm gon' be okay
Okay (okay), alright
It's about damn time (bitch!)
'Cause, uh, you know what time it is, uh
I'm coming out tonight
I'm coming out tonight (uh-huh)
I'm coming out tonight
I'm coming out tonight (ooh)
I'm coming out tonight
I'm coming out tonight
Okay (okay), alright (alright)
It's about damn time (ooh)
I'm coming out tonight (let's go)
I'm coming out tonight (coming out tonight)
I'm coming out tonight
I'm coming out tonight (ooh)
I'm coming out tonight
I'm coming out tonight (coming out tonight)
Okay (okay), alright
It's about damn time (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bitch
Yeah, yeah
It's about damn time
