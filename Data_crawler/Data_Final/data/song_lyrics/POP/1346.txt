Song Name: This Girl (Kungs Vs. Cookin' On 3 Burners)
Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change 'cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love
No other thing that's as precious to
No other, there's no other
Than a heart that feels and a heart that's true
Something that you got to know, this girl
Woah!
Take my hand
Or them over
Take my hand, you
Or-or them over
Take my hand, you
Or them over
Take my hand
Or them over
These presents don't really come for free
Your pay cheques don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love
You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over, win me over
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Something that you've got to know, this
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
It's a shame but I've got to go
Woah!
Take my hand
Or them over
Take my hand, you
Or-or them over
Take my hand, you
Or them over
Take my hand
Or them over
