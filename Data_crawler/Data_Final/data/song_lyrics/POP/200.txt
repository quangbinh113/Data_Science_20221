Song Name: Everytime
Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me
Everytime I try to fly I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I may have made it rain, babe
Please forgive me
But my weakness caused you pain
And this songs my sorry
Oohh
At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby
