Song Name: Hopeless Romantic
I do it to myself
Fabricate a dream, reaching for what I see
In everybody else
It's never what it seems
It seems like they're happier than me
Seems like they're where I wanna be
I've got the heart of a hopeless romantic
Can you imagine
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
I'm broken and manic
Can you imagine
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm)
When I think about it
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm)
It's like I'm lying to myself (myself, myself, myself)
And hopelessly romanticizing, I'm willing to compromise
We're staring at the stars (stars)
While standing on the moon, instead of in this room
Nothing's ever enough for me
I keep it buried underneath (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I've got the heart of a hopeless romantic
Can you imagine
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
I'm broken and manic
Can you imagine
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm)
When I think about it
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm)
Oh, can you imagine? (Can you imagine?)
Hopeless romantic, hopeless romantic
Can you imagine?
Hopeless romantic
I've got the heart of a hopeless romantic
Can you imagine
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
I'm broken and manic (broken and manic)
Can you imagine (can you imagine?)
Looking for love in somewhere it's not?
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm, drive me crazy)
When I think about it (oh, ooh, no, whoa)
It's enough to drive you crazy, crazy (mm-mm)
Hopeless romantic, hopeless romantic (mm-mm)
