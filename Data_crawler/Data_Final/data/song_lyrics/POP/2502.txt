Song Name: Lost Without You (with Dean Lewis)
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
(I'm a little lost without you)
I was falling apart
So caught in the dark
Now that you're gone I see it
You were lighting my way
But so much has changed
So where did you go?
Tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
Don't keep me waiting here all night
'Cause you were not ready
Ready for someone
Someone to stay right by your side
Oh, I don't want to let you go
I'm a little lost without you, a little lost without you
My darling, you are all I know
I'm a little lost without you, a little lost without you
Without you by my side
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
I'm a little lost without you
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
I'm a little lost without you
(Tell me you love me)
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
I'm a little lost without you
I lost count of the days
So lost in a haze
Wherever I go I feel you
You say you needed some time to
Go back and find you
How could I know?
Oh, tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
Don't keep me waiting here all night
'Cause you are not ready
Ready for someone
Someone to stay right by your side
Oh, I don't want to let you go
I'm a little lost without you, a little lost without you
My darling, you are all I know
I'm a little lost without you, a little lost without you
Without you by my side
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you, oh
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you, oh
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you
(Tell me you love me)
(I'm, I'm a little lost)
(I'm, I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you
Tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
(I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you
Tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
(I'm a little lost without you)
A little lost without you
Oh, I don't want to let you go
I'm a little lost without you, a little lost without you
