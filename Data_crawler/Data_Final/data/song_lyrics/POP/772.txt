Song Name: Silly Crush
I heard a car outside
I'm waiting by the door
No place left to hide
Love is just around the corner
Someone's on the phone
Don't know what to say
Tell them no one's home
And my cat has got my tongue
'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush
Saw you in the park
One lonely afternoon
Followed you till dark
But I ran out of chances
To tell you how I feel
Now that I'm in love
This time it's for real
But it's scaring me to death
'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush
Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say
I heard a car outside
I'm waiting by the door
No place left to hide
Love is just around the corner
Someone's on the phone
But what should I say
Tell her no one's home
The cat has got my tongue
'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush
Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say
Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say
Dreamin' how I'll get to you
