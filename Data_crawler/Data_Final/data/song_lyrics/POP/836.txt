Song Name: Chamber Of Reflection
Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day you're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone
No use looking out
It's within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear among the better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone
