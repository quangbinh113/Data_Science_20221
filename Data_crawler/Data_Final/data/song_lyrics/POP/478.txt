Song Name: Wings - Live from Spotify London
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And if they give you sh...
Then they can walk on by
My feet, feet can't touch the ground
And I can't hear a sound
But you just keep on running up your mouth, yeah
Walk, walk on over there
Because I'm too fly to care
Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
Because wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
I'm firing up on that runway
I know we're going to get there someday
But we don't need no ready steady go, no
Talk, talk turns into air
And I don't even care, oh yeah
Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
Because wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
I don't need no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey
I don't hear no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey
You'd better keep on walking
I don't want to hear your talking, boy'd
You'd better keep on walking
I don't want to hear your talking, boy'd
Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
They're just like water off my wings
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
Because wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
