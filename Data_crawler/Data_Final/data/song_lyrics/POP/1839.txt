Song Name: Feels (feat. Khalid)
It feels like I'm running
Far away, every day
I still wanna move in
Trying hard to find a way back
Who are these people
With their ears to the ground?
And I see that they're talking
But I can't hear a sound
I can't fight this feeling
And I don't want to change
Swear I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
Tell everyone I'm leaving
'Cause I don't want to stay
Well, I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
It's driving me insane
Driving me insane
I stand in the corner
The walls around are falling down
And I see that you notice
But keep your words all to yourself, now
We're all different people
But we're together now
I know that we're equal
Let's try to work this out
I can't fight this feeling
And I don't want to change
Yeah, I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
Tell everyone I'm leaving
'Cause I don't want to stay
Yeah, I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
And I wonder if I'll ever get away now, away now
Got me dreaming of the changes that we'll make now
Well, I can't fight this feeling
And I don't want to change
Well, I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
Tell everyone I'm leaving
'Cause I don't want to stay
But I can't fight this feeling
It's driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
