Song Name: Tapestry
Life has just begun
No turning back from now
When i open my eyes
I see the good things in life
It's a tapestry
I know you won't do bad to me
It's a mystery
To where our life leads us to be
Now you're here with me
It's a tapestry
If it's meant to be
My life becomes a dream
If it's not meant to be
That's where life leads us to be
It's a tapestry
I know you won't do bad to me
It's a mystery
To where our life leads us to be
Now you're here with me
It's a tapestry
It's a tapestry
I know you won't do bad to me
It's a mystery
To where our life leads us to be
Now you're here with me
It's a tapestry
Now you're here with me
It's a tapestry
