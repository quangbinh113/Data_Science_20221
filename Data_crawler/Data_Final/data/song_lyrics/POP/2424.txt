Song Name: Fumbled the Bag
I saw you out with your friends
Same old cologne on your skin
You said, "I miss you" and "how you been?"
You know I'm no good at this
My stomach's doing front flips
I used to know you, it makes me sick
So don't call me overdramatic
Pretending the story of us isn't tragic
What if the best thing you had is somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walked away
You wish you'd turned around?
What if you got it all wrong and I was the one all along?
Hate to say, "I told you so" but baby ain't it sad
You fumbled the bag
You said your sister's engaged
She found love, you can't say the same
Thought that would be us one day
Small talk is hard to maintain, when my heart's in 2019
You stood close and I just looked away
So don't call me overdramatic
Pretending the story of us isn't tragic
What if the bеst thing you had is somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walkеd away
You wish you'd turned around?
What if you got it all wrong and I was the one all along?
Hate to say, "I told you so" but baby ain't it sad
Oh-oh-oh-oh, now you gotta watch me
Give the world to someone else
You're throwing matches on the flame
But you're the one who burned it out when you left
I should've said
What if the best thing you had is somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walked away
You wish you'd turned around?
What if you got it all wrong and I was the one all along?
Hate to say, "I told you so" but baby ain't it sad
You fumbled the bag
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
You fumbled the bag
