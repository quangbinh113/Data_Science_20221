Song Name: Movie Star
How did it happen, how did it happen?
I didn't feel it
How things got so complicated, I didn't feel it
Now I know why, I must be kind
I must be someone terribly useful
Am I trying too hard
Or is it never good enough
Think I'd just let it be
I just keep going
Think I'd just let it be
God knows I'd do it one more time
Think I'd just let it be
I just keep going
Think I'd just let it be
To get it over
Walked along the path
And gone a bit far
But I'll never be too lonely
And have you as a company
Living like a movie and we're the movie stars
The story keeps going
Been unreal
Think I'd just let it be
I just keep going
Think I'd just let it be
God knows I'd do it one more time
Think I'd just let it be
I just keep going
Think I'd just let it be
To get it over
