Song Name: Line by Line
Let's take a walk 'cause we're not getting any sleep tonight
Down by the water where they're hanging up those strings of lights
Let's go off the script
Scrap the final page
I don't know why we read them, man
They're all the same
Let tomorrow wait
Let's take a little time
Don't worry about the daylight
Just keep on talking
Line by line
'Cause I don't want to say goodbye
Close your eyes and keep on talking
Line by line
'Till we get to the other side
Close your eyes, we're only talking
My head's not set for getting through another opening night
Those questions I don't want to deal with at the best of times
Let's go off the script
Scrap the final page
I don't know why we bother, man
They're all the same
Let tomorrow wait
Let's take a little time
Don't worry about the daylight
Just keep on talking
Line by line
'Cause I don't want to say goodbye
Close your eyes and keep on talking
Line by line
'Till we get to the other side
Close your eyes, we're only talking
Line by line
Night by night
Those little boats are turning out their lights
Line by line
Night by night
Just close your eyes and keep on talking
Line by line
Line by line
Cause I don't want to say goodbye
It's too late to change the ending
Too late to change the ending
