Song Name: You and I
I wanna feel something
I wanna feel something
I drink to feel to something
I sleep and feel nothing
Maybe that's where you come in
Maybe that's where you and I begin
I want some good loving
I want some good loving
Want it to mean something
Set this old heart buzzing
Maybe that's where you come in
Maybe that's where you and I begin
No, I don't need a heavenly home
A place beyond the clouds with everyone we've ever known
It don't matter where we go
If you were born to run
I was made to run with you
I was made for you
I need some church, darling
I need some church, darling
I am a false prophet
I must confess, darling
Maybe that's where you come in
Maybe that's where you and I begin
Our love's a great mountain
Our love's a great mountain
Climbed up and fell down it
We lived to laugh about it
Well, baby you and I survived
Maybe God thanks you that I'm alive
No, I don't need a heavenly home
A place beyond the clouds with everyone we've ever known
It don't matter where we go
If you were born to run
I was made to run with you
I was made for you
I was made for you
You
I wanna feel something
I want some good loving
Take me to church darling
Our love's a great mountain
Baby, after all this time
Maybe home is you and I've arrived
