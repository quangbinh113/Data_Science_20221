Song Name: Astronomy
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch

We joked as we looked that they were too good for us
'Cause socially speaking, we were the same
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank
A tale old as time, young love don't last for life
And now I know, now I know
It's time to go, it's time to go
We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart

(It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart
From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you
But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew
I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love
You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us
The only mistake that we didn't make was run
(Now look what we've done)
We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart
Stop trying to keep us alive
You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died
Stop trying to keep us alive
You can't force the stars to align when they've already died
Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh
Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
