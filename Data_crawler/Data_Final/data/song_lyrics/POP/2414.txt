Song Name: Goodnight
All alone is how I end up again
Whenever I think I find love again
There it goes
It's a shame that you and that heart of yours
Took your time, build it all up and just
Let it fade
Darlin', I've been waiting so long
Just to hear you say you're coming home
When you're not here, this bed gets so cold
So let me fall asleep before you go
When I close my eyes
Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
'Cause we know goodbye's the end
What's the use of crying these tears again?
When you don't mind letting me drown in them like a fool (Ah, ah)
It's a shame that you and that heart of yours
Took your time, build it all up and just
Let it fade (Ah, ah, ah)
Darlin', I've been waiting so long
Just to hear you say you're coming home
You're not here, this bed gets so cold
So let me fall asleep before you go
When I close my eyes
Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
'Cause we know goodbye's the end
('Cause we know goodbye's the end)
('Cause we know goodbye's the end)
('Cause we know goodbye's the end)
('Cause we know goodbye's the end)
