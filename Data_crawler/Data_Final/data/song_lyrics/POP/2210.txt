Song Name: Steal My Girl
She's been my queen since we were 16
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams
Alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son
Alright, alright
I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Oh, yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Alright)
Na, na, na, na, na-na
Na, na
She belongs to me
Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans
Alright, alright
I don't exist if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn
Alright, alright
But I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Oh, yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Alright)
Na, na, na, na, na-na
Na, na, na, na, na-na
She knows, she knows
That I never let her down before
She knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me, now
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Wel find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Alright, yeah, alright)
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Yeah)
Na, na
She belongs to me
Na, na, na, na, na-na (She belongs to me, yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na-na (Alright)
Na, na, na, na, na-na
She belongs to me
