Song Name: Lights Are On
God stood me up
And I don't know why
Lights are on
But nobody's home

There ain't no love like our love

There ain't no love like our love
Like our love, love, love, love, love
Let the last worms go
And roll in tonight
Don't wake us up
We got nothing for you
There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
Like our love, love, love, love, love

Build us a door
And rest here with me
Lights are on
But nobody's home

There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
