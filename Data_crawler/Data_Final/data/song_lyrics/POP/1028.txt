Song Name: The Finger (feat. Georgia Ku)
Hit me where it hurts the most
Throw your stones
You'll be looking at the finger
Stick it where the sun don't shine
I got no time
I'll be starin' in the mirror
You're a neat freak
You stay within the lines
And I'm a cannonball
A rebel of the times
Eyes on my body, I'm calling the shots
You say you don't want me
I'm already gone
Hit me where it hurts the most
Throw your stones
You'll be looking at the finger
Stick it where the sun don't shine
I got no time
I'll be starin' in the mirror
'Cause I don't follow
I'm a fighter
Line up and we'll knock you down
A primadonna, I bring the drama
Stand up and I'll show you how
Hit me where it hurts the most
Throw your stones
You'll be looking at the finger
Stick it where the sun don't shine
I got no time
I'll be starin' in the mirror
'Cause I don't follow
I'm a fighter
Line up and we'll knock you down
A primadonna, I bring the drama
Stand up and I'll show you how
Like a phoenix
High above the flames, yeah (high above the flames)
Get your punches in (mm-mm)
I'm ready for your game
Scars on my body
Got a smile on my face
You think you can hurt me
You've just been replaced
Hit me where it hurts the most
Throw your stones
You'll be looking at the finger
Stick it where the sun don't shine
I got no time
I'll be starin' in the mirror
'Cause I don't follow
I'm a fighter
Line up and we'll knock you down
A primadonna, I bring the drama
Stand up and I'll show you how
Hit me where it hurts the most
Throw your stones
You'll be looking at the finger
Stick it where the sun don't shine
I got no time
I'll be starin' in the mirror
'Cause I don't follow
I'm a fighter
Line up and we'll knock you down
A primadonna, I bring the drama
Stand up and I'll show you how
