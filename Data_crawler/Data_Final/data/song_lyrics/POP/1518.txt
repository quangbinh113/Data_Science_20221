Song Name: Let It Die
Toxicity slippin' to my blood stream
I give too much, you suck the life out of me
I fill my cup to drink you into someone else
And I blame myself
And I had a dream that we were perfect for each other
So sick, drivin' through the suburbs
We're goin' further
And I hear a voice
And it says to me
When did you lose the light behind your eyes?
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' on to love for life
I think it's timе to let it die
(Let it diе, let it die)
(Let it die, let it die)
If you lose yourself (let it die)
You can walk away (let it die)
(I think it's time)
When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' on to love for life
I think it's time to let it die
Not high for this, your heart has reached its limit
A counterfeit and now the lights are dimmin'
I won't go back, spinnin' around under your spell
On a carousel, oh
I had a dream that we were a beautiful endeavour
Sunset driving through the suburbs
Oh, we go no further
Then I hear a voice (I hear a voice)
And it's askin' me (and it's askin' me, yeah)
When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (Oh, did you lose, behind your eyes?)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry (oh)
And you're holdin' on to love for life
I think it's time to let it die
(When you're holdin' on for life; let it die, let it die)
(When you're holdin' on for life; let it die, let it die)
If you lose yourself (let it die)
You can walk away (let it die)
Oh, you let it die, oh, you let it die
When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' on to love for life
I think it's time to let it die
