Song Name: SOS
Champagne showered down on my pain
Lights fade, running round in blind faith
Las Vegas surrounded by the last fakers
Alligators, they chew me up and spit me out
You know I've been burning out
I've been calling out for you
I've been calling out for you, yeah
SOS, save my soul
I've been drowning for too long
SOS, save my soul
You know, 'cause you know
You're gonna throw me a lifeline
Throw me your heart
I've been waiting a lifetime
Calling for an SOS to save my soul tonight
Propeller, spinning me away forever
Umbrella, shelter me from stormy weather
Lines severed, but I know you been looking out
But you can hear me calling out
It's you I'm forever in debt to
Never been the same since the day that I met you
Going down, can you come to my rescue?
SOS, save my soul
I've been drowning for too long
SOS, save my soul
You know, 'cause you know
You're gonna throw me a lifeline
Throw me your heart
I've been waiting a lifetime
Calling for an SOS to save my soul tonight
SOS
Yeah
Throw me a lifeline
Throw me your heart
I've been waiting a lifetime
Calling for an SOS to save my soul tonight
Ooh, it's you I'm forever in debt to
Never been the same since the day that I met you
Going down, can you come to my rescue?
I'm calling for an SOS, save my soul
I've been drowning for too long
SOS, save my soul
'Cause you know, you know
SOS, save my soul
I've been drowning for too long
SOS, save my soul
'Cause you know, you know
You're gonna throw me a lifeline
Throw me your heart
I've been waiting a lifetime
Calling for an SOS to save my soul tonight
Champagne showered down on my pain
SOS
Lights fade, running round in blind faith
(Throw me a lifeline)
Las Vegas surrounded by the last fakers
(Throw me your heart
I've been waiting a lifetime)
Alligators, they chew me up and spit me out
(Calling for an SOS to save my soul tonight)
