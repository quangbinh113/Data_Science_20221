Song Name: The Loneliest Time (feat. Rufus Wainwright)
I've had one of those bad dreams
Where we're standin' on your street
I quit smokin' those cigarettes
But I'm never gettin' over it
And you're lookin' right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
But our story, never finished it
'Cause our love, we never finished it
I'm comin' over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (loneliest time)
I'm thinkin' all through the night (all through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time
If you wanna try it
If you wanna try me
If you wanna try, love
If you leave the light on for me
If you wanna try it
If you wanna try it
If you wanna try, love
I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went runnin', but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette
Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save "Sorry" for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right
I'm comin' over tonight (over tonight)
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (loneliest time)
I'm thinkin' all through the night (all through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time
(If you wanna try it)
If you wanna try, love (if you wanna try me)
(If you wanna try, love)
If you wanna try me (if you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)
If you leave the light on for me (if you wanna try it)
I just need back into (if you wanna try, love)
I just need back into your life (if you leave the light on for me)
What happened was we reached the moon
But lost in space, I think we got there all too soon
But you know what? I'm comin' back for you, baby
I'm comin' back for you
And in the mornin'
Sun hits the water
Is this Nirvana?
And in the mornin'
Sun hits the water
Is this Nirvana?
And in the mornin'
Sun hits the water
Is this Nirvana?
