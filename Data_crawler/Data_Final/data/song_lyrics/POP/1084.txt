(Yo Sean, you fuckin' them up on this one)
Yeah, I been in my zone (Zone)
Ridin' with this pistol, nigga, this ain't what you want (Want)
I been with them killers, sippin' lean, this ain't Patron ('Tron)
I can drop a check right on your head and get you gone (Grrt)
Yeah, yeah

Ridin' with this pistol, nigga, this ain't what you want (Want)
I been with them killers, sippin' lean, this ain't Patron ('Tron)
I can drop a check right on your head and get you gone (Grrt)
Demons take your soul (Yeah), yeah, my bitches on go (Go)
For this Birkin bag, yeah, she gon' touch her toes (Toes)
We ain't never mad, gotta fly across the globe (Yeah)
That's just what that check do (Check do)
Once you get your bag up (Yeah), then they gon' respect you (Yeah)
I like her demeanor, yeah, I like my bitches meaner, uh
Can't even get them racks up, that's Venus and Serena
You see these diamonds clean up, ooh, my bitch drive a 2021
Boy, you actin' mad 'cause you drive a Kia
I'm in my bag, bag, bag, your racks sad today
Checks come in so fast today
I might mix the '42, I chase it with Lemonade
Outside with my niggas, we don't give a fuck
Keep a .40 in the Louis bag, I seen some demons I can't trust
Mm-hm, drugs all in my system that I trust
Mm-hm, I know that shit make my heartrate up
Mm-hm, McLaren 720, lift it up
Mm-hm, when I'm down, please don't call my phone
Yeah, yeah, I been in my zone (Zone)
Ridin' with this pistol, nigga, this ain't what you want (Want)
I been with them killers, sippin' lean, this ain't Patron ('Tron)
I can drop a check right on your head and get you gone (Grrt)
Demons take your soul (Yeah), yeah, my bitches on go (Go)
For this Birkin bag, yeah, she gon' touch her toes (Toes)
We ain't never mad, gotta fly across the globe (Yeah)
That's just what that check do (Check do)
Once you get your bag up (Yeah), then they gon' respect you (Yeah)
Ridin' dirty, sippin' dirty with that .30
I'm a big phoenix, I been working since a birdie
With a bad bitch, suck my dick like a slurpee
Bitch, I'm tired of the damn games, ain't no Kirby
Say you love me, but you so concerned in tryna hurt me
Tryna torture my heart, kill me slowly but surely
Bitch, I won't give in, Cartier my lens (Woo)
Live this life of sin, bitch, this Oomp's revenge
And lovin' that, baby, where you goin'? I need some of that
I just got a gig for five-hundred racks
That's enough to make a bitch sit and do jumpin' jacks
Told her Rey Mysterio, lil' bitch, I'ma jump on that
I been in my zone (Zone)
Ridin' with this pistol, nigga, this ain't what you want (Want)
I been with them killers, sippin' lean, this ain't Patron ('Tron)
I can drop a check right on your head and get you gone (Grrt)
Demons take your soul (Yeah), yeah, my bitches on go (Go)
For this Birkin bag, yeah, she gon' touch her toes (Toes)
We ain't never mad, gotta fly across the globe (Yeah)
That's just what that check do (Check do)
Once you get your bag up (Yeah), then they gon' respect you (Yeah)
