Song Name: Breakfast in Bed
I still want you
Let's run it back, one more time
Let's order breakfast in bed
Just me and you and Mister Sunshine
Let's order breakfast in bed
And leave the ordinary world behind
Last night was unexpected
Nothing we could have predicted
What happened for some time
You can blame it on the gin and lime
Let's run it back, rewind
Don't be in such a hurry
You don't have to worry
I'm finding all your clothes
Do not disturb is hanging from the door, so
Let's order breakfast in bed
Just me and you and Mister Sunshine
Let's order breakfast in bed
And leave the ordinary world behind
The moment that you wake up
Don't put on your make up
I want you exactly as you are
I know you got your battles and your scars
Let's settle down, recharge
Good morning California
Let the sunshine warm you
And the sparkles on your skin
And there enjoy each other one more again, and then
Let's order breakfast in bed
Just me and you and Mister Sunshine
Let's order breakfast in bed
And leave the ordinary world behind
Champagne, strawberry jam
I want you to know who I am
French toast, we'll do the most
I know it's got to end but until then
Let's order breakfast in bed
Just me and you and Mister Sunshine
Let's order breakfast in bed
And leave the ordinary world behind
Let's order breakfast in bed
(I still want you)
Let's order breakfast in bed
(Let's run it back, one more time)
