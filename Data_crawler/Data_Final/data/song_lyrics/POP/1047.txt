Song Name: Can I Get It
Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make it, if I can make your heart my home
Throw me to the water (water)
I don't care how deep or shallow (water)
Because my heart can pound like thunder (water)
And your love, and your love can set me free (water)
Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine, mine
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now? (Huh)
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

You tease me with your control (water)
Because I long to live under your spell (water)
And without your love, I'm hollow (water)
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own (water)
Oh, I have promised I will love you
'Til the end of time (the end of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine (so divine)
I will be the melody, the rhythm and your rhyme (mh-mh-mh)
All I want is for you to be mine, mine
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now? (Huh)
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?
When will you run with me?
Like I know you wanna (like you want to, like you want to)

You're the one for me
And I'm countin' on you (on you)
To put the pieces of me back together

So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Mm, mm)
Can I get it right now? (Uh)
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
