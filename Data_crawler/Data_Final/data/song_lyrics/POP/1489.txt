Song Name: Too Well
Today, I woke up in a good mood for once
The first time in six months, I don't hate you as much
You weren't there in my dreams, I could finally sleep
I felt good, but it sucks, I don't hate you as much
It's easier holding a grudge
I'd rather be angry than crushed
I'm doing too much (I do too much)
I'm back where I started again
Crying and calling my friends
This shit never ends
Ugh
I get so sick of myself
Can't stop overthinking
I heard you're happy somewhere else
But I don't forget too well
I get so sick of myself
Can't stop reminiscing
I heard you're happy somewhere else
But I don't forget too well
I still see your face, I hate hearing your name
What a wreck, what a shame, I'm replaying that day
And you called me at eight, two weeks on a break
Just to ask for more space, you're my biggest mistake
It's easier holding a grudge
I'd rather be angry than crushed
I'm doing too much (I do too much)
I'm back where I started again
Crying and calling my friends
This shit never ends
Ugh
I get so sick of myself
Can't stop overthinking
I heard you're happy somewhere else
But I don't forget too well
I get so sick of myself
Can't stop reminiscing
I heard you're happy somewhere else
But I don't forget too well
I get so sick of myself
Can't stop overthinking
I heard you're happy somewhere else
But I don't forget too well
