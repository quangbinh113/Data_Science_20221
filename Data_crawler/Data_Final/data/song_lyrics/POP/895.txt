Song Name: Catch Me (I'm Falling)
I am descending from heaven above
So catch me, I'm falling
Hold on to my love, ooh, oh-oh
Are you ready, boy?
Here I come, catch me, I'm falling
You came into my life
The look in your eyes took me by surprise
It's you and nobody else
The love that's made me so blind I can't see
I am descending from heaven above
So catch me, I'm falling, baby
Hold on to my love
Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Falling in love
Two hearts, beating in time
The rhythm as one, I am yours, you are mine
For you, I surrender myself
Each night, everyday, always feeling this way
Falling in motion as though I had wings
With your sweet love and devotion
Baby, it's magic, a magical thing
Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling (Oh, woah-woah-oh)
Catch me I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Falling in love
(Ooh, catch me)
(Boy, boy)
(Boy, boy, boy, boy...)
I am descending from heaven above
So catch me, I'm falling
Hold on to my love
Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling (Babe)
Ooh, catch me, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Catch me now, I'm falling
Falling in love
Ooh, I'm falling
Ooh, I'm falling
Ooh, I'm falling (Yeah, I'm falling in love)
Ooh, I'm falling
Ooh, I'm falling
Ooh, I'm falling
Ooh, I'm falling
