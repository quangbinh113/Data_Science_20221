Song Name: Apologetic Dancer
I feel emotional
I say I've seen the things I need see
My bursts of rage can go a hundred feet
The same old record just goes on repeat
There he goes trying to start again
"On the way" you know he's still in bed
You don't know why you're still bothering
Oftentimes, I'm stuck here wondering
Ah, the boy used to be so pristine
And from a perfect slate
Yesterday's such a dream
Ah, the man who likes sing his song
Now it's just way too late
Yesterday's far too long
I feel it take its toll
I bear the weight of inconsistency
Stuck in a cage, we're in a different league
We're on our own as far as I believe
It's been a long time coming, as you've figured out
Just play the fool, say sorry, and don't ever doubt
You're alone so run your race
Stay home and save some face
Only time can tell the pace
Let's keep dancing in disgrace
Ah, the boy used to be so pristine
And from a perfect slate
Yesterday's such a dream
Ah, the man who likes sing his song
Now it's just way too late
Yesterday's far too long
It's just so hard to the draw the line
Wish I could just enjoy the ride
That classic "boy you've lost your mind"
That's what they tell me all the time
Ah, the boy used to be so pristine
And from a perfect slate
Yesterday's such a dream
Ah, the man who likes sing his song
Now it's just way too late
Yesterday's far too long
Ah, the shine exceeds his legacy
You find him falling short
As long as I can see
Ah, the man who likes sing his song
Now it's just way too late
Yesterday's far too long
