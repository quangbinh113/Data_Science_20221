Song Name: GROWING UP IS _____
Heard you moved out of town on the weekend
Understand, but I'm sad that you're leaving
Are you up making friends with the ceiling
Yeah, I know the feeling
I wasn't tryin' to let you down
I was just working my shit out
I'm sorry I didn't know how much I led you on
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends
Break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
No regrets, no mistakes
Growin' up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growing up is...
Get emotional at two in the morning
It's a habit, know I shouldn't be callin'
Then you let me in
Is that what you wanted
Is this what we wanted
Now you're back in town
No I can't come around
Are we better without the what-ifs and doubts?
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget
And try again?
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
No regrets, no mistakes
Growin' up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is...
Wish that you were here (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Wish that you were here)
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
No regrets, no mistakes
Growin' up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is weird
Oh, yeah, yeah, hey
Oh-oh, then I just disappear
Ooh-ooh, I just disappear
Wish that you were here
Growing up is...
