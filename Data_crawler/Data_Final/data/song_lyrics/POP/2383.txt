Song Name: A Little Bit Yours
You found someone new before me
And you didn't try nearly as hard
And maybe that's the problem
I don't know how to take it away from you
Without giving someone else my heart
All I do is get over you
And I'm still so bad at it
I let myself want you
I let myself try
I let myself fall back into your eyes
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't
You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours
Maybe if I'd said the right things
It never would've gone this way
But maybe that's the problem
'Cause I still kinda think it was up to me
When I never could've made you stay
All I do is get over you
And I'm still so bad at it
I let myself want you
I let myself try
I let myself fall back into your eyes
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't
You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours
You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours
All I do is get over you
And I'm still so bad at it
We outgrew the love we knew
But I still wish I had it
I let myself want you
I let myself try (I let myself try)
I let myself fall back into your eyes (I fall back into your eyes)
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
You're not mine anymore (anymore, anymore, anymore)
But I'm still a little bit yours (little bit, little bit, little bit yours)
You're not mine anymore (anymore, anymore, anymore)
And I'm still a little bit yours
