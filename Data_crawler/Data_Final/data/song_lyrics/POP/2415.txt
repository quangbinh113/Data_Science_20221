Song Name: Always Love
It's kinda hard waking up in the morning without you
When I reach over and realize it's over
I just let the memories wash over me, through me, and out of me
But they're still on the sheets and they stay there
So I lay there with you
Even though we didn't work
It's always love, always love
And even though we hurt each other more than once
It was love, always love
For all those times that we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love, always love
Nobody talks about walking away when there's still love
Feeling so far after being so close is a mindfuck
You helped me grow into me so I couldn't help but change
But changing meant seeing some things that
I just couldn't change
And even though we didn't work
It's always love, always love
And even though we hurt each other more than once
It was love, always love
For all those times that we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love, always love
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Even though we didn't work
It's always love, always love
Even though we hurt each other more than once
It's always love
All those times that we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love, oh, it's always love
It's always love, always love
