Song Name: Short Stay
A second, a minute, an hour, a day
A week, a month, a year, a decade
A second, a minute, an hour, a day
A week, a month, a year, a decade
Wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
Be safe
Take care
A good day
A bad day
A bad day, a bad day, you better take good care
A second, a minute, an hour, a day
A week, a month, a year, a decade
A second, a minute, an hour, a day
A week, a month, a year, a decade
Come over a thousand miles and let me see you try
'Cause I'd be the one you like that we could spend the nighttime
Come over a thousand miles and let me see you try
'Cause I'd be the one you like that we could spend the nighttime
