Song Name: Stay for the Night
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Sometimes I wish
I had a time machine
So I could see
Where we could be
How could I
Have been so blind
Come take a ride
It's worth a try
We feel alright
Could you stay for the night
I promise you darling
I will hold you tight
I would never let you go
I would keep you by my side
So baby please
Could you stay for the
For the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
The night is young
And so are we
Lets just escape
From reality
Take my hand
It's worth a try
Oh baby please
Would you stay for the
For the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
We feel alright
Could you stay for the night
I promise you darling
I will hold you tight
I would never let you go
I would keep you by my side
So baby please
Could you stay
For the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
Stay for the night
Stay for the na, ah, ight
