Song Name: Renee
All the words I had to say
They don't mean nothing to you
What the hell, we're on the way
There is no nothing better
All we had to do was touch
That was the best chance
I could have ever... and all of us
All day long we looked to fall
Looking into the sun
And found a way to get along
To be waiting for you
In the day, oh, in the day
There's nights between us
Looking for another way
All the words I said were wrong
They don't mean nothing to you
All we had to do was touch
And there's no nothing better
In the day, oh, in the day
I've been reaching for you
Nights between us all the way
All the way
You've got it, it took so long to bear

It's all the way
You got it, it took so long to bear
And we've been waiting for it
All the words I said were wrong
They don't mean nothing to you
All we had to do was touch
And there's no nothing better
What the hell are beds for, man?
They go waiting for you
Waste away, don't find the time
It's all by your side
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
You got it!
Took too long to get it! (You got it)
