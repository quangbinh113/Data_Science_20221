Song Name: Very Few Friends
Listen
I'm not toxic, I'm broken baby
Or maybe I'm just saying that
Got a bad lil' ting
من المغرب تستني علي
She knows where I'm staying at
قلتلها تجيلي علي امريكا بس ما عندها فيزا
فقلتلها تلاقيني بمرسيليا
Vas y fais tes valises et retrouve moi dans le sud de la France
و الفريق حولية
'Cause uh
Lover Boy Levant back in the building
Viens chez moi vas y we - till the morning
Demain soir on va tester ça
Après ça sera la dernière fois 'cause
Gotta focus on the vision baby
Next year I'll be on FIFA
Ah t'as kiffé that I'm driven baby?
Well the thing is
I have very few friends
I'm focused and have very few friends
Self respect with some green eyes and that sun tan
(يا عيني عليكي)
Self made
Now you're self paid with your own plans
(يلا مر علي بيتي)
Your family was so proud of you
لما تركت البلاد بيبي
سلمي علي سيدو
و سلمي علي تيتا
و سلمي علي جاد اخوكي
We have designer sex in the morning
Expensive when you're moaning
Hop on a zoom call for an hour
Then come back to show you who own it
Fly you to Beirut for the wintertime
Don't post about it online (okay)
Took her to dinner in Hamra
And one thing she kept telling me
She has very few friends
She's focused and has very few friends
فقلتلها
You take away all my focus
But I'm down
Gotta bring you back to my town
طيارة دغري علي بلادي
و اكيد
I'll show you around
Bienvenue dans mon quartier
Sur son bracelet c'est du Cartier
Elle veux que je lui parle en français
I wanna take you to Paris and spoil you
I wanna go to Marseille and enjoy you
I want those guys in your DMs to talk to themselves
And then tell all their friends that they know you
I wanna make you forget about your ex
I want you overthinking all your texts
I want the neighbors to hear you yell
Told me she's a CEO I can tell
So you do you
And I'll do me
But when we come together it's
When we come together it's a fucking problem
