Song Name: Gilded Lily
Now it's been long enough to talk about it
I've started not to doubt it, just wrap my head around it
I remember when you told me it's an everyday decision
But with my double vision, how was I supposed to see the way?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between walls
Every city's got a graveyard
The service bought and paid for
Now I'm sleeping in the backyard
Passing out as light turns into day
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between walls
Go and stretch out my arms
Long as they need to be
Turn off all alarms and lie to me
Go and stretch out my arms
Long as they need to be
Turn off all alarms and lie to me
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
I know I'll take you with me
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between walls
