Song Name: Let's Love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love
I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
Count on me if you feel any pain
Talk to me I'll run to you again
You can count on me, and I can count on you
You show up, like I show up
And I'll keep showing up for you
So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
We'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
I swear you're safe, this too shall pass
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love
I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
You can count on me, oh, and I can count on you
You show up for me, I show up for you
And I'll keep showing up for you
So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
We'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
I swear you're safe, this too shall pass
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
We'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
