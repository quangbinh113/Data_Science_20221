Song Name: Way Back Home
(Your way back home)
Darker days, a hurricane
Start a fire, then you're off again
It got cold, lose and gain
Run in circles, tryna find your way
Longer nights, losing sleep
You're on the line but you never speak
Just drift away into the deep
Into the deep
I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And baby, I want you to know
I'll always be (I'll always be)
I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home
Your way back home
Moving on makes it worse
To find someone you gotta lose them first
I won't call after search
Bring you back into my universe
Chasing you, I can't keep
Justifying every time you lеave
Drift away into the deep
Into the deep
I can hеar your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
But baby, I want you to know
I'll always be (I'll always be)
I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home
Your way back home
I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home
