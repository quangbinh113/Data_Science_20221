Song Name: lonely christmas (feat. Justin Bieber & Poo Bear)
Right now, I'd be out there shoppin'
Some of you call it trickin' off
The money never meant nothin'
To see you smile, you know that I'd blow it all
We used to get our lights from Walmart
And hang 'em up for the whole world to see, yeah
Reminiscin' on your milk and cookies
I'm missin' you and me
It's gonna be lonely Christmas
A lonely broken-hearted Christmas
No mistletoes, no givin' kisses
It's gonna be a lonely Christmas, yeah, yeah
Stressin' 'bout impressin' all your family
'Cause everybody knows I've been workin' hard
Your mama beggin' me to bring over some food
Remember her spillin' gravy in my car (ayy)
It was almost like every holiday
Could never ever outdo the last
And even though it ain't snowin' in the desert, girl
Still the coldest winter I've ever had
It's gonna be lonely Christmas
A lonely broken-hearted Christmas
I feel the heart of a resentment
It's gonna be a lonely Christmas, yeah, yeah
No candles lit for Hanukkah
Oh, I might as well be a Jehovah's witness
Now I know the meanin' of a silent night
On my own, ayy
It's gonna be lonely Christmas
A lonely broken-hearted Christmas
Don't give a - about a wishlist
It's gonna be a lonely Christmas, yeah
And I'm like, "Woah-ho-ho-ho-oh"
Talkin' 'bout, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Woah-ho-ho-ho-oh
Talkin' 'bout, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
A lonely night
A lonely Christmas (yeah)
Hey, yeah, it's gonna be a lonely Christmas
Oh, no, no, no
Woah-ooh, no, no, no
