Song Name: True Love
True love shouldn't be this complicated
I thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your-
True love shouldn't be this complicated
I thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your-
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder
Wait, when you see the kids? I'll see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when the sun set? I see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when I pick 'em up, I feel like they borrowed
When I gotta return them, scan 'em like a barcode
Wait, no hard feelings, but these feelings hard though
Wait, who got the kids in those "What are those?"
Wait, why they can't wear Yeezys with the cargos?
Y'all know Nike don't like me, y'all take it too far, though
At least have 'em in some Mike's, he played for Chicago
I only see three kids, who watchin' Chicago?
And you know all the nannies they're Danny Nesbrasco
Let the kids dig a tunnel to my house like Chapo
Only neighbor in the hood with a door they can knock on
I leave the light on
True love (daddy's not gone)
Shouldn't be this complicated (you see the light on)
I thought I'd die in your arms (daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your- (tell Gekyume)
True love (daddy's not gone)
Shouldn't be this complicated (tell Gekyume)
I thought I'd die in your arms (daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your-
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa (love)
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder

True love shouldn't be this complicated
I thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your-
True love shouldn't be this complicated
I thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your-
