Song Name: Buttons
Hey, I fell in love with you
I don't know where I am
You're runnin' through my mind and then you show me love
In my room, in my room
Hey, you went away to save yourself from all the rain
And then I picked you up, and then I showed you love
And then we talked
Let our guards down (down, down)
I say, "You, you took me all around
Then treat me like a dog and make me walk for miles
And then you held me up"
I will never not love you, not love you, uh
About my pride, about my pride, about my pride
About my prize (there's something 'bout my pride)
About my prize (there's something 'bout my loving)
About my pride (there's something 'bout my pride)
About my pride (there's something 'bout my loving)
About my pride, oh yeah, oh
