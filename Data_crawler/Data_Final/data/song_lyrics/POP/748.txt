Song Name: Catflap
I guess you've changed your mind again
At least we could still be friends but
Don't let me down
Darling don't let me down 'cause I might lose my way
So many things I don't care enough
Too many things I care in preceding amounts
Sums up how I feel about myself
Shakin' off all the bad thoughts that come with you
How did the echoes in my head get so out of tune?
What are your fences up against?
Our castles have turned into sand but
Don't let me down
Don't let me down 'cause I've lost my way
How many blunders does it take
For the sake of yourself to finally admit your mistake
I guess you just don't seem to roll that way
I see you clinging tightly to the strap
And we're still holding hands through a catflap
Does it not make you question the times you've lost yourself
Trust me it's more than many, I'm not trying to be petty but
I'm still
Shakin' off all the bad thoughts that come with you
How did the echoes in my head get so out of tune?
Shakin' off all the bad thoughts that come with you
How did the echoes in my head get so out of tune?
I see you clinging tightly to the strap
And we're still holding hands through a catflap
