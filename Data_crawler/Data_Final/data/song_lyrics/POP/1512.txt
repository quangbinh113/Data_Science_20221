Song Name: Something in the Orange
It'll be fine by dusk that I'm telling you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
To you, I'm just a man
To me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
'Cause orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
To you, I'm just a man
To me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
To you, I'm just a man
To me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around
