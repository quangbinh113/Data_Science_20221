Song Name: Angel Disco Love
Angel disco love
Don't wanna stop, keep me on and on
Rising
The night has just begun
Bird wings of love
Fly me to the top of the morning sun
Shining
My treasure won't be gone
Angel lover
She's under cover
Like late night fever
No way for me to run
Angel Lover
She makes me wonder
How much I need her
My fate cannot be wrong
I'm gone for your smile
In your love, I'm in exile
The garden could be mine
So I run to your eyes
From my love, we fly
Back to Eden one more time
Angel lover
She's undercover
Like late night fever
Nowhere for me to run
Angel Lover
She makes me wonder
How much I need her
My fate cannot be wrong
I'm gone for your smile
Paradise of love, I'm in exile
The garden could be mine
So I run to your eyes
Without your love, I'm barely blind
Take me to heaven one last time
Angel disco love
I want you in my arms
When the lights fading out tonight
The pleasure just begun
Angel disco love
I need you in my heart
When the stars shining bright, hold tight
Adventures will be fun
Angel disco love
Don't wanna stop, keep me on and on
Rising
The night has just begun
Bird wings of love
Fly me to the top of the morning sun
Shining
My treasure won't be gone
Angel disco love
Don't wanna stop, you're my only star
Rising
Don't keep me hanging on
Bird wings of love
Fly me to the top of the morning sun
Shining
Come back into my heart
