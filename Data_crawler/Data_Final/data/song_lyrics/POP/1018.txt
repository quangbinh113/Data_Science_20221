Song Name: Just A Cloud Away
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away-way-way-way-way-way
Way-way-way-way-way-way
Hey, baby, so what? You blown a fuse (you blown a fuse)
Well, that happens to us all (that happens to us all)
Well, I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (change), change (change), change (change), change (change)
We've all, of course, been there before
Been there crying, fighting the dark
Let good energy be your strong
Won't get away-way-way-way
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away-way-way-way-way-way
Way-way-way-way-way-way
Hey, baby
Well, today the rock star (today the rock star)
Feels like singing the blues (feels like singing the blues)
Don't abandon that song (don't abandon that song)
'Cause the tune could change (change), change (change), change (change)
Change (change)
We've all, of course, been there before
Been there crying, fighting the dark
Gravity doesn't mean the earth's
Your ball and chain (chain), chain (chain), chain (chain), chain (chain)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away-way-way-way-way-way
Way-way-way-way-way-way
Everything is cyclical
What goes around does come back around, baby
Everything boomerangs
What goes up must come down
Love is warm, winter's cold
Humility will keep your feet on the ground
So do your thing through the rain
If you understand, won't you sing with me now?
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away-way-way-way-way-way
Way-way-way-way-way-way
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away-way-way-way-way-way
Way-way-way-way-way-way
