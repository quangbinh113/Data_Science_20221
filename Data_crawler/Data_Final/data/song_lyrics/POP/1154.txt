Song Name: You Right
(Gotta let him know)
I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just—
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you right
You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Say, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Boy, you can take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to be
I can't tell no one but they all know
I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just—
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you right
You right, I got my guy (you right)
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Say, you right, I got my guy (you right)
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy when you're on top of me (oh yeah)
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate 'cause you chose loyalty (oh yeah)
I know your history, met him before your peak
He's so connected to the woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you (oh)
And it's just nerves, it's just—
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you (yuh, yuh, yuh)
And you right
You right, I got my guy (you right)
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Say, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
(Gotta let him know)
