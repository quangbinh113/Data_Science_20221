Song Name: Love Tonight - Edit
When you're tired
When you're lonely
You can just reach out an arm
Know I'll be there
I'll help you weather the storm

Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone
All I need is your love tonight

All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight (it's all I need)
All I need is your love tonight (tonight, oh)
In that moment
When you're feeling
Like there is nothing at all
Reach out to me
Know that I'll answer the call

Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone
All I need is your love tonight

All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
