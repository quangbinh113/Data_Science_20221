Song Name: YouYouYou
I'm in love with someone new
Still, I'm dreaming about you
All the phases in my life
Have your name etched with a knife
See the velvet in the sky
Setting softly in the night?
Fingertips run down my spine
I know everything is right
But it's you, you, you on my mind
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind, it's
You, you, you on my mind (mind), oh
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind
When my heart is turning blue (hey-yeah)
Got someone to change my mood (hey-yeah)
And there's nothing we won't do (hey-yeah)
But when we kiss, I think of you (hey-yeah)
If I saw your face, I'd have a heart attack
I'm not tryna say that I want you back
Lying awake, thinking everything is fine (fine)
When I'm without you, I don't feel complete (oh)
'Cause anyone can come and sweep me off my feet, but
It's you, you, you on my mind
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind, it's
You, you, you on my mind (mind), oh
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind
Heart attack
Want you back (you, you, you on my mind)
(You, you, you on my mind)
Feel complete
Off my feet (you, you, you on my mind)
(You, you, you on my mind)
But it's you, you, you on my mind
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind, it's
You, you, you on my mind (you are on my mind), oh
You, you, you on my mind (mind)
You, you, you on my mind
