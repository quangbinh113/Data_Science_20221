Song Name: Sacrifice
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
Uh, every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but
I sacrifice (sacrifice)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down)
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
I hold you through the toughest parts
When you feel like it's the end
'Cause life is still worth living
Yeah, this life is still worth living
I can break you down and pick you up
And fuck like we are friends
But don't be catching feelings
Don't be out here catching feelings 'cause
I sacrifice (sacrifice)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down, down, down)
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love (oh) I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
Oh, baby
I hope you know that I, I tried
Oh, baby (baby)
I hope you know I love my time, oh
I don't wanna sacrifice
I don't wanna, I try (hey)
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
