Song Name: Malibu
I never came to the beach
Or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore
Under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here
And I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free
As birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky's more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down
As we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life
Just standing here talking
You would explain the current
As I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same
And nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am
Next to you
The sky's so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true
In Malibu
