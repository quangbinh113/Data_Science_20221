Song Name: WTF
Sometimes I got a hard time seeing the point to existing
Am I here for a reason or 'cause my parents were drinking?
Sometimes I got a hard time, hard time believing in Jesus
If there's a Heaven above us then why can nobody see it?
Same shit, different year
'Til I disappear
What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Sometimes I got a hard time seeing the good in the chaos
If there's a meaning to my life then why the hell am I so lost?
Sometimes I got a hard time believing dreams are worth chasin'
When there's a 99 percent
Chance that I probably won't make it
Same shit different year

'Til I disappear
What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear
What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Sometimes I got a hard time
Am I the only one losing my mind?
What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear
What the fuck am I doing here?
(Same shit different year)
What the fuck am I doing here?
('Til I disappear)
Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear
What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
