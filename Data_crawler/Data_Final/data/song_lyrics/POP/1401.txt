Song Name: Floating
Uh-eh
Bridgetown, yeah
Floatin', got my weed crushed up, and I'm rollin'
Look up 'cause I'm floatin', babe
Outer space, don't know where I'm goin'
'Cause I decided this place don't know me like the stars do
That I decided, baby, this place don't know me like the stars do
That's right, they don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down, comin' down, babe
They don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down, comin' down, babe
Floatin', I got my weed crushed up and I'm rollin', eh
Look up 'cause I'm floatin', babe
Outer space, don't know where I'm goin' (don't know where I'm goin')
'Cause I know I'll find happiness somewhere (hm)
I can take you flyin' up in the air, I won't let you fall
Jump on, and baby, don't be scared (oh yeah)
Let me take you flyin' up in the air, no I won't let you fall
They don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down (comin' down), comin' down (comin' down), babe
They don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down (comin' down), comin' down (comin' down), babe
They don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down (comin' down), comin' down (comin' down), babe
They don't love me, I know, one more spliff and I'll go
And I ain't comin' down (comin' down), comin' down (comin' down), babe
Floatin', comin' down for no one
Spend my life on the run, flyin' close to the sun, yeah
You don't have to go, but I want you to know
I'll be waitin' for you (I'll be waitin' for you)
I'll be waitin' for you
I'll be waitin' for-, I'll be waitin' for you
