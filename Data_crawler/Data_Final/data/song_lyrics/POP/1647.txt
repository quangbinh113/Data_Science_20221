Song Name: Runaway Train (2022 Remaster)
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
I was a key that could use a little turnin'
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise, I couldn't keep
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep, there's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray
Runaway train, never goin' back
Wrong way, on a one way track
Seems like I should be gettin' somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on Earth did I get so jaded
Life's history seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just a drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train
And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it
Runaway train, never goin' back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
A little out of touch, little insane
Just easier than dealin' with the pain
Runaway train, never goin' back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train, tearin' up the track
Runaway train, burnin' in my veins
I run away, but it always seems the same
