Song Name: High
Whoa, oh
So far, so good
Mmm, oh, yep
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Tell me that you're gonna change, then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends
I can't make you love me, but at least you could pretend
Scripts gon' lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head
You play the same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls
When it's half past one and you're halfway drunk
You say you love me and it sounds so dumb
But you're the only one I can't run away from
The same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why you only say you love me when you're high?
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

(You only say you love me when you're... it never does)

You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
