Song Name: Blast Off
Clouds are blowin', don't know where we goin'
But we're levitatin' up in this room
(Ah-ha-ha) all these colors just like rainbows in summer
Got us smilin' like our dreams just came true (yeah)
I took a little somethin' to get here, yeah, yeah
I got a little bar if you ready, we can have it all
Oh, let's tip-toe to a magical place
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight (ooh)
And watch the world go crazy from outer space (ah-ah)
Blast off into the sky
As we're flyin', stars are multiplyin'
We're up so high, we'd be fools to look down (turn me down)
Shapes turn pacely, this is so amazin'
Destination pure, sensation, startin' the night (woo)
I took a little somethin' to get here, yeah, yeah
I got a little bar if you ready, we can have it all
Oh, let's tip-toe to a magical place
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight
And watch the world go crazy from outer space
Blast off into the sky
Into the sky
Into the sky, into the sky
Dance all night on Saturn's ring
If you got some friends that you wanna bring, then come on
It's time to take this party up and beyond
Let's tip-toe to a magical place (come fly with me)
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight (the moon and the stars above)
And watch the world go crazy from outer space
Blast off (woo) into the sky
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh-yeah)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh-yeah)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh-yeah) woo!
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh-yeah) come on
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh-yeah)
All the way from the stratosphere
Sendin' love from up above
Happy trails, Baba
