Song Name: Never Let You Go
No I won't forget you
Won't forget you
Derulo
I can see it in your eyes
I'll only have you just for a time
I'll believe your every lie
Calling love a suicide
I fell for you, it only took a minute
Hoping that the moment never finished
We both know the truth
When you leave I'm trying to forget it
How am I supposed to go on living
Comparing everybody to you?
No, I won't forget you, won't forget you
No, I won't forget you, won't forget you
No, I won't forget you, won't forget you
I will never let you go
I won't forget about the—
I can't forget about the—
Diamonds falling down your face
Tell me who you're trying to replace
Cause it hurts so good to feel the space
And nights like this I can't erase
And I fell for you, it only took a minute
Hoping that the moment never finished
We both know the truth
When you leave I'm trying to forget it
How am I supposed to go on living
Comparing everybody to you?
No, I won't forget you, won't forget you
No, I won't forget you, won't forget you
No, I won't forget you (forget you), won't forget you
I will never let you go
I won't forget about the—
Uhm-mm no, no, mm-mm
No, I won't forget you (forget you), won't forget you (forget you, baby)
I will never let you go
