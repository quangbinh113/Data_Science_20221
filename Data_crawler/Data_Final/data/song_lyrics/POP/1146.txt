Song Name: Country Boy Do (feat. Tyler Hubbard)
Pull up outside, shawty hop up in the ride, got her sitting in the sky
That's just how a country boy do
Got some Buds on ice, and the bud rolled tight, just got off the nine to five
That's just how a country boy do
All week, I be rakin'
Long weekend, I be lakin'
We wrap the truck, no paintin'
We celebrate, tailgatin'
Country boy to the heart, strike me down if I'm lyin'
Yeah, I get there, Johnny Cash, I be walkin' the line
And yeah, they know me from the Show-Me down to South Carolina
Down to Mississippi, Alabama, sweet Georgia pine
They be like
Oh
That's just how a country boy do
Pull up outside, shawty hop up in the ride, got her sitting in the sky
That's just how a country boy do
Got some Buds on ice, and the bud rolled tight, just got off the nine to five
That's just how a country boy do
Got a 12-gauge shotty in my stand, sittin' on my land
That's just how a country boy do
Got a styrofoam cup in my hand, that's just who I am
And that's just how a country boy do
That's right
(Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This country boy got mad riches
My four-by-four before bad bitches
My pickup stood up mad inches
My Levi got that red stitchin', yeah
I be crankin' hits up outta Nashville, yeah
So many, I see why they call it Smashville, yeah
Another one, I'ma call it Cashville, yeah
Headbangers, you gon' need some Advil
Oh
That's just how a country boy do
Pull up outside, shawty hop up in the ride, got her sitting in the sky
That's just how a country boy do
Got some Buds on ice, and the bud rolled tight, just got off the nine to five
That's just how a country boy do
Got a 12-gauge shotty in my stand, sittin' on my land
That's just how a country boy do
Got a styrofoam cup in my hand, that's just who I am
And that's just how a country boy do
(That's just how a country boy do) that's right
(That's just how a, that's just how a country boy do)
That's just how a country boy do
(That's just how a country boy do)
(That's just how a, that's just how a country boy do)
That's just how a country boy do
(That's just how a country boy do)
(That's just how a, that's just how a country boy do)
(That's just how a country boy do)
(That's just how a, that's just how a country boy do)
That's just how a country boy do
Pull up outside, shawty hop up in the ride, got her sitting in the sky
That's just how a country boy do
Got some Buds on ice, and the bud rolled tight, just got off the nine to five
That's just how a country boy do
12-gauge shotty in my stand, sittin' on my land
That's just how a country boy do
Got a styrofoam cup in my hand, that's just who I am
And that's just how a country boy do
