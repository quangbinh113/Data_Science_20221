Song Name: Awkward
Time passing
Time, time passing
You wanted to know what the hype was all about
So I came back
Then we fucked a little bit and I was out
Did not say "bye"
It was worth it (ooh, it was)
I would do it again (hey)
I know you hurt me, but (hey)
This is more than a friendship
Now, I made it awkward
Why did you let me do it?
I made it, I make it awkward (hey, hey)
He wasn't ready for it (hey, hey)
But can we still love on each other?
Can we still touch on each other?
Can we still not judge each other?
You know, you know I make it awkward
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I cannot love everybody, but you isn't anybody
You look at me differеnt, so I let you see my body (body, body, body)
Now we don't seem to get along
Now I rеgret it all
Still, it was worth it
I would do it again
I know you hurt me, but
It is just deeper than friendship
Now, let's keep it awkward
I think we're ready for it, yeah, mmh
Let's keep it awkward
I know I'm ready for it, you feel me?
Can we still love on each other?
Can we still touch on each other?
Can we still not judge each other?
