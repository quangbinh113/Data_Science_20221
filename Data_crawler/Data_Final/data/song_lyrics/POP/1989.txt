Song Name: Limbo
Walk around the world, it feel like every place the same
I look into your eyes and see that you are in some pain
Freddie gonna help the business, help a rope around your neck
Gonna help you make a choice, let it sit, don't let it rest
You a pest, what the fuck, you left a mess
It's okay, I'll just say that your body's gone today
You in Hell, I don't think you failed, you just made some bail
Come that day, it gets worse and I hope you fucking hurt
Now what's the word, captain?
I think I caught you lackin'
There are ninе more layers than this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch I comе in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you
At the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold, and hot
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom baby, I swear I already got em'
Close your eyes and think of something for me
Think of all the times that you've been feeling kinda lonely
What could you do with your time instead?
What? You smoking weed, you fuck your bitch and go to bed
Notice all the colors that you seeing in your head
Now strip away that shit and feel the darkness, feel it spread
This is what is like to be known as dead
Now open up your eyes, you see the world it is red
Now what's the word, captain?
I think I caught you lackin'
There are nine more layers than this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch I come in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you
At the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold, and hot
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom baby, I swear I already got em'
Now what's the word, captain?
I think I caught you lackin'
There are nine more layers than this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch I come in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you
At the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold, and hot
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom baby, I swear I already got em'
