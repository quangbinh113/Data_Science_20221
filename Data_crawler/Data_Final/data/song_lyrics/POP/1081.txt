Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
For the rest, the rest...
I've never seen forever (oh yeah)
I've never seen forever in the wild
But now I'm looking now, I'm looking in its eyes
Baby, you're my shelter
Shelter from a broken paradise
I couldn't dream it any better if I tried
True love gotta ring, ring, ring
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring
This queen need a king, king, king
For life, for life, for life
True love gotta ring, ring, ring (ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Angels gonna sing, sing, sing
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
For the rest, the rest of your life
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
Marry me, marry me, say, "Yes"
For the rest, the rest of your life

Won't you love me baby?
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-marry me
I'ma fly out to Vegas (Vegas)
We could tie it up tonight, no patience
Take my last name, put it where your name is
Have they ever seen a love this famous?
They never, no, they never (na-na-na)
It's forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Ain't nobody do it better-better-better
And it's only getting better
True love gotta ring, ring, ring (ooh, we gotta)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (ooh, we gotta)
You're the queen, I'll be the king, king, king
For life, for life, for life (for life)
True love gotta ring, ring, ring (ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (ring, ring)
Angels gonna sing, sing, sing
