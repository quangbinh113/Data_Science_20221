Song Name: YOU'RE MY BABY
Haven't known you long
But I'm writing you this song
Take it as a message from me
Girl you have the eyes of venus
Rising from the sea
Watch you from a distance
I hardly can believe
You're my baby
You're my baby
Through the shifting sands
We are walking hand in hand
Ours a path that time can't erase
Girl you have a tender beauty
And a dancer's grace
Moving gently from me
To spin through time and space
You're my baby
You're my baby
Know that we will never
Really be apart
Know that love surrounds you
When you waken in the dark
And if you should ever
Dream that you must fly
Take your flights of fancy
I'll blow you a kiss goodbye
So wherever you may wander
Give a little thought to me
I will surely feel it
Darling can't you see
You're my baby
You're my baby
