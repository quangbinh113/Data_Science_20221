Song Name: Breakin' Away
Look what you've done for me
You're makin' more fun for me
Troubadour me, destined to be
Set in my ways, stuck in my daze

You were the butterfly
Winkin' at me, makin' my fires fly
Brought me romance, taught me to dance
Makin' me win, makin' me grin
Schoolin' me
Breakin' away
Your love has opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away
Your beacon in the night discovered me
Show me some parachutes

As long as I'm here, bring me some climbing boots
Open the door, give me some more
Fasten me in, loosen the pin
Pull for me
Breakin' away
Your love has opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away
Your beacon in the night discovered me
Breakin' away
Your love has opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away
Your beacon in the night discovered me
Breakin' away
Your love has opened eyes that couldn't see
Just breakin' away
Your beacon in the night discovered me
Breakin' away
Your love has opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away
Your beacon in the night discovered me
