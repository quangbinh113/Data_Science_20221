Song Name: Hi-Lo
Yeah
Oh
When I'm down, I'm the darkest
Then you come around and the sparks lit
I can be myself and be honest
I can be myself
I can build a wall out of sadness
You don't give a damn if I'm damaged
You know who I am and the fact is
I can be myself
There been times my friends didn't act like friends, but you did
There been times when I didn't like myself, but you did
I get high low
Up, down, then I go, yeah, slow
Hold on tight then I let go
You know how to make me feel like it's alright
To be high low
Right, wrong, no, you don't mind though
For me, you always got time so
You know how to makе me feel like it's alright
To be high (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low, low)
And I'm lеarnin' that it's all in
The perfect timin'
When there's love, there's just no denyin'
That I can be myself
There been times my friends didn't act like friends, but you did
There been times when I didn't like myself, but you did
I get high low
Up, down, then I go, yeah, slow
Hold on tight then I let go
You know how to make me feel like it's alright (like it's alright)
To be high low
Right, wrong, no, you don't mind though
For me, you always got time so
You know how to make me feel like it's alright
To be high (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low, low) yeah, oh
Yeah, that's just how it goes (to be high, low, low, low)
They're highs, then they're lows (high, low, low, low)
That's just how it goes (to be high, low, low, low, low)
You get it, you get it
That's just how it goes
They're highs, then they're lows
That's just how it goes
You get it, you get it
