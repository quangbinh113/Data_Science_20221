Song Name: Prisoner (feat. Dua Lipa)
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (oh-oh)
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away, I gotta know
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
I tasted heaven, now I can't live without it
I can't forget you, and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (can't control it)
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away, I gotta know
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind (off my mind)
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Can't get you off my mind (why can't you just let me go?)
Million times
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you?
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you?
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
