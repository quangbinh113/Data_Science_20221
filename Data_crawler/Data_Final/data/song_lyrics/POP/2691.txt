Song Name: Betty (Get Money)
With your baby mama at the crib I blow her back out
Shawty Filipino and she call me Manny Pacquiao
Alley-oop without the hoop they call me Jerry Stackhouse
Dazing out in public but your mama made me snap out
Before I get the dough got the morning routine
Wake up bright and early to some brand new cream
Floss three times, baby, I'm so clean
Gravy got cheese, now that's poutine
Gravy coming hot like I'm hoppin' off the griddle
Pull up on the kid if you tryna get belittled
All the mamas love me, now I think I'm peanut brittle
Flex the rainbow, bag it like some Skittles
Gravy why you out of pocket?
Stop it!
I'm gettin' money Gravy Crockett
(Drop it)
Never take an L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough
And get money
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (whoa)
And get money
You know I live the fast life
I don't got a type, baby, I'm the cash type
Still getting dividends from a past life
I'll get your daddy's net worth on a bad night
'Cause I act right
Rocking Rick, clapping astleys like the 80s
Never give it up until the reaper come and slay me
Pull up with a Zelda and a peach and a daisy
I be dirty dancing, now they yelling, "Gravy Swayze!"
Damn, Gravy you so vicious
You so clean, so delicious
How come you ain't got no misses?
Count that paper, count the riches
Never take an L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough
And get money
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (whoa)
And get money
