Song Name: Double Vision (feat. Tyga)
Girl 1
I swear I told myself that she's the one
Girl 2
I hate myself because I love her, too
Girl 1
She don't give me drama
Type that you bring home to mama
Girl 2
I try breaking up but I can't get enough
Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
Why you teasin' with your pants on?
Go on ahead, take 'em off
This a dance song
Play the ringtone, pour some alcohol
I don't wanna judge you, babe
But I can see your thong
On, off, kissing all your tickle spots
Faded, having double vision
Standing under mistletoe
King, gold chains and watch your cameltoe
She gon' say "You can't touch"
Like Hammer though
I'm on to the crack of dawn
Lifting up your skirt, I'm a flirt
Getting mega dome
Call a friend through, use my iPhone
Tell her come over right now
She never got home
Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
Somebody help me out
I'm love with these women
Somebody help me out
I'm love with these women
Somebody help me out
I can't make a decision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
