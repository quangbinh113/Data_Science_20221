Song Name: I Know You Know I Love You
Watch the sky, you know I
Like a star shining in your eyes
Sometimes I wonder why
Just wanna hold your hand
And walk with you side by side
I know you know
I love you, baby
I know you know
I love you, baby
Just wanted you to know
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I just wanna love you, baby
I know you know
I love you, baby
I know you know
I love you, baby
Just want you to know
You're my sunshine in the sky
I will be waiting for you, babe
