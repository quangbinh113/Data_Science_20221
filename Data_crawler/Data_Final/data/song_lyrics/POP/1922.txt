Song Name: Sunshine
Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine
Crazy, lately I've been findin'
Tryna write myself with somethin'
You just tryna get a word and life is not fair
I've been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin', but I don't care
I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Fail a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-ho!
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it
I, I, I, I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
Another day, another selfish moment
I've been feelin' helpless
Sick of seein' all the selfies, now I don't care
Found myself a new vocation
Calibrated motivation
Almost had to change the station
Headin' somewhere
I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-ho!
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it
But honestly man, lately I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
I don't really know any other way to say this
Can't slow down, tryna keep up with the changes
Punch that number, and the name wanna go out there
And now I feel I'm out here with a cane when I walk in
Basically, life is the same thing unless you don't want the same thing
Probably should've really got a feature but I didn't
I've been savin' up the money 'cause it's better for the business
I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine (yeah)
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
