Song Name: Moonshine
But why does the dawn have to take you away from me?
Break my heart into pieces, why?
When you were gone, I knew the whole world was incomplete
I'll be waiting where we always meet, tonight
I miss the moonlight when you're not around
I miss the time spent with you on the stary night
When you came back to town
I miss your big blue eyes, that made me fall in love with the sky
I miss the moonlight when you're not around
I miss the time spent with you on the stary night
When you came back to town
I miss your big blue eyes, that made me fall in love with the sky
