Song Name: Weak
No, thank you
Is what I should have said
I should be in bed, but temptations
Of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no, thank you
Is how it should have gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that)
No, thank you
They call me after dark
I don't want no part
My habits
They hold me like a grudge
I promise, I won't budge
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in is so easily
And no, thank you
Is how it should have gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
Fa-fa-fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
(Boy, oh boy, oh)
(Boy, oh boy, oh)
(Fall again)
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no, thank you
Is how it should have gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
