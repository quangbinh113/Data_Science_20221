Song Name: One Last Time (with R3HAB) (feat. Enny-Mae)
In my head right now
Voices too loud
I can't shut them up
Try to fake the fun
I can't slow down
Think I had enough
Guess that it means that I'm calling it off
I wanna go, though I stayed here for us
Messing up things and then calling it love
We're gonna dance, dance, dance through the night
With your ha-ha-hand right in mine
I'm gonna le-le-leave you behind
So let's dance, dance, dance one last time
And we can move, you and I
Until we lose our minds
I'm gonna le-le-leave you behind
So let's dance, dance, dance one last time
We're gonna
I can't eat, I can't breathe
Lost a part of me
But this is what we need
But you know I've learned
Sometimes good things hurt
I can't stay to please
Guess that it means that I'm calling it off
I wanna go, though I stayed here for us
Messing up things and then calling it love
I'm scared that I'll miss you so I take the chance
Need one more touch and then never again
Then I could say that we loved 'til the end
We're gonna dance, dance, dance through the night
With your ha-ha-hand right in mine
I'm gonna le-le-leave you behind
So let's dance, dance, dance one last time
And we can move, you and I
Until we lose our minds
I'm gonna le-le-leave you behind
So let's dance, dance, dance one last time
We're gonna
