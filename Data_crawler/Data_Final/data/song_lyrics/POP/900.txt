Song Name: Need To Feel Needed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Stop, don't turn that lock
Hold that key, don't drop
It won't take too long, it won't take too long
Stop with all the games
This ain't no charade
You know what I'm talking about
So slowly you and me
You can give me what I need
In this fantasy, we gon' ride, we gon' ride up in ecstasy
Baby, tell me do you believe, yeah (as a matter of fact, let's take it all the way to the back)
'Cause baby I, I'm drowning
I'm drowning in the thought of you, in the thought of you
Don't have to go, oh, oh
Here we know now till the break of dawn we go, go
'Cause all night it's ooh, ooh, ooh
Like ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, I'ma give you to three
Better see you back here with me
We'll be going down, rolling round, not a sound
Every moment counts (yeah, every moment counts)
Yeah, every moment counts (yeah, every moment counts)
We're doing 'em hard like them animals do
It's my instinct to get through to you
We can make it through, and your pays are due
Ready at the race to your heart
So slowly you and me
You can give me what I need
In this fantasy, we gon' ride, we gon' ride up in ecstasy
Baby, tell me do you believe, yeah (as a matter of fact, let's take it all the way to the back)
'Cause baby I, I'm drowning
I'm drowning in the thought of you, in the thought of you
Don't have to go, oh, oh
Here we know now till the break of dawn we go, go
'Cause all night it's ooh, ooh, ooh
Like ooh, ooh, ooh
I need to feel needed, yeah, yeah, oh...
'Cause baby I, I'm drowning
I'm drowning in the thought of you, in the thought of you (thought of you)
Don't have to go, oh, oh (don't have to go nowhere)
Here we know now till the break of dawn we go, go (bring it back, here we go)
'Cause all night it's ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh ooh)
Like ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh whoa, I need you baby
I need to feel needed
