Song Name: Blame (feat. John Newman)
Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep
So blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Can't you see it?
I was manipulated by it
To little to the down
Mmh, I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk
So blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the ni-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, babe
Yeah (I will be better this time, I will be better this time, I will be)
Oh, I got to say (Oh, I promise, I'll be better this time, I will)
So sorry (Be better this time, I will be)
Oh, I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me-e-e-e-e
