Song Name: Electric Love
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love (ah)
Electric love (ah-ah)
Drown me (drown me), you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me (oh), hold me deep beneath your waves
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love (ah)
Electric love (ah-ah)
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love (ah)
Baby, your electric
