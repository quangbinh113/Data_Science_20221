Song Name: wish i loved you in the 90s
You said you'd never lie
But you did it anyway
So how am I supposed to feel
When you said, "It's so real," to my face?
And you said you'd make a promise
But a promise never stays
So how am I supposed to act
When it's just how it is nowadays?
And I swear
We kinda fell in love with the pain
And I'm scared
We don't even know the right way
I wish I loved you in the '90s
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time, should've been alive
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the '90s
Back when life wasn't a blur
Say right guy, right vibe, wouldn't have to try
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the '90s

If I had loved you in the '90s
What happened to the guy
Picking up the girl?
And now you speed down the highway
And don't care to say a word
In my head, it's kinda dreamy
I imagine it with you
On the lawn, record on
Looking at the sky like '92, oh
And I swear
We kinda fell in love with the pain
And I'm scared
We don't even know the right way
I wish I loved you in the '90s
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time, should've been alive
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the '90s
Back when life wasn't a blur
Say right guy, right vibe, wouldn't have to try
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the '90s
If I had loved you in the '90s
Wish I loved you in the '90s
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time
Bet it wouldn't hurt
