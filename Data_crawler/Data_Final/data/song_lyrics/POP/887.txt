Song Name: Have You Ever
Walking down the streets so carelessly
One misstep you might fall
That's not all
Walking down the path in danger wrath
You end up being blown (so gone, so long)
Lonely times and lonely signs
It's easier to lie
'Cause you, have you ever wondered why the sea
Never cried for you when you say your dreams?
The sun is rising high
But all I see are tears
Oh you, have you ever felt so incomplete
Searching endlessly for thе missing piece?
Wait a little whilе it's gonna be alright
(Gosh, there are so many things I wanna tell you
It's been pretty rough
I wish we had more time)
Lonely times and lonely signs
No one can hear, no one so dear
Too much to say I'm fine, okay
It's easier to lie
'Cause you, have you ever wondered why the sea
Never cried for you when you say your dreams?
The sun is rising high but all I see are tears
Oh you, have you ever felt so incomplete
Searching endlessly for the missing piece?
Wait a little while it's gonna be alright
(You know what?
Whenever I look at the stars
I think of you
I just hope that you think of me too
I'll see you again soon)
