Song Name: Silver Tongues
Gettin' high on the amber wave
Going deep for the ones who do the same
Air Max's and silver tongues
Settle in for another heavy one
You said love was a pretty lie
And I choked when your smoke got in my eye
Bad logic and empty cans
I know nobody understands
Me like you do
You know, it's times like these
We're so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you
I'm so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
You said grass was a dirty drug
You like to preach with a vodka in your mug
I love all the things you know
But I'm king on a fifty-metre road
We stand up tall and beat our chests
We shout some things that we'll regret
Sit down with a master plan
I know nobody understands
Me like you do
You know, it's times like these
We're so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you
I'm so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
Because it's times like these
We're so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you
I'm so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
