Song Name: Lovesick
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la, ah)
Every night before I sleep
I pray that you will come to me
A million, million miles away
We'll meet again someday
I know that we'll find a way
We'll sing a bitter melody
And add a sweeter harmony
A symphony we'll make
So sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
I remember what you said
I got you stuck in my head
Did you think I would forget
The melodies you sang?
When you move me
Like nobody moves me
You're playing my heartstings
Like la-da-di-da-da
So sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la, la, la)
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la (ah)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la (ah-ah)
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la (ah)
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
Sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
