Song Name: Thank U, Next
Thought I end up with shine
Bernie wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now, I'm listen it back
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could said thank you to Malcom
'Cause he was an angel, yeah
One taught me love
One taught me patience
One taught me pain
And now, I'm so amazing
And look that I've lost
Bless for not what I've seen
And look for what I've got
Look what you've taught me
Thankful, then I say
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so f'cking grateful for my ex-s
Thank you, next
Thank you, I said thank you nextttt
Ouuu... uuuuu... yeahhh
Spend more times with my friends
I'm worried about nothing
But I met someone else
We have a better discussion
Yeah, I know you think "I'm move on too fast"
But this would gone last
'Cause her name is Rosie
And I'm so good with that
Yeah, she taught me love
She taught me patience
She handles pain
And that she's amazing
And love that I've lost
Bless for what I see
Look for what I found
No need for searching
And I'm gonna said
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so f'cking grateful for my ex-s, babe
