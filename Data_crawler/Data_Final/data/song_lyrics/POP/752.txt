Song Name: Wonder
So we drive on the left lane out in a rush
Looking back at the red lights passing us by
Yes, I know we shouldn't go that far
But I could wonder
Give me a feeling
Slowly in a déjà vu
Give me a feeling
Do you wanna feel it too
Give me a feeling
Slowly in a déjà vu
Give me a feeling
'Cause you wanna feel it too
If this time is the last drive out in the haze
Take me in for the last time into your eyes
Yes, I know we shouldn't go that far
But I could wonder
Give me a feeling
Slowly in a déjà vu
Give me a feeling
Do you wanna feel it too
Give me a feeling
Slowly in a déjà vu
Give me a feeling
Do you wanna feel it too
Give me a feeling
Slowly in a déjà vu
Give me a feeling
'Cause you wanna feel it too
