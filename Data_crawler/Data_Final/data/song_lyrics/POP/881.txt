Song Name: I Can Only Whisper (feat. BADBADNOTGOOD)
I can, I can only whisper (whisper)
I can only cry (cry), tonight
I wish I was with her
Yeah, we'd be getting by tonight
Instead I'm laying here by myself, yeah
Just thinking 'bout the way that it felt, yeah
'Cause she was there when nobody else
Couldn't make out the words in my mouth
I can only whisper (only, only whisper)
Now I can only cry tonight
I wish I was with her (only, only, only)
Yeah, we'd be getting by tonight
But here, the poet floats in a well, yeah
My words are soaking, coated in braille, yeah
I look up at everyone else, oh, yeah
With everything I wish I could yell
I can only whisper (only, only whisper)
Now I can only cry tonight
I wish I was with her (only, only, only)
'Cause we'd be getting by tonight
I can only whisper (only whisper)
I can only cry tonight (cry tonight)
If I could only see you now, I would be kissing you so sweetly
We'd be getting by tonight
