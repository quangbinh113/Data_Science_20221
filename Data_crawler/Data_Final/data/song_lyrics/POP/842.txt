Song Name: Nice to See You
Nice to see you, how you doing?
Did you know you're really something?
You make me feel things I don't believe in
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine, those chills
I suppose someday these roads will reach the sea
It's safe to say they're tailor-made for replaying scenes
But I'm too pensive to decide what's real
All cause you left me with a heart chock-full of chills
In the morning sun
You and I are one
Fingers through my hair
Feel them everywhere
Don't know what to think
Am I still dreaming?
You're so perfect, baby
Were you made for me?
Nice to see you, how you doing?
Did you know you're really something
You make me feel things I don't believe in
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine, those chills
Hope it works out in the long run
I think about you and then the month's gone
I raise the issue in tangential love songs
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine, those chills
Those chills, ah, those chills
Hold me, baby
Oh, you saved me
