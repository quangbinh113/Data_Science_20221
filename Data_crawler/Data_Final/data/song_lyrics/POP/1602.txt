Song Name: You Make Me Wanna...
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me (Make me), you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night
And lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how, you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
And what's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she, may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong
You make me, make me
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
Come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
