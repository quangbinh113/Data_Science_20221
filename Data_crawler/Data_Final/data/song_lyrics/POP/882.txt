Song Name: Under the Skin
Under this wonderful skin
Is hidden a deadly sin
Always the magical trick
Turn us into pigs and pricks
Wonder these beautiful teeth
Are they drooling, drooling over me?
Yeah, it's spreading over me
For a quite long time
Just let these nights go by
'Til the stars fall from the sky, I
Love her or just love her skin
It doesn't matter, same old sin
Sometimes the mystical lovesick
It could make us lunatic
Again these beautiful teeth
Are they drooling over mе?
Yeah, it's dripping over me
For a quitе long time
Just let these nights go by
'Til the stars fall from the sky, I-
Deep under this wonderful skin
Is hidden a deadly sin (deadly sin)
Always the magical trick
It could make us, make us all the pricks
I wonder these beautiful teeth
Are they drooling, drooling over me?
I bet you better sing with me
The voice under the skin, she sings
I bet you better sing it with me
The voice is drowning me, I'll sink
