Song Name: Summer Love
Miles and miles I drive to search the love that I wanna vibe with
Smiles and smiles I drive to search the love that I wanna survive with
Let the wind blow your hair
Let the wind blow your spirit
Let the vibe add to your survival
Let the vibe add to your revival
Let the wind blow your hair
Let the wind blow your spirit
Let the vibe add to your survival
Let the vibe add to your revival
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Someone I love someone I love
Do you wanna be someone I love someone I love
Someone I love
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Miles and miles I drive to search the love that I wanna vibe with
Smiles and smiles I drive to search the love that I wanna survive with
Let the wind blow your hair
Let the wind blow your spirit
Let the vibe add to your survival
Let the vibe add to your revival
Let the wind blow your hair
Let the wind blow your spirit
Let the vibe add to your survival
Let the vibe add to your revival
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Someone I love someone I love
Do you wanna be someone I love someone I love
Someone I love
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Someone I love someone I love
Do you wanna be someone I love someone I love
Someone I love
Summer love summer love
Do you wanna be my summer love summer love
Someone I love
Someone I love someone I love
Do you wanna be someone I love someone I love
Someone I love
Summer love summer love
Summer love summer love
