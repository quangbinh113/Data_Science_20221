Song Name: Do It Again (feat. 2Rare)
You abandoned me, I don't live here anymore

Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong
You lyin', watch yo' tone
I'm too fine to be so alone
Not my kind, he is a clone
I'ma get money no matter the cost (cost)
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss (Voss)
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss (loss)
He is a worker and I am a boss
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong
(You lyin', watch yo' tone)
I'm too fine to be so alone
(Not my kind, he is a clone)
I'ma get money no matter the cost
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss
He is a worker and I am a boss
You abandoned me, I don't live here anymore
Bitch, go crazy
Bitch, go crazy
Bitch, go crazy
Bitch, go crazy
Don't wanna be homies, don't wanna be friends (you abandoned me)
Beat my dick 'fore I hit you again
Bitch, I'm in love, won't get me again
Where's my heart? Gone in the wind
Like, for real
Bitch, you know love get you killed
I don't write it, I say how it feel (bah)
Tryna think about how I'ma heal (I'ma heal)
You think you slick? Ayy, ayy (you abandoned me)
You easy to read
Pack yo' bags and leave my keys (keys, like a memory)
I'ma forget about you when you leave (leave)
Fuck your friend, but that'll be greed
Send me a message, I left it on seen (seen)
Light, keep it a beam
Say that you love me, it's really a scheme (really a lie)
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
You lyin', watch yo' tone
I'm too fine to be so alone
Not my kind, he is a clone
I'ma get money no matter the cost (cost)
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss (Voss)
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss (loss)
He is a worker and I am a boss
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
(You lyin', watch yo' tone)
I'm too fine to be so alone
(Not my kind, he is a clone)
I'ma get money no matter the cost
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss
He is a worker and I am a boss
You did it before, you will do it again
(You did it before, you will do it again)
You did it before, you will do it again
(You did it before, you will do it again)
Like, for real
Got me workin' and coverin' bills
Got a new girl, she keep it real
She call me, "Daddy," she love how it feel, ayy
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
You lyin', watch yo' tone
I'm too fine to be so alone (like a memory)
Not my kind, he is a clone
I'ma get money no matter the cost (cost)
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss (Voss)
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss (loss)
He is a worker and I am a boss
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
(You lyin', watch yo' tone)
I'm too fine to be so alone
(Not my kind, he is a clone)
I'ma get money no matter the cost
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss
He is a worker and I am a boss
I just got a new thot, DJ Khaled, that's another one (you abandoned me)
Y'all niggas just like Kool-Aid, y'all be sweet but y'all ain't jammin' us (like a memory)
I don't know what you thought it was, bitch
What the fuck you want?
Bitch, you like a squirrel, you just like Sandy
Bitch, get off my nuts
I think hold that bitch like choppa
I'm on they head and they gon' die tryin'
Who fuckin' with us? It's gas, no violence
Chain on froze, you could play some hockey
Talk so hot, what you ate, them Takis?
Had to double twice like she was 40
You better add it up
Like two plus two, you wasn't for me
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
You lyin', watch yo' tone
I'm too fine to be so alone
Not my kind, he is a clone
I'ma get money no matter the cost (cost)
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss (Voss)
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss (loss)
He is a worker and I am a boss
Lil' baby, you act like you know you was wrong (you abandoned me)
(You lyin', watch yo' tone)
I'm too fine to be so alone
(Not my kind, he is a clone)
I'ma get money no matter the cost
Havin' some water, I'm havin' some Voss
Got that dope dick, that's yo' loss
He is a worker and I am a boss
You abandoned me
You abandoned me
You abandoned me, I don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, I don't live here anymore
