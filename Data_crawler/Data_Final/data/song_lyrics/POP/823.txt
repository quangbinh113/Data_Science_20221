Song Name: ONLY A LOVE AFFAIR
Here we are starting over
What we had still is there
Never something we could hold onto
It was only a love affair
Now again I'm reaching out for you
Seems we can't lose our love affair
You and I fell too soon
In a way we were scared
How the real world can fade from view
In the power of a love affair
Making promises you can't see through
In the heat of a love affair
Oh, just a love affair
Oh, an amazing love affair
Oh, an amazing love affair
A love affair
Let you in once again
Found my life to be bare
Couldn't find the magic we had been
And I look for it everywhere
With you in my arms I can't pretend
This is only a love affair
Oh, just a love affair
Oh, an amazing love affair
Oh, an amazing love affair
A love affair
Oh, it was just a love affair
Oh, an amazing love affair
Oh, it was just a love affair
A love affair
