Song Name: Pictures of You
We were special (special)
'Cause we were exceptions
Breaking rules and expectations
Together through annihilations
I've been
Tryna figure what happened (happened)
Why are we so different, yet indifferent
For the same occasions?
You were never just a typical soul
But, baby, look at us now
There was definitely more to show
But, babe, it's all over now
I'm just tryna get over you
Like how they always do
Deleted pictures of you
I'm just trying to find a way to
To make 'em think I do (I do)
I do get by without you (get by without you)
I know I'm just a terrible boyfriend
(I know I'm just a terrible boyfriend)
I keep dragging you into my own mess
But now that we're faced with a dead-end
(But now that we're faced with a dead-end)
I can't think of anything that I can do, but just pretend
That I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm just tryna get over you
Like how they always do
Deleted pictures of you
I'm just trying to find a way to
To make them think I do
I do get by without you
