Song Name: I'll Be Missing You (feat. Faith Evans & 112)
Yeah, this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfil your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray, I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break, I'll be missing you (miss you, Biggie)
It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in Heaven smilin' down (uh)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day, we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death
Every step I take
Every move I make (I'll miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Somebody tell me why
One black morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every day that passes (every step I take)
Is a day that I get closer (every move I make)
To seeing you again (every single day)
We miss you B.I.G. (every night I pray)
And we won't stop (every step I take)
'Cause we can't stop (every move I make)
That's right (every single day)
Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
We miss you B.I.G. (we miss you)
Every single day
Every step I take
Every move I make (ohh, I'll miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you (I'll be missing you)
Thinkin' of the day (thinking of the day), when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Every step I take
Every move I make (one black morning) (when this life is over)
Every single day, every time I pray (I know)
I'll be missing you (I'll see your face)
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away (one black morning) (when this life is over)
