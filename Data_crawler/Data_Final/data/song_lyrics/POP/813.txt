Song Name: With Me
When you're here with me
When we see the blue sky up above
Nothing's better
We slump down before
Grabbing our camera once more
Take the memories more
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
You're always be with me
Even in the dark and such a long way
There's nothing to say
Do you know that I
Really would not have made it this far
Without you
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
When you're here I feel
Like floating in the sky
That the evening sunlight
Has still been shining
Are you realizing
This is the moment
That doesn't need words
For you and me
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
I'll just let you know
That I won't let you go
When you're here I feel
Like floating in the sky
That the evening sunlight
Has still been shining
Are you realizing
This is the moment
That doesn't need words
For you and me
When you're here with me
When you're here with me
When you're here with me
When you're here with me
