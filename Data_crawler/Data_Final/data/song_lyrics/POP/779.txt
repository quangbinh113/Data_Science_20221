Song Name: On and On
I never thought I had a chance
You seemed so sure of what you wanted
But I guess everybody's lookin' to disappear
You're the only road I can see from here
And I don't mind it gettin' us nowhere
'Cause I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' since we split
Said a lot of things when I didn't know shit
And I should've loved you more, that's the truth of it
Sometimes I'm slow to the mark
Been in a lot of places I don't fit
I know we're better
I know we're more if we take the chance
This one could run on and on
With all those sparks that never catch
(The way it is, just the way it is)
And all those birds that never fly back
(The way it is, just the way it is)
If you're still lookin' for a place to disappear
There's a lot of sky I can see from here
If you don't mind it gettin' us nowhere
'Cause I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' since we split
Said a lot of things when I didn't know shit
And I should've loved you more, that's the truth of it
But sometimes I'm slow to the mark
Been in a lot of places I don't fit
I know we're better
I know we're more if we take the chance
This one could run on and on
On and on
On and on
(The way it is, just the way it was)
On and on
(The way it is, just the way it was)
On and on, on and on...
On and on
(The way it is, just the way it...)
