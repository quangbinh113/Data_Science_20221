Song Name: The Way We Were (feat. Plested)
Last night, you were in my dream
Just like nothin' ever changed at all
Guess I'm hopin' that it means
It's not too late for second chances
Oh, I'm alive through the memories
Yeah, I just can't let 'em die
Time-wastin', life-changin'
Say we can go back, darlin'
Just the way we were
Yeah, I know
Ain't no minute, I don't miss it
Say someday that we'll be dancin'
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Oh, yeah-ah, no
True, it's all the little things
Day drunk, dancin' with your eyes closed
Start out, just a couple drinks
End up wonderin' where the night goes
I'm alive through the memories
Yeah, I just can't let 'em die
Time-wastin' and life-changin'
Say we can go back, darlin'
Just the way we were
Yeah, I know
There ain't no minute, I don't miss it
Say someday that we'll be dancin'
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Just the way we were
Oh, yeah-ah, no
