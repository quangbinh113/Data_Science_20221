Song Name: Big Energy (feat. DJ Khaled) - Remix
This the remix (haha)
Is Miami in the house? (Sweet, sweet fantasy)
Is Atlanta in the house?
Is New York in the house?
Got that big dick energy (Mimi, Latto, DJ Khaled)
Hey, daddy, when you gon' stop playin'? (Another one)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy (uh-huh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (yeah)
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (ayy)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet, sweet
You gon' have to come and see this
Pretty like new-new, sweet like peaches
I'ma be your fantasy, you ain't gon' believe this
Hold up, got Mimi on the remix (on and on and on)
On the count of three, bad bitches, get money (money)
Broke niggas to the left, we don't want it (we don't want)
I'm the one they love to hate, but they can't get past (uh-huh)
Pretty face, no waist and a big ol' ass, ha (on and on it goes)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy (uh-huh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (no)
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (ayy)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Sweet fantasy
Got that big, big energy (big dick energy)
Sweet fantasy
Got that big, big energy (big dick energy)
Yeah, tell me how you want it (want it)
Three, two, one, camera rollin' (ooh)
Do it slow motion (uh-huh)
Real bitch, them other hoes phony
All that big talk, Latto put 'em on it (Latto)
I'm just bein' honest, Lingerie, Dolce (ha)
Blindfold, tie me to the bed, while we role-play (yeah)
Can't skip foreplay, kill the pussy cold case (uh-huh)
I'm a boss bitch, but tonight we do it your way
On the count of three, bad bitches, get money (get money, sweet baby)
Broke niggas to the left, we don't want it (sweet baby)
If you ever see me broke, I'm probably rockin' a cast
Pretty face, no waist with a big ol' bag, ha (sweet)
Sweet fantasy (I could be your fantasy)
Got that big, big energy (big dick energy)
Sweet fantasy (I could be your fantasy)
Got that big, big energy (big dick energy)
Go on, Big Latto say
Big Latto say (uh-huh)
Go on, Big Latto say (it's a new world)
Big Latto say (big dick energy)
It's Latto, it's Mariah (fantasy)
And I'm looking at my wrist, and it's a new watch
This the remix
