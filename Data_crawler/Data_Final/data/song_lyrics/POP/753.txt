Song Name: Hunky Dory
There's a lonely thought i saw in sight of you
It's killing me and I feel suffocated
In my head I feel isolated
Somehow i feels like connected
On my own reflection
Open your mind and let your heart decide
I'll be so fine when you're not mine
(Just leave me behind along the sideline)
Just leave me behind along the sideline
(I'll be so fine 2x)
I'll be so fine when you're not mine
(Just leave me behind along the sideline)
Just leave behind...
Take the ride
I'll shine bright
