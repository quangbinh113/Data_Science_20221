Song Name: Everybody's Changing
You say, you wander your own land
But when I think about it, I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says everybody's changing, and I don't know why

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing, and I don't feel the same
You're gone from here
Soon you will disappear, fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing, and I don't feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing, and I don't feel the same
So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing, and I don't feel the same
Oh, everybody's changing, and I don't feel the same
