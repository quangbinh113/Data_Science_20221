Song Name: Summer Rain (feat. Jazmine Sullivan)
You're speaking a language no one speaks
In a room that don't exist
I'm just gonna shut up
And bear witness
You are everything
Wanna feel you all around
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down
Don't stop now
Don't stop now, now, now
Forty days and forty nights
Wrapped in covers, drenched in white
And it's getting warmer, like a sauna
I don't wanna make it out alive
'Cause you, you are everything
Wanna feel you all around
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down, down, down
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down
Don't stop now
Don't stop now, now, now
Keep it coming down
Don't stop now
Wanna feel you on me
Don't stop now, now, now (don't stop, don't stop please)
