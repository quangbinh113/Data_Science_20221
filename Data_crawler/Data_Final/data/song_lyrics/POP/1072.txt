Song Name: SNOWMAN
Yeah, yeah
Skrr, skrr, ay
(94 don't need no brakes, yeah)
Hey
I just got some ice, I feel like Gretzky (Gretzky)
Diamonds on me, now you wanna check me (check me)
I've been steady focused on the commas (commas)
My heart is cold, I blame that on the trauma
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
Last night, I ate lobster in a Bimmer (ay)
Diamonds on me lookin' like a freezer (hey)
Brand-new money, Justin like I'm Bieber (ay)
Now they starin' at me, Mona Lisa (hey)
Let me paint the picture on my art shit (art)
I'm ballin' on these haters like it's March, bitch (true)
I just put some ice on where my heart is
Lil' shorty say, "I'm cold just like the Arctic"
But don't blame me, baby girl, blame it on the two-seater
Gold chain, iceberg, but I'm still ridin' with a heater
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just got some ice, I feel like Gretzky (Gretzky)
Diamonds on me, now you wanna check me (check me)
I've been steady focused on the commas (commas)
My heart is cold, I blame that on the trauma
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, ho, ho, diamonds look like snow globe, yeah (snow) yeah
Rose gold, tall hoe, stuntin' like I'm Stone Cold, yeah
Ooh, and I just think it's funny
How it's sunny, but their nose is always runny, yeah
VV's jumpin' like a bunny (woo)
Now she say she love me, but I'm married to the money, ay
I'm sorry honey
But don't blame me, baby girl, blame it on the two-seater
Gold chain, iceberg, but I'm still ridin' with a heater
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just got some ice, I feel like Gretzky (ice)
Diamonds on me, now you wanna check me (ooh)
I've been steady focused on the commas (commas, yeah)
My heart is cold, I blame that on the trauma
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
Snowman, bitch, you know that I'm frozen, yeah, yeah
