Song Name: london
Rain
Halos hanging on streetlights in the rain
Memories hanging on these walls at my place
I've been living my life staying out of your way
Out of your way
When the sky turns to grey
I wish I would've stayed
If you asked me if I love you
I still do
Sometimes when it's cold in California
I think back to that winter with you
'Cause living in Los Angeles, the skies are always blue
Sometimes I miss London
Sometimes I miss you
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Hey
Like the lights go down in the city, I let you down
And the palm trees here are pretty, but I hate this town
And I hatе myself sometimes for not sticking around
Sticking it out
Whеn the sky turns to grey
Do you wish I'd've stayed?
If I asked you if you love me
Do you?
Sometimes when it's cold in California
I think back to that winter with you
'Cause living in Los Angeles, the skies are always blue
Sometimes I miss London
Sometimes I miss you
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I miss you in the summer
Those goddamn days are longer (days are longer)
I miss you in the winter
(It's cold in California) it's cold in California (in California)
I miss you in the summer (oh, in the summer)
Those goddamn days are longer (days are longer)
I miss you in the winter
It's cold in California
Sometimes when it's cold in California
I think back to that winter with you
I do, I do, I do
'Cause living in Los Angeles, the sky is always blue
Next time I see London
I hope that I see you
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (hope that I see you)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (oh, I hope that I, hope that I see) (I hope that I see)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (oh, I hope that I, hope that I, hope that I)
(Hope that I, hope that I, hope that I)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
