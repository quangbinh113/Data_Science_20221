Song Name: Paris to the Moon
I never flown in my life, little girl
I never understood
Now we're taking a flight to see the world
I thought we could
Sit alone
Free coffee and a movie
Our bird had flown
Sit alone
We'll talk about the movie
All because I want to go to
Paris, to the moon
I want to go to Paris to the moon
We'll all take Paris to the moon
I want to go to Paris to the moon
I know what luxury's like, little girl
I'm sitting in its lap
Know that I'm 'afraid of heights, little girl
Now we're in first class
Sit alone
I'm looking out the window far from my home
Sit alone
No worries in the suitcase
Oh, I only want to go to
Paris, to the moon
I want to go to Paris to the moon
We'll all take Paris to the moon
I want to go to Paris to the moon
I know a man that can get you there
But it'll cost you a minimal fare
Je veux aller à Paris à la lune
Je veux aller à Paris à la lune
(...) à Paris à la lune
Je veux aller à Paris à la lune
