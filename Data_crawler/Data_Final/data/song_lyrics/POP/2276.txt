Song Name: why didn't you call???
Why didn't you call?
Are you away?
Are you okay?
I'm sat by the phone
Not too much on
So much to say
Did you get into a car crash?
Always going too fast
God forbid, did somebody die?
There's just no way I slipped your mind
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
I messaged your friend
Then hit unsend
I'm not that desperate
And you might be asleep
Dreaming of me
I know I'm just guessing
Did you think we said tomorrow?
I'm sure you meant to follow through
This isn't like you
There's just no way I slipped your mind
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
It happens all the time
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Maybe I killed the mood
It's something that I would do
I'm sorry if I ruined your night
By needing too much from you
Needing too much from you (no way)
There's just no way, no way that I
Just no way I slipped your mind (mind)
Do, do, do, do
Why didn't you call?
It happens all the time
So, why didn't you call?
Yeah, yeah, why, why?
Why didn't you call?
Hmm, why, why? (Do, do, do, do)
Why didn't you call? (Do, do, do, do)
(Happens all the time)
(Do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do)
