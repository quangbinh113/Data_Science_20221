Song Name: Runaway
Even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away
Yeah, even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never be afraid
I will never run away, run away
'Cause looking back on better days just ain't okay
Just know that even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away, oh
Open up my soul again, see who can make it whole again
Hold my breath and breathe you in, and you could never leave me then
I feel like I'm dying to live, but I am just trying to give
This fire inside burns brighter, it dies
You can have my heart 'cause you already have my soul
And I just wanted to let you know
'Cause even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away
Yeah, even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never be afraid
I will never run away, run away
'Cause looking back on better days just ain't okay
Just know that even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away, oh
I can't speak when my thoughts are misspoken
I'm holding in so much pain that I'm choking
I'm hoping that better days are approaching
And searching for ways to keep from exploding
Take a good look at me, I'm broken
And I know I can't rely on no one
This ain't even the life I've chosen
I gotta go now, the beast has woken
You can have my heart 'cause you already have my soul
And I just wanted to let you know
'Cause even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away
Yeah, even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never be afraid
I will never run away, run away
'Cause looking back on better days just ain't okay
Just know that even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away, oh
Fading out and I am fading now
My hands toward Heaven, won't you come back down?
You are fading out and I am fading now
My hands toward Heaven, won't you come back down?
'Cause even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away
Yeah, even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never be afraid
I will never run away, run away
'Cause looking back on better days just ain't okay
Just know that even in this heartless place, during the darkest days
I'll never run away, oh-oh
