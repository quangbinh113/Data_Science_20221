Song Name: Angry
Pack up the stars
Turn off the moon
Shut down the airports
Turn off the news
Tell all your friends it's time to go home
Didn't you hear
Hear what had happened
So meant to be but we lost all the magic
Pack up the stars
Turn off the moon
Oh, I'm so confused right now
Why is everybody not angry?
Crying out
Throwing empty bottles at walls
Why is everybody so happy
In the sun like nothing ever happened at all?
At all
Oh, 'cause my world
Just fell apart
But to anyone else
I'm just another broken heart, oh
Why is everybody not angry?
Oh
Close all the blinds
Shut off the noise
Turn down the music
I had it all
But sometimes, the ending
You don't get to choose it
And didn't you hear
Hear in the papers
Thought I saw the future but I was mistaken
Close all the blinds
Shut off the noise
Oh, I'm so confused right now
Why is everybody not angry?
Crying out
Throwing empty bottles at walls
Why is everybody so happy
In the sun like nothing ever happened at all?
At all
Oh, 'cause my world
Just fell apart
But to anyone else
I'm just another broken heart, oh
Why is everybody not angry?
Oh
Why is everybody not angry?
Crying out
Throwing empty bottles at walls
Why is everybody so happy
In the sun like nothing ever happened at all?
At all
Oh, 'cause my world
Just fell apart
But to anyone else
I'm just another broken heart, oh
Why is everybody not angry?
