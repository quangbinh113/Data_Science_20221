Song Name: All By Myself
I lost my own belief
Always something breaking me was overcome
Walking these lonely streets
Even in good company, I want to run
But now I'm embracing the way I am
I don't need, nobody to hold my hand
I'm doing it, doing it all by myself
I'm movin' it, movin' it all by myself
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothing they're saying
I'm loving me, loving me all by myself

All by myself
All by myself, myself
All by myself
They turned the best of me into my insecurities they shout so loud
No parties with fake friends
I never wanna blend into the crowd
No more going places I don't belong
They're gonna say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong
I'm doing it, doing it all by myself
I'm movin' it, movin' it all by myself
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothing they're saying
I'm loving me, loving me all by myself
All by myself
All by my-my-my
All by myself, myself
No more going places I don't belong
You can say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong
And now I'm breaking free from what they wanted me to be
And I'm me, finally, oh-oh
I'm doing it, doing it all by myself (self-self)
All by myself (self-self-self)
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothing they're saying
I'm loving me, loving me, all by myself
All by myself, myself
All by myself
All by my-my-my
All by myself, myself
All by myself
