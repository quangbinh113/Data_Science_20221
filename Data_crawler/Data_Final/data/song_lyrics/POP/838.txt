Song Name: A Little While
("What's your definition of love?")
"Love...
It's kinda like, you know
When you see a fog in the morning, when you wake up
Before the sun comes out
It's just for a little while, and then it burns away..."
Broken by the love
This hurt divides itself
Decided that kissing you is just bad for my health
So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
I looked you right in your eye
And asked you why it has to be this way
And to my suprise, you did say
This is just you and I babe
You and I babe
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
