Song Name: This I Promise You
When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along

And I will take, you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever, in lifetimes before
And I promise you never, will you hurt anymore
I give you my word, I give you my heart (I give you my heart)
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow forever has now begun
Just close your eyes, each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away, no
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you
Over and over I fall, (over and over I fall), when I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all
And I will take, (I will take you in my arms), you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you babe
Just close your eyes, each loving day (each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away, (no)
Every word I say is true, this I promise you
Every word I say is true, this I promise you
Ooh I promise you
