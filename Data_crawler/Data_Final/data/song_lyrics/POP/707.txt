Song Name: Good Friend Song
Sometimes, I daydream unrealistically
Sometimes, I share memes
They say I'm crazy
But I don't care what they think
I don't care how they judge me
As long as you are with me
That's all I need
You said there is no right or wrong
Just don't be afraid and sing our song
We can celebrate or just relax
For all night long
In my eyes, you're always beautiful
So there's nothing to worry at all
The world cannot define us who we are anymore
We go get ice cream
When it is freezing
And we make loud noise
Pretty much constantly
But I don't care what they think
I don't care how they judge me
As long as you are with me
That's all I need
You said there is no right or wrong
Just don't be afraid and sing our song
We can celebrate or just relax
For all night long
In my eyes, you're always beautiful
So there's nothing to worry at all
The world cannot define us who we are anymore
