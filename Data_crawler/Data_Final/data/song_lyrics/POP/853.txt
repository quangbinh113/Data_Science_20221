Song Name: Bike
Riding into the sunlight, I was 25
She followed me to the coastline
We ran away from the town
My Baby Blue, it was still fine
Could still make a sound
There was nothing but a white line
And there was plenty of time
Could this be the paradise city from my recollection?
Could she be my summertime lover I set out to find?
You, merry woman, I'm a man of action
You, merry woman, am I qualified?
You, merry woman, I'm a man of action
You, merry woman, are you satisfied?
We hid away to the moonlight
Behind the merry-go-round
She told me that it was alright
And there was plenty of time
Could this be the paradise city from my recollection?
Could she be my summertime lover I set out to find?
You, merry woman, I'm a man of action
You, merry woman, am I qualified?
You, merry woman, I'm a man of action
You, merry woman, are you satisfied?
