Song Name: this is what sadness feels like
Roses red and
Violets lookin' blue like me
So poetic
So pathetic
To think I ever thought you'd be
Sympathetic
I know you don't care at all
Please don't ask how I been
I ain't heard from you in months
So don't call me a friend when you're not
So I'm just gon' put on a sad song
And sit in my room with the lights off
And put on a face that I won't show anyone
Yeah I'm just gon' put on a sad song
And cry out my eyes til the nights gone
And put on a face that I won't show anyone
So don't call me a friend when you're not
So don't call me a friend when you're not
So don't call me a friend when you're not
Feeling depressed, yeah, I been dealing with stress
These demons they fight me
Cut out the fakes, yeah, I been dealing with snakes
And they try to bite me
I been down so bad, with nobody near me
I been down so sad, can anyone hear me?
I turned my back, I got stabbed
I'm so sad, sad
Feeling depressed, yeah, I been dealing with stress
These demons they fight me
Cut out the fakes, yeah, I been dealing with snakes
And they try to bite me
I been down so bad, with nobody near me
I been down so sad, can anyone hear me?
I been down so sad
