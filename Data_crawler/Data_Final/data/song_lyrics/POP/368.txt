Song Name: Anywhere With You
Wherever you go, you know I'd follow you
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere with you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Just so you know, I got your back, that's true
And I'd do anything, anything, anything for you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Wherever you go, you know I'd follow you
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere with you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Wherever you go, you know I'd follow you
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere with you
Just say, "Let's go", I'd run away with you
Yeah, I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
