Song Name: In My Bones (feat. Kimbra & Tank and The Bangas)
Get it Uh There's a funky feelin' in my bones,
In my bones In my bones I got that funky feelin' And I don't wanna
Feel it on my own, on my own What-a-do There's a constant tappin' in
My toes, in my toes In my toes I get this tappin' feelin' Got to tell
You somethin', I don't know
I don't know What-a-do If there's a thing you wanna get right Then
Now's the time to get that funky feelin' right If there's a thing you
Wanna get right Then get the boogie in your bones all through the
Night There's a pressin' question on your lips
On your hips On your lips you got some kind of question Like you got
Somethin' to say, ha, ha, ha It's a question I could answer with some,
With some kiss What-a-do There's a kind of magic in your smile,
In your smile In your smile
I found some kind of magic Kinda think I wanna stay a while,
Stay a while What-a-do If there's a thing (if there's a thing) You
Wanna get right (you wanna get right) Then now's the time to get that
Funky feelin' right If there's a thing (if there's a thing) You wanna
Get right (you wanna get right) Then get the
Boogie in your bones all through the night (
Boogie, boogie, play, boy) Now I got this feelin' in my Be my rush,
Be my crush, be my fantasy Get my blush, feel my touch, baby,
You can see Now's the time to get that funky feelin' on me So use it
Up, wear it out, oh Now I got this feelin' in my Be my rush,
Be my crush, be my fantasy Get my blush, feel my touch, baby,
You can see Now's the time to get that funky feelin' on me So use it
Up, wear it out, oh Now I got this feelin' in my bones I been
Obsessin' 'bout the present ever since a adolescent Down
The edge of Queen and Crescent and you got me incandescent '
Cause now you got me guessin' if it's me you
Love or Djesse Do you wanna make me crazy or what?
And you don't know nothin' of my struggle
You think I'm in a bubble And I ain't got nothin' to say,
I ain't got nothin' to say No way, not today
So come again another day I'm speakin' Spanish, English
Mandarin Little French for the bougie hoes in mansions Reach in
Gotta fish for the compliments Missin' is a whole lot of baggage
Messin' with me is tragic You a whole fan bandwagon
Black girl, black girl magic Hey, hey, hey, what's happenin'?
I'd never expect you to realize you're free That the powers that be
Are just the powers you see around you Only as powerful as the truth
You've told Every span of concentration in the idea cultivation Every
Adding decoration to the shores of deprivation
Whoa I'd never expect you to realize you're free That the powers that
Be are just the powers you see around you Only as powerful as the
Truth you've told Be my rush, be my crush, be my fantasy Get my blush,
Feel my touch, baby
You can see Now's the time to get that funky feelin' on me So use it
Up, wear it out, oh Now I got this feelin' in my Be my rush,
Be my crush, be my fantasy Get my blush, feel my touch, baby,
You can see Now's the time to get that funky feelin' on me So use it
Up, wear it out Use it up, wear it out Use it up, wear it out,
Oh Now I got this feelin' in Now I got this
Feelin' Now I got this funky feelin' in my Bones
