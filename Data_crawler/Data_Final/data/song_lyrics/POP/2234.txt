Song Name: No More Drama
Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
Took a year before I recognized
That our love had already died
Baby, I was down bad, I was down bad
Now I'm healing (yeah)
Some nights, you would stay here
Some nights, you would disappear
Now I'll never go back, never go back
To that feeling
Baby, I ain't even wondering
About everything we could've been
Evеr since you looked me in my еyes, turned around
And said goodbye
Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (oh-oh)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized (yeah)
I'm better without you
You start fights while we're up late
Use your lips to manipulate (uh)
Baby, how'd you do that? How'd you do that?
Make me need it
Some nights, you were "baby"
Some nights, it was crazy
Now I'll never go back, never go back
To that feeling
Baby, I ain't even wondering
About everything we could've been
Ever since you looked me in my eyes, turned around (yeah)
And said goodbye (hey)
Oh, I got no more drama in my life (oh-oh)
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized (yeah)
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (drama my life)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
Oh-oh
Alone, mm-mm
