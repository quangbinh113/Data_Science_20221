Song Name: Lose Somebody
It's a classic me mistake
Someone gives me love and I throw it all away
Tell me have I gone insane?
Talkin' to myself but I don't know what to say
'Cause you let go
And now I'm holdin' on
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh-oh-oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody
So don't tell me it's too late
Hearts are made to bend, baby, please don't let me break, yeah
I knew I should've stayed
'Cause now you're movin' on and I don't know what to say
'Cause you let go (yeah, you let go)
And now I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on)
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh-oh-oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
