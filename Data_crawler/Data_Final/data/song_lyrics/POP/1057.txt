Song Name: KEEP IT UP
Every time I open my mouth
I have regrets in my mind every time
And no one seems to figure me out
I guess it's stress
It's making me feel so depressed
Most my life, I've felt so tired
But every now and then when I try, I say
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
It's enough, keep it up
Now I'm here, and I wish that I wasn't
I'm in a place in front of a dozen people I've never met
And I don't know if this is correct
I guess I'm blessed
I never give myself respect
Most my life, I'm asking why
But anytime I give it a try, I say
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
It's enough, keep it up
Yeah, it's enough
I've really had enough
Paid the price, I'm done, no
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
But it's enough, keep it up
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up, keep it up
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
No, no, mm-mm
