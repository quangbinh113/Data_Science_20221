Song Name: Missing You (with Ashe)
What if the windows flew off all the buildings and I could not see you again?
It'd be as if the sun decided to stop shining, and I could not breathe you in
What if the winter takes off with the leaves and they don't grow back in spring?
That'd be the feeling of my heartbeat fleeting cause I know it's you I needed
We're getting caught in the static, our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic, I still wanna have it
There's no going back to that life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful, I think you're an angel
With the face of my children, I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through, I was missing you
What if the stars lost all of their glitter and they fell down from the sky?
That'd be like finding you, choosing you
Loving you, losing you, after searching all my life
We're getting caught in the static, our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic, I still wanna have it
There's no going back to that life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful, I think you're an angel
With the face of my children, I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through, I was missing you
If love is incarnate and not just a feeling
Then I'm staring right at it, and not at the ceiling
I said something stupid instead of "I love you"
I guess I was nervous of what I'm falling into
Into you and out my mind
I want this before I'm out of time
Into your arms and out my chest
I give you my heart and all of the rest
We're getting caught in the static, our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic, I still wanna have it
There's no going back to the life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful, I think you're an angel
With the face of my children, I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through, I was missing you (I was missing you)
My whole life through (my whole life through)
I was missing you (I was missing you)
My whole life through (my whole life through)
I was missing you (I was missing you)
My whole life through
