Song Name: Peter Pan Was Right
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I'm soarin'
And then straight on to the morn'
I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
Just a lost boy in a small town
I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out but I don't know how
Wish that I was young, what have I become?
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friends with my shadow
And I play him all my sad, sad songs
And we don't talk but he sings along like
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh
Fairytales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do?
Mmm-mm-mm
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brightеr days
Find the second star, I'm soarin'
Then straight on to thе morn'
I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel 18, but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turn back time to a storyline where
My mom read me a tale where
A couple kids, one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green, I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream wasn't meant to be like
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh
Fairytales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do?
Mmm-mm-mm
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I'm soarin'
Then straight on to the morn'
I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
And I don't care if I never land
'Cause the distant sky's always better than
My life right now and the place I am
So for one last time, I guess Peter Pan
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I'm soarin'
Then straight on to the morn'
I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
