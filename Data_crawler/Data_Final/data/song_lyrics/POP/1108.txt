Song Name: Start Walking
Imagine how good you could feel right now
If I was a stranger
Instead of your baby
We're scary good at lettin' each other down
If I cut the chains, yeah
You might thank me later
Yeah, we both know
What we both need to do
But we just don't want to, mmm
Say the words, no one wants to say the words
We're holdin' on to nothin'
But nobody here is talkin'
Say the words, either way it's gonna hurt
We're starin' at the problem
But somebody's gotta start
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (oh), walkin'
(Start) walkin'
Imagine we woke up in different worlds
With no one to bite back
Maybe you'd like that
I ain't scared of feelin' loneliness
I'm scared of watchin' my life past
While I make somethin' bad last
Yeah, we both know
What we both need to do
But we just don't want to, mmm
Say the words, no one wants to say the words
We're holdin' on to nothin' (oh, nothin')
But nobody here is talkin'
Say the words, either way it's gonna hurt
We're starin' at the problem (the problem)
But somebody's gotta start
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (walkin')
Walkin'
I don't wanna hurt you
Don't wanna hurt you
But somebody's got to
Got to
Say the words, no one wants to say the words
We're holdin' on to nothin' (holdin' on to nothin')
But nobody here is talkin'
Say the words, either way it's gonna hurt
We're starin' at the problem
But somebody's gotta start (gotta start walkin')
Walkin'
I'm walkin' away (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (oh), walkin'
Walkin'
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin' (I'm walkin' away)
Walkin', walkin'
Walkin'
