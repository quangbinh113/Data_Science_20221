Song Name: The Hardest Part
I thought that everybody gets older
But I guess that's not the case
'Cause you said goodbye to your family last night
You were only 28
And the year is gonna get a lot colder
But you'll always be stuck in June
When the trees turn red, will it hit me then
That I'm not gonna see you soon?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I never said goodbye, and now it's sinking in
That the last time I saw you, we were kids
I guess the hardest part of getting old
Is that some people that you love don't
Yeah, I thought that everybody gets better
But I guess that's not the truth
Took a drive last night, tried to clear my mind
But I turned the whole highway blue
Yeah, I cried when I read
The last text that you sent
'Cause I'll never see those three dots there again
I never said goodbye, and now it's sinking in
That the last time I saw you, we were kids
I guess the hardest part of getting old
Is that some people that you love don't
And I don't know what to
Say to your little brother
Who am I to say, "It's gonna be okay"?
My mom is friends with your mother
Catching up is never gonna be the same
No more texts on your birthday
Every time another friend says your name
No, I don't know what to say
I never said goodbye, and now it's sinking in
That the last time I saw you, we were kids
I guess the hardest part of getting old
Is that some people that you love don't
I wish I would have tried harder to stay in touch
I thought we had more time, too busy growing up
I guess the hardest part of getting old
Is that some people that you love don't
(Some people that you love don't)
(Some people that you love don't)
