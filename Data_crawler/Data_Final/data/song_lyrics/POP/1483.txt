Song Name: messy in heaven
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out
Then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
B-b-barefoot on the pavement
He was never complacent
Held his ground for the town and the statement leader
Never backs out of the arrangement
Speaks out to the whole crowd when he saves them
But, he was the one that needed saving
Now he's low-key crushed on the inside
He gave his all and now he's breaking
You can see it in his eyes
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out
Then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
He's staying out on the weekdays, weekends
No sleep for the weak 'round here
Going out, getting lost in the deep end
White lines never dried no tears
He says no more, now he says no less
And the people wanna know where he goes next
Mind of a saint so he knows best
But he don't sleep, nah, he don't rest
Turning water into wine
That's mad, that's mad
Everybody always wants what he has
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out
Then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out
Then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
Gets a little messy in heaven
