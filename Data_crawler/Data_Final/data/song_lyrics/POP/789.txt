Song Name: Oh Why
Fold the letter
Wait for you to open
How I wish you could understood
My mind has been lost in words
And here I start again
Pretend to walk away from you
Don't wanna be alone again
All I want is to get close to you
Do you feel how all this could be
We used to hold it gently, gently
And every time you look back at me
I hear your voice quietly, quietly
Oh why, oh why
What's inside your heart?
And I've been trying so hard to realize, realize
I know I still believe in love
The silent crystal speaks no extra conversation
When it lights up like saying hello
It's what it meant to be
Here I start again
Pretend to walk away from you
Don't wanna be alone again
All I want is to get close to you
Do you feel how all this could be
We used to hold it gently, gently
And every time you look back at me
I hear your voice quietly, quietly
Oh why, oh why
What's inside your heart?
And I've been trying so hard to realize, realize
I know I still believe in love
Do you feel how all this could be
We used to hold it gently, gently
And every time you look back at me
I hear your voice quietly, quietly
