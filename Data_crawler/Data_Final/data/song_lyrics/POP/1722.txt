Song Name: Mad at Disney
I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
Had me wishing on a shooting star
But now I'm twenty-something
I still know nothing
'Bout who I am or what I'm not
So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Finding a true love's kiss is bullsh-
'Cause I felt sad love, I felt bad love
Sometimes happy love (happy love)
Turns into giving up (giving up)
I felt hurt love 'bout the word love
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
(Carry me away to a castle)
(Where we will live happily ever after)
My fairy grandma warned me
Cinderella's story only ended in a bad divorce
The prince ain't sleeping when he takes his sleeping beauty
To the motel on his snow white horse
So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Finding a true love's kiss is bullsh-
'Cause I felt sad love, I felt bad love
Sometimes happy love (happy love)
Turns into giving up (I'm giving up)
I felt hurt love 'bout the word love
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
No more wishing on a shooting star
