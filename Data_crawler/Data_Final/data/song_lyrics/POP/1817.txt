Song Name: Fall Into Me
The day that I met you
The world had just spit me out
On my way to the bottom
Sure I'd never be found
Then you saw me for me
Made me believe in myself
On the day that I met you
It all turned around
You said, "Close your eyes
Don't look down"
Fall into me
And I'll catch you darlin'
We'll dance in the street
Like nobody's watchin'
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life
From now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again
Until I had met you
There was no sun in my sky
No mirrors for monsters, and
No love in sight
Then you walked down those stairs
And I knew my heart wasn't mine
On the day that I met you
My whole world came alive
You said, "Close your eyes
I got you now"
Fall into me
And I'll catch you darlin'
We'll dance in the street
Like nobody's watchin'
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life
From now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over
Fall into me
And I'll catch you darlin'
Let's dance in the streets
Like nobody's watchin'
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life
From now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again
Fall into me
And I'll catch you darlin'
Let's dance in the streets
Like nobody's watching
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in our heads
