Song Name: Up Top
Ahh... ooh so high
Turn it up
Oh yeah, mmm
Ahh
Met up just the other day
Did you think that i might
Turn my back and run away
You should know it's not my ordinary
And not my everyday kind of way
But can i take a leap with you
Take a leap with you now
When it's rocky i'll make it smooth (i'll make it smooth)
If there's room for two
Take a leap with you now
Oh yeah, and i wanna know
Can we get any higher?
Can we get any higher?

Let the intimate design to be true
And i hope your mother doesn't mind
And i know, yeah this could be the reason
And i put my everyday's try'na say
Heck, can i take a leap with you?
Take a leap with you now
When it's rocky i'll make it smooth (i'll make it smooth)
