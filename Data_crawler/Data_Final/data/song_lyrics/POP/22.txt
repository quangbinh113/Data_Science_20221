Song Name: Hunter
With one light on
In one room
I know you're up
When I get home
With one small step
Upon the stair
I know your look
When I get there
If you were a king up
There on your throne
Would you be wise enough
To let me go?
For this queen
You think you own
Wants to be
A hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
The unread book
And painful look
The TV's on
The sound is down
One long pause
Then you begin
Oh, look what
The cat's brought in
If you were a king up
There on your throne
Would you be wise enough
To let me go?
For this queen
You think you own
Wants to be
A hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
Let me leave
For the crown
You've placed upon my head
Feels too heavy now
And I don't know
What to say to you
But I'll smile anyhow
And all the time I'm thinking
Thinking
I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
Let me leave
Let me go
