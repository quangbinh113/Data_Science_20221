Song Name: Please Don't Stop The Music
I woke up right beside you
A feeling that's so blue
You know you got me running 'round in circles
Just one night
Every moment you arrive
And you take over my life
Oh baby
Can't live without you baby
I give it up for you
You know I love you
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
We belong together
And that won't change forever
'Cause I love you
I'm just a slave to you
But I just can't stop the groove with you
Don't you walk out that door
You knew from the beginning she'd be there
But I never thought she'd take me over
Baby what did I do
Can't control the rhythm
Oh baby
Can't live without you baby
I give it up for you
You know I love you
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
We belong together
And that won't change forever
'Cause I love you
I don't need to travel far
No need for a miracle
I'm singing in the rain
Got me on a high ya see
Orchestrate my life all year round
'Cause I love this
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
We belong together
And that won't change forever
'Cause I love you
Please don't stop the music
We're making the music
