Song Name: Neighbor
Outside again, and I'll see you later
Up, down I bend just to call you, "neighbor"
Later
Well, I don't know
You said it's too far
And well now I don't know
Whoever you are
You're singing
Do, do, do, do-doo
You're singing
Do, do, do, do-doo
Take five and then
Burn away all your papers
Cut ties or ten
Then go check on your neighbor
I said later
Well, I don't know
You said it's too far
And well now I don't know
Whatever your heart is singing
Do, do, do, do-doo
You're singing
Do, do, do, do-doo
You're singing
Do, do, do, do-doo, do-do-doo
Well, I don't know
You said it's too far
Yeah, well I don't know
Whatever your heart is singing
Do, do, do, do-doo (you're singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (you're singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (you're singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (la la la)
Do, do, do, do-doo (always singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (we're always singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (we're always singing)
Do, do, do, do-doo (we're always singing)
