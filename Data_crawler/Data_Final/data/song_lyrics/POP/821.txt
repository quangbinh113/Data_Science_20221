Song Name: NOT ENOUGH
It's not enough
Not like that
You can't call me out
And then make amends
It's not enough
Understand
You can't take my dreams
And just bring 'em back
Baby, you're my alibi
Hold back
Leave me tonight
Baby, you're my alibi
Hold back
Leave me to dry
It's not enough
Not like that
You can't call me out
And then make amends
It's not enough
Understand
You can't take my dreams
And just bring 'em back
Oh baby, I'll forget about it
I like you more than you know
Maybe I'll forget about it
Baby, I need more than hello
Yeah, yeah, no no
Hey, I've been wanting to call you
I'm sorry for the things I said
Baby, so pick up the phone, dear
I know you're mad just let me live
Let me live, let me live
It's not enough
Not like that (not like that)
It's not enough
Not like that (not like that)
It's not enough
Not like that (not like that)
It's not enough
Not like that (not like that)
