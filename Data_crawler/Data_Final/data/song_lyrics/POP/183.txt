Song Name: Uptown Girl - Radio Edit
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She's been living in her white-bred world (white-bred world)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (hot blood can)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (downtown man)
That's what I am
And when she knows what she wants from her time (time)
And when she wakes up (she wakes up)
And makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I've seen her in her uptown world (uptown world)
She's getting tired of her high-class toys (high-class toys)
And all her presents from her uptown boys (uptown boys)
She's got a choice
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been (I've been)
And then I'll win
And when she's walking she's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love
With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white-bred world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
Uptown girl (uptown girl)
She's my uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
My uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She uptown girl v
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She is my uptown girl (uptown girl)
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She is my uptown girl (uptown girl)
