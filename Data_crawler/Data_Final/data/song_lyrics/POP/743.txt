Song Name: Intoxicated Calls
Sky fades away
Everyday is turning gray
A call away
Just to let you hear me say
I'll be there
If you ever want me there
Anywhere
I don't wanna be elsewhere
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
I don't mind
If you never want to share
But what is mine
You can have it anyway
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
What if us
Be more than just a while?
Maybe I
Don't have to be you while
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
Baby, I
Don't want to watch you cry
Call me when you're drunk and out
I'll be there when you rang up
