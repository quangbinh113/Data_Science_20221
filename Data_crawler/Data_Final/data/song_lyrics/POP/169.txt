Song Name: 1973
Simona, you're getting older
Your journey's been etched on your skin
Simona, wish I had known that
What seemed so strong has been and gone

I would call you up at a Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by, I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, "Here we go again"
Simona, wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now the rain has gone
Simona, I guess it's over
My memory plays our tune, the same old song
I would call you every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by, I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, "Here we go again"
I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by, I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, "Here we go again"
I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"

And though time goes by, I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by, I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
