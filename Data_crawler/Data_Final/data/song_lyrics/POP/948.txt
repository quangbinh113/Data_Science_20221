Song Name: The Heartburn Song
It's gonna be alright
I told you not to play with that fire
But you just had to give it a taste
And I'm tryna be a friend
But I fear how this'll end
Don't say I didn't warn ya
When you're sweating in the face!
And I know (and I know)
You feel the heat
Oh I can see (I can see)
You're looking for sympathy
And I feel (and I feel)
That you're in deep
But when your heart gets burned
Don't be concerned
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
You tell me not to worry about ya
You say that you are doing just fine
But you're fighting back the tears
And the smoke is in your ears
So next time there's a caution label
You should read the sign!
And I know (and I know)
You feel the heat
Oh I can see (I can see)
You're looking for sympathy
And I feel (and I feel)
That you're in deep
But when your heart gets burned
Don't be concerned
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
You want a tall glass of water
But I heard that makes it hotter
On the bite
You know that all the pain you're feeling
That jalape√±o feeling
Won't be gone 'til you move on
Come on, come on, don't fight!
(Hey) it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright! (It's gonna, it's gonna)
It's gonna be alright! (It's gonna, it's gonna)
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!
