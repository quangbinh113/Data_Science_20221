Song Name: Sayonara Love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Blinded by all the neon light
A taste of a forbidden fruit
That was I
Racing through the Tokyo night
It was over when she walked with a man in a Yakuza suit
Taking love to new undiscovered heights
Some things can't be touched occurs to me
Now when I look back
How foolishly
But the glance of her pearly skin
The look in her needy eyes
Didn't leave me the chance to analyze
You left your mark
Girl of Shinjuku
Sayonara, goodbye my love
Stuck on my heart like your dragon tattoo
Sayonara, goodbye my love
She got up
On my motorbike
We escaped in the shades of dawn
Soon we turned into one in the candlelight
And she melted inside my hands
Wish I'd felt there was something wrong
Didn't know I would pay for her sweet delight
Some things can't be touched occurs to me
Now when I look back
How foolishly
But the glance of her pearly skin
The look in her needy eyes
Didn't leave me the chance to analyze
You left your mark
Girl of Shinjuku
Sayonara, goodbye my love
Stuck on my heart like your dragon tattoo
Sayonara, goodbye my love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Sayonara love
Sayonara, sayonara love
Her name will stay on the tip of my tongue
The girl I left in the land of the rising sun
Forever haunting me down
In my dreams
To forget her is hard as it seems
My geisha queen
You left your mark
Girl of Shinjuku
Sayonara, goodbye my love
Stuck on my heart like your dragon tattoo
Sayonara, goodbye my love
You left your mark
Stuck on my heart
Sayonara, goodbye my love
