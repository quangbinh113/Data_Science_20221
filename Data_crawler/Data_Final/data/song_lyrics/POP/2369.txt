Song Name: dear god
Dear God
Do You hear me when I'm crying? When I doubt
That my soul is worth savin'? Thinking
"I'm not good enough for You to answer, what the -?
Don't You love us all the same?
I've taken more than my share of pain
Can't You hear me say Your name?
Can't You see I've got these
Angel wings
Sewed on to my back with black ribbon
I know You know it hurts my skin
I was just trying to get into Heaven
I've been dying to fit in
Dear God
If I drown myself deep in this holy water
Will it wash away my sins?
I thought You could help me make myself a better daughter
But it hasn't happened yet
I've taken more than my share of pain
Can't You hear me Your say Your name?
Can't You see I've got these
Angel wings
Sewed on to my back with black ribbon
I know You know it hurts my skin
I was just tryin' to get into Heaven
I've been dying to fit in
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (dear God)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (dear God)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Don't You hear me when I cry? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
