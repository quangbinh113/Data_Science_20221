Song Name: All I Need (with Mahalia & Ty Dolla $ign)
Hi
I love the way that I feel when you put your arms over me
(There must be something I could say to make you stay baby)
Hi (hello)
I love the way that you get in the groove when you walk with me
Only me

'Cuz every time I think about it can't stop thinking bout it
You are all I need
You are all I need
Hi
I love thinking of all the kisses you could give me if I came around
(There must be something I could say to make you stay baby)
Oh hi
I love the illumination you bring to all the ordinary things I found
Oh baby
'Cuz every time I think about it can't stop thinking bout it
You are all I need
You are all I need
SO I'll be singing in the starbright
Underneath the moonlight oh
'Cuz I love your smile
And it makes me feel alright
(Alright!)
I will sing it to the sun
You will always be the one for me
Let your love shine down
Let your love shine down
(Wanna make you feel the way you feel the way I do)
YEAH
Let your love
YEAH
Shine for me
YEAH
You will always be the one
For me

'Cuz every time I think about it can't stop thinking bout it
Can't stop thinking
You are all I need
You are all I need
SO I'll be singing in the starbright
Underneath the moonlight oh
'Cuz I love your smile
And it makes me feel alright
(Alright!)
I will sing it to the sun
You will always be the one for me
Let your love shine down
Let your love shine down
SO I'll be singing in the starbright
Underneath the moonlight oh
'Cuz I love your smile
And it makes me feel alright
(Alright!)
I will sing it to the sun
You will always be the one for me
Let your love shine down
Let your love shine down
Let your love shine down
Do you really wanna call my name?
Yeah I really wanna call your name!
Jacob, Mahalia, Ty

We the best alive
When you leave me
I'm all forlorn
When it's time for you to go
Alone to your home
You got me calling out
(There must be something i could say to make you stay baby)
When you leave me
I'm all forlorn
When it's time for you to go
Alone to your home
What will I do without you?
