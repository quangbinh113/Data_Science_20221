Song Name: I Can't Answer That
Little shoes pushing up through the vine
I missed what you say, must've slipped out of time
Staring off to space
Something's playing on your mind
That where you think we headed now
Look you can't hide
Let's take the car, get up above the town
Talk while we sit
Watch the sun shift down the prune ground
All those people down there
They don't know who we are
But when you dropped that question, nothing hits so hard
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I can feel that
No, that's not what you're really asking
How am I meant to react
When better days get so long
When do we lose the night
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I don't know, I can't answer that
Getting home
Pick any road you'd like
I've been there before
I should've warned you to take your time
Waking up in LA like it's under your skin
But I can find the quiet one starts to begin
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I can feel that
No, that's not what you're really asking
How am I meant to react
When better days get so long
When do we lose the night
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I don't know, I can't answer that
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I can feel that
No, that's not what you're really asking
How am I meant to react
When better days get so long
When do we lose the night
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I don't know
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I can feel that
No, that's not what you're really asking
How am I meant to react
When better days get so long
When do we lose the night
'Cause that's not what you're really asking
I don't know, I can't answer that
