Song Name: Halfway
(Go, go)
There was a time that I wanted you forever
There was a time when it all made sense
I'm still hoping that it could get better
Does forever have to come to an end?
And I'm thinkin' 'bout who I'll be without you
In the middle of the bed we made
Now I'm walkin' on the edge when I'm around you
How could love make you feel this way?
Am I too scared to leave?
I'm halfway to lettin' you go
And I'm half brave, but scared of alone
Five years of knowin' that you were the one
Taught me to walk, now I'm ready to run
Run fast out the door
Oh, I'm sorry, but I need more
I can't believe that I'm gettin' this close
Halfway to freedom, I'm halfway to lettin' you go
Time to let, go!
I'm halfway to lettin' you go
Time to let, go!
Halfway to lettin' you go
Got the strength, got the will, got the reason
Got a car with the bags all packed
And I guess I gotta go with the feelin'
But if I go, then I can't come back
Am I too scared to leave?
I'm halfway to lettin' you go
And I'm half brave, but scared of alone
Five years of knowin' that you were the one
Taught me to walk, now I'm ready to run
Run fast out the door
Oh, I'm sorry, but I need more
I can't believe that I'm gettin' this close
Halfway to freedom, I'm halfway to lettin' you go
Time to let, go!
I'm halfway to lettin' you go
Time to let, go!
Halfway to lettin' you go
Got the strength, got the will, got the reason
Got a car with the bags all packed
And I guess I gotta go with the feelin'
But if I go, then I can't come back
I can't come back
I'm halfway to lettin' you go
And I'm half brave, but scared of alone (scared of alone)
Five years of knowin' that you were the one (you were the one)
Taught me to walk, now I'm ready to run (ready to run)
Run fast out the door
Oh, I'm sorry, but I need more (but I need more)
I can't believe that I'm getting this close
Halfway to freedom, I'm halfway to lettin' you go
Time to let, go!
Time to let
I'm halfway to lettin' you, go!
Time to let, go!
Time to let
I'm halfway to lettin' you
