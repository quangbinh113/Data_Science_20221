Song Name: Lose Your Love (with Matt Maeson)
All the nights I was drowning in the rain
Hold my breath, tell myself I would see you again
Let the storm blow over for better days
Looking back, never knew what I left behind
Find it hard, the view changes all the time
I was always yours and you were always mine
'Cause I needed space, my heart to break
'Cause giving you up was my greatest mistake
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
To know I couldn't live without it
I see your face in the moment I feel lost
'Cause I lost my way and I feel the fault
All I wanna say is I'm sorry
(Whoa, whoa)
I just needed space, my heart to break
'Cause giving you up was my greatest mistake
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
To know I couldn't live without it
(Whoa, whoa)
It's like the world stands still
Without your love
Nothing's real
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were in the waters drowning
Now I painted over our mistakes
Just trying to find my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
(Whoa, whoa)
It's like the world stands still
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
