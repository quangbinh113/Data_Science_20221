Song Name: Dark Red
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know it, but I feel it coming
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me
Don't you give me up, please don't give up
Honey, I belong with you, and only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you, babe (you)
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
Why I feel this way, I don't know, baby
I think of her so much, it drives me crazy
I just don't want her to leave me
Don't you give me up, please don't give up
Honey, I belong with you and only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you, babe (you)
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you
What if she's fine?
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long
What if (if) she's fine? (Fine)
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just (just) let bad thoughts (thoughts)
Linger for far too long
Don't you give me up, please don't give up
Honey, I belong, with you, only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you, babe (you)
Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
Only you, darling, only you
