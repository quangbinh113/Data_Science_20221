Song Name: Eleven
I know a place
We can go when it's late
And the signs have all turned off
When it's cold, in the dark
There's a place in my heart
For the both of us to stay
But could it be
Could it be
Could it be it's just
The memory of your face
Be that i can't let it go to waste
Be it's just the memory of your face
Be that i can't let it go to waste
But could it be
Could be
Could it be it's just
The memory of your face
Be that i can't let it go to waste
Be it's just the memory of your face
Be that i can't let it go to waste
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
