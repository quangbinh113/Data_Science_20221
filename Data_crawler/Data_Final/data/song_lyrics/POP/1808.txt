Song Name: drivers license - Spotify Singles
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
And today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everythin' I'm insecure about
But today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
But today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh, ooh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean ￼what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, ￼now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe, ooh-ooh
Yeah, sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We're laughing, over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe, yeah

I know we weren't perfect, ￼but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, ￼now I drive alone past your street
