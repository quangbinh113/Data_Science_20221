Song Name: Without Us
I bet we've been together for a million years
And I bet we'll be together for a million more
Oh, its like I started breathing on the night we kissed
And I can't remember what I ever did before
What would we do baby without us?
What would we do baby without us?
And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through
What would we do baby without us
Sha-la-la-la
If its absolutely perfect, the last puzzle piece
And it all just comes together, like we had it planned
Ooh, its like we shared a secret we could never tell
'Cause no one else but you and me could understand
What would we do baby without us?
What would we do baby without us?
And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through
What would we do baby without us
Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number
And I know you know it
And I'm sticking with you till the end
Ooh, I'm in trouble
If I ever lost you
I'd spend my whole life looking for you again
You've got my number
You've got my number
You've got my number
What would we do baby without us?
What would we do baby without us?
And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through
What would we do baby without us
Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number
You've got my number
You've got my number
Ooh-hoo
Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number
You've got my number
You've got my number
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number
You've got my number
You've got my number
