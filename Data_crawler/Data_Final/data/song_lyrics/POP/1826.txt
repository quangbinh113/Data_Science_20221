Song Name: crutches
Hello my friend
It's getting harder to pretend
That the seasons always change, but never end
I was only ten
When I learned that love depends
On the time it takes for broken hearts to mend
Forget me, let me down
Either way I'll always be around

When I'm old & holding crutches on one knee
I'll care for you
Will you care for me?
When you're tired eyes are turning 83
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me?
I hate to ask
I tried to put you in the past
Harmless fun & cutting class
It never lasts
Well, I want more
Than coming over when you're bored
You're the only one I can't ignore
Forever yours
When I'm old & holding crutches on my knee
I'll care for you
Will you care for me?
When you're tired eyes are turning 83
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me?
I'll care for Yo-u-u-u-u-u
Will you care for m-e-e-e-e-e
When you fall asl-e-e-e-e-e-p
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me?
When I'm old & holding crutches on one knee
I'll care for you
Will you care for me?
When you're tired eyes are turning 83
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me?
Forget me, let me down
Either way I'll always be around
