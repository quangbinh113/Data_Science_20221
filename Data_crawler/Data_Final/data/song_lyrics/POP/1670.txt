Song Name: First Class
Uh
I been a (G), throw up the (L)
Sex in the (AM), uh-huh (O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (first class, up in the sky)
I could put you in (first class, up in the, up-up in the)
I been a (G), throw up the (L)
Sex in the (AM), uh-huh (O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (first class, up in the sky)
I could put you in (first class, up in the, up-up in the)
I could see the whole city from this balcony
Back in 2019, I was outside freely, but now they got it out for me
I'on care what frat that you was in
You can't alpha me, keep dreaming
Pineapple juice, I give her sweet, sweet, sweet semen
I know what they like, so I just keep cheesing
Hard drive full of heat seeking
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it
You 'on't need Givenchy, you need Jesus
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons
Uh, I got plaques in the mail, peak season
Shout-out to my UPS workers making sure I receive 'em
You could do it too, believe it
I been a (G), throw up the (L)
Sex in the (AM), uh-huh (O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (first class, up in the sky)
I could put you in (first class, up in the, up-up in the)
(Are you ready?) Ha, yes I am
They say, "You a superstar now", damn, I guess I am
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am
Okay, I'll confess I am
Go ahead and get undressed, I am
Okay cool, you on Sunset (I am)
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay
This lifestyle don't got many downsides
'Xcept for the lack of time I get 'round my
Family, making sure they never downsize
I got visions of my mom saying, "Wait, this house mine?"
Can't lie, I'm on Angus Cloud nine
I got 'em on the bandwagon now, 'bout time
I ain't even got no downtime
Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine"
I been a (G), throw up the (L)
Sex in the (AM), uh-huh (O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (first class, up in the sky)
I could put you in (first class, up in the, up-up in the)
I been a (G), throw up the (L)
Sex in the (AM), uh-huh (O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (first class, up in the sky)
I could put you in (first class)
