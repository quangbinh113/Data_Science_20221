Song Name: My Name
(You don't know me, you just know my)
Pardon my French
I just had to say
That you're gonna hurt yourself
If you're coming for me
You're playing with fire
Like you're not afraid
Assuming that I can't tell
You're gunning for me
Running your mouth, running your mouth
This is not the place or time
Hell no, let yourself out now
I'm crazy
Watch it, I'm not someone to mess with
Say it was a game, you lose, I win
Now you don't know me, you just know my
Walk in, they're whisper and then talking
'Bout this and who I'm friends with
Ain't it funny? You don't know me, you just know my name
Oh, you got an ego
Got something to say
You're doing the most, the most for a minute of fame
I'm never the one to make a scene
But you make it difficult for me
Now I can't stop it
You got what you wanted
You keep on running your mouth, running your mouth
This is not the place or time
Hell no, let yourself out now
(I'm crazy)
Watch it, I'm not someone to mess with
Say it was a game, you lose, I win
Now you don't know me, you just know my
Walk in, they're whisper and then talking (Shh)
'Bout this and who I'm fuckin'
Ain't it funny? You don't know me, you just know my name
You love to hate somebody
Oh, you can keep it coming
It's just amusing to me
I think it's really funny
I know you really love me
You're so amusing to me
You don't know me, you just know my
Name
