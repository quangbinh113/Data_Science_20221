Song Name: Art of Survival
I couldn't stay away, an obvious mistake
I could've saved some face
I thought I knew
That in this painful place
I might find some grace
But mercy is a lie they tell you
I can't read my minds in pieces
I'm still breathing
Now just seeing
The trouble
In doubt
It always lead you into
Or out
Afraid that you can't climb higher
Scared that your gonna fall
Every time the road gets harder
The Art of Survival
How can I fly with eagles
Scared I'm gonna hit the wall
Today I woke up a fighter
The Art of Survival
The Art of Survival
The Art of Survival
Dreams get poisoned in your brain
Yeah, the enemy's the same
Deadly weapons that are formed against you
And your obvious mistake, it cuts just like a blade
Hearing all the friends you made say they made you
Trouble
In doubt
It always lead you into
Or out
Afraid that you can't climb higher
Scared that your gonna fall
Every time the road gets harder
The Art of Survival
How can I fly with eagles
Scared I'm gonna hit the wall
Today I woke up a fighter
The Art of Survival
(The Art of Survival)
(The Art of Survival)
(The Art of Survival)
(The Art of Survival)
The Art of Survival
(The Art of Survival)
The Art of, The Art of Survival
(The Art of Survival)
Maybe I was, maybe I was born a fighter
Afraid that you can't climb higher
Scared that your gonna fall
Every time the road gets harder
The Art of Survival
How can I fly with eagles
Scared I'm gonna hit the wall
Today I woke up a fighter
The Art of Survival
