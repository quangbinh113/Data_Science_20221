Song Name: Ode To My Family
Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
'Cause I spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree
D'you see me?
D'you see?
Do you like me?
Do you like me standing there?
D'you notice?
D'you know?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Does anyone care?
Unhappiness
Where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
'Cause we were raised
To see life as fun
And take it if we can
My mother
My mother she'd hold me
She'd hold me
When I was out there
My father
My father he liked me
Oh, he liked me
Does anyone care?
Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am
I miss you
I miss 'cause I liked it
'Cause I liked it
When I was out there
D'you know this?
D'you know?
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?
Unhappiness
Where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
'Cause we were raised
To see life as fun
And take it if we can
My mother
My mother she'd hold me
She'd hold me
When I was out there
My father
My father he liked me
Oh, he liked me
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
