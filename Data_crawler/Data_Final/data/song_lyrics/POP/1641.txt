Song Name: Return of the Mack
Ooh-oh-oh, come on
Hey, yeah, ay
Well, I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start (do it)
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'm worth
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried
Yes, I tried
You lied to me
Even though you know I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried
Yes, I cried
Return of the Mack
It is (return of the Mack)
Come on (return of the Mack)
Oh, my God (you know that I'll be back)
Here I am
Return of the Mack
Once again (return of the Mack)
Top of the world (return of the Mack)
Watch my flow (you know that I'll be back)
Here I go
So, I'm back up in the game (hustlin' so)
Running things like half my swing (All night long)
Lettin' all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh, oh, oh, oh)
So baby, listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song
You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did
But you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do
But I do, do, do
Return of the Mack
It is (return of the Mack)
Hold on (return of the Mack)
Don't you know (you know that I'll be back)
Here I go (return of the Mack)
Oh, little girl (return of the Mack)
Once more, girl (return of the Mack)
Up and down (you know that I'll be back)
Round and round
Ah, Mark
Stop worrying about your big break
You lied to me
'Cause he said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did
But you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do
But I do, do, do
Return of the Mack
It is (return of the Mack)
Come on (return of the Mack)
Oh, my God (you know that I'll be back)
Here I am (return of the Mack)
Once again (return of the Mack)
Top of the world (return of the Mack)
Watch my flow (you know that I'll be back)
Don't you know (return of the Mack)
It is (return of the Mack)
Oh, no (return of the Mack)
Be strong (you know that I'll be back)
Here I go (return of the Mack)
My little girl (return of the Mack)
Ooh ooh, babe (return of the Mack)
Up and down (you know that I'll be back)
