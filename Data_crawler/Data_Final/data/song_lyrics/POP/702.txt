Song Name: TATTOO
You got a tattoo of me
But we broke up
You'd better not regret it
Like you used to do
I loved the smile on your face
You loved the sunshine after rain
You will never feel the same
I'm the one who can't be tamed
Cherish the moment we first met
Collect those pieces of my faith
Don't be so sad, by the way
'Cause there's no time for you to waste
Baby, what do you want from me
I never hate someone I love
You know it is nobody's fault
We've probably did all that we could
I loved the smile on your face
You loved the sunshine after rain
You will never feel the same
I'm the one who can't be tamed
Cherish the moment we first met
Collect those pieces of my faith
Don't be so sad, by the way
'Cause there's no time for you to waste
You got a tattoo of me
But we broke up
You'd better not regret it
Like you used to do
