Song Name: Sexy Eyes
I was sitting all alone
Watching people get it on with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor
Turning moving back and forth
They were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up what did I see
Sexy eyes
Moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down on you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell
And we knew it
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be
Sexy eyes
Moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down with you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down with you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be
Sexy eyes
Moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down on you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
Ooh, sexy eyes
Getting down with you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down with you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes...
