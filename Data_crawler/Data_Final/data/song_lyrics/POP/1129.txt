Song Name: Fancy
We can make it be what we want it to (oh, oh, oh-ooh)
We can make our heads empty as balloons
I can't explain the muscle racing in my chest (huh-ah)
I don't know where I'm going but I know what's next
Oh, I hear sex and candy
Oh, I could keep on dancing
Oh, let's go somewhere fancy
Where we can keep on dancing
We can make it rain what we want it to (oh, oh, oh-ooh)
Wear each other's clothes and attitudes
Lay our bodies in the ground and then we'll rest (huh-ah)
I don't know where I'm going but I know what's next
Oh, I hear sex and candy
Oh, I could keep on dancing
Oh, let's go somewhere fancy
Where we can keep on dancing
I'm feeling that high vibration
Aren't you feeling that?
I'm feeling that high vibration
Aren't you feeling that?
I'm feeling that high vibration
I'm feeling that high vibration
I'm feeling that high vibration
Aren't you feeling that?
Aren't you feeling that?
I'm feeling that high vibration
I'm feeling that high vibration
I'm feeling that high vibration
Aren't you feeling that?
Oh, I hear sex and candy
Oh, I could keep on dancing
Oh, let's go somewhere fancy
Where we can keep on dancing
