Song Name: don't come back
Yeah, if you wanna go ahead and lie to me
Throw it all out now, that's fine with me, uh
If I'm not enough for you, honestly
I hope you don't come back
When you see that I'm better off
When you're all broke down and you're missing us
When you finally figure out just what you lost
I hope you don't come back
I can feel you shutting off now
Like I always expected you would
Stop believing all your friends now
'Cause they all say that you get bored
I feel it
You're about to cut me out your life
I feel it
Just know that there's no second try
Yeah, if you wanna go ahead and lie to me
Throw it all out now, that's fine with me, uh
If I'm not enough for you, honestly
I hope you don't come back
When you see that I'm better off
When you're all broke down and you're missing us
When you finally figure out just what you lost
I hope you don't come back
You can see me shutting off now (off now)
I don't know what else you'd expect
Really thought I knew you so well (so well)
Should've known that's what I'd get
For thinking that you cared at all
I bet you'll blame it on the alcohol again
Don't be acting so surprised when you see there's no second try
Yeah, if you wanna go ahead and lie to me
Throw it all out now, that's fine with me, uh
If I'm not enough for you, honestly
I hope you don't come back
When you see that I'm better off
When you're all broke down and you're missing us
When you finally figure out just what you lost
I hope you don't come back
When you haven't heard from me in forever
Don't come back
When you find out there's nobody better
Don't come back (no, oh)
No, don't come back, ohh
Yeah, if you wanna go ahead and lie to me
Throw it all out now, that's fine with me
