Song Name: I Believe
Blow my mind, blow my mind, blow my mind now
Take me high, take me high, spin me right round
Don't know why, don't know why it's burning me out
I won't get it right
Stay at home all night
Out of sight, out of sight, I'm hiding right now
You're dynamite, dynamite, yeah, I got no doubt
Way too tight, way too tight, I need a time-out
I can't get it right, stay at home all night
I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head yeah
Yes, I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head yeah
Blow my mind, blow my mind, blow my mind now
Every night, every night, I'm on my way down
You're so high, you're so high
My feet on the ground, I can't get it right
All alone tonight
It's been too long, I'm out of time
I'll leave you high and dry
It feels so wrong
You felt so right
Fell out of love tonight
Yes, I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my head, yeah
Yes, I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head yeah
Badadam ah, badadam, badadam
Badadam ah, badadam, badadam
Badadam ah, badadam, badadam
I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
