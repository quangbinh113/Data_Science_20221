Song Name: Rasputin
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes, a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he was also the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
A certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes, a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he was also the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
