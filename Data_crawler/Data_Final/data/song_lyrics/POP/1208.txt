Song Name: OUT OUT (feat. Charli XCX & Saweetie)
Out, out for the night
Why am I on my own on a Friday night?
My friends are on my phone
They keep blowin' up my line (hello)
Send me your location, the Uber's outside (yeah)
Runnin' out of time
If we're going out, out for the night
I'ma meet you down on the floor
Oh, tell me
So, tell me, when you're out, out for the night
We can get it started, let's go, oh
Just watch me dance
Just watch me

(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Why am I on my own on a Saturday night? (Why?)
Send me your location, the Uber's outside
Friends all in the bathroom, so I cut through the line
Runnin' out of time
If we're going out, out for the night
I'ma meet you down on the floor
Oh, tell me
So, tell me, when you're out, out for the night
We can get it started, let's go, oh
Just watch me dance
Just watch me

(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Run it back
I'm saucy, baby, super picky
Who gon' please this pretty kitty?
Got baddies with me, tanned and tipsy
Pass the concealer, gotta hide the hickey
Ooh, DJ, run it back
Tryna go up, where balloon girl at?
Double cup love, in the club, pitch black
Bubblegum butt comin' through this ass
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Hi, I'm Charli, baby (baby, baby)
Tonight, we're goin' out, out
Just watch me
