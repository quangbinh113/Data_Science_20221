Song Name: Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word
Sorry seems to be (hey) the hardest word
Uh-huh
Na-na-na-na-na-na
That's right
What I gotta do to make you love me?
What I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there
What I gotta do to make you want me?
What I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over, babe?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word (that's right)
It's sad, so sad, it's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad, why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
What do I do to make you want me?
What I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad (so sad), so sad (so sad), it's a sad, sad situation
And it's gotten more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad), so sad (so sad), why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me (yeah, yeah)
Sorry seems to be the hardest word (oh yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Sorry
What do I do to make you love me?
What I gotta do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me? Yeah
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
