Song Name: Green Green Grass
Throw a party
Throw a party, yeah
Throw a party
Well, she moves like lightning
And she counts to three
And she turns out all the lights
And says she's coming for me
Now put your hands up, this is a heist
And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive
Load it up when the sun goes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover
Undercover
She said
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
We go together, Adam and Eve
But the girl is so much more than just another apple thief
Yeah, she's a genius (genius), watch and learn
As she sets the world on fire
Just to watch the sucker burn
Load it up when the sun goes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover
Undercover
She said
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Throw a party (hey!)
Throw a party, yeah
Throw a party (woo!)
On the day that I die
Throw a party (hey!)
Throw a party, babe
Throw a party
On the day that I die
Load it up when the sun goes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover
Undercover
She said
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
