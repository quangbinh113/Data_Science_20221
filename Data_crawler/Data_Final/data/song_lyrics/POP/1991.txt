Song Name: Vegas (From the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ELVIS)
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey, ahw, get it, ye
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey
You ain't nothing but a-
Dog, player, I get it
Fraud, player, I get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man (you ain't nothing but a-)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothing but a-
Player getting valeted 'round in that whole whip
Two fingers, set one down on my toes ten
Fueled out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be crying out when I'm corseted
I don't think you gon' make it, do not let me start raging
I'm losing my patience, this ain't staying in Vegas (you ain't nothing but a-)
There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sitting courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sitting first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been, but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat
I ain't playing this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch, but (you ain't nothing but a-)
Dog, player, I get it
Fraud, player, I get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man (you ain't nothing but a-)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
Yeah, yeah, said (you ain't nothing but a-)
I get it, I know you got some other- you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets (you ain't nothing but a-)
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the cleaning my gym
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you living a dream
We can keep that- asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your G's
Count them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talking 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R.I.P. (you ain't nothing but a-)
Dog, player, I get it
Fraud, player, I get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man (you ain't nothing but a-)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothing but a-
Dog, player, I get it
Fraud, player, I get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man (you ain't nothing but a-)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothing but a-
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey, ahw, get it, ye
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey, ahw, get it, ye
Hey, ahw, get it
Hey
You ain't nothing but a-
