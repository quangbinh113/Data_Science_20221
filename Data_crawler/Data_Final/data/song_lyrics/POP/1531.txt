Song Name: Woke Up in Love
Then I woke up in love (woke up in love)
Then I woke up in love
Lately, I've been losin' these nights
One more heartbreak and I'm done with this
Shadows on the ceilin', they don't fight
But I still argue for the hell of it
I'm tryin' my hardest now, I feel you reachin' out
I don't wanna be the one that's always on the edge
You found me all messed up
You found me down on my luck
So lost, but then I woke up in love
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up, thank God I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love (eh)
Then I woke up in love (eh-eh)
Then I woke up in love (eh)
Then I woke up in love (eh-eh)
Then I woke up in love
Sometimes all those dark days, well, they try to find me
But that's when I lean on you
Whatever happens, my trouble's behind me, 'cause
Your love's gonna see me through
Nothing can bring me down, I feel you reachin' out
You're pullin' me back when I'm about to reach the edge
You found me all messed up
You found me down on my luck
So lost, but then I woke up in love
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up, thank God I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love (eh-eh)
Then I woke up in love (eh)
Then I woke up in love (eh-eh)
Then I woke up in love
You found me all messed up (all messed up)
You found me down on my luck
So lost, but then I woke up in love (then I woke up in love)
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up, thank God I woke up in love (then I woke up in love)
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love (woke up in love)
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
