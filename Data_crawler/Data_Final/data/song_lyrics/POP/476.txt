Song Name: Move
Hey, baby, tell me your name
I got a fever for you, I just can't explain
But there's just one problem, I'm a bit old school
When it comes to loving, I ain't chasing you
Ain't waiting, I'm on a roll
You've got to let yourself go
Woah (talk to me)
You know that I've been waiting for you
(And I noticed you too)
Don't leave me standing all by myself
(I won't leave you standing all alone)
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else
(Oh, baby)
Hey, get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (woo)
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move, you move
(Hey) get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (hey)
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move, you move
Oh, silly, why you afraid?
Don't be a big baby, quit playing games
Put your arms around me, you know what to do
And we can take it down low
Woah
You know that I've been waiting for you (for you)
Don't leave me standing all by myself (myself)
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else (no one else)
(Looking at no one else)
Yeah, yeah, oh (looking at no one else)
(Hey, oh) get your back off the wall (oh)
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move, you move
(Hey) get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (yeah)
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move (no), you move
I know that you wanna, but you can't
'Cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move, so move
I know that you wanna, but you can't
'Cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move, so move
Move it, baby, oh
You know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else, looking at no one else
Hey, hey, I'm ready
Hey, boy, come and get me
Don't be scared, show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?
Hey, hey, I'm ready
Hey, boy, come and get me
Don't be scared, show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?
(Hey, hey)
Get your back off the wall (get your back off the wall)
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (hey, hey)
Feeling like it's my birthday (hey, hey)
Like Christmas day came early (hey, hey)
Just what I want, so when we move, you move
Hey, hey, I'm ready
Hey, boy, come and get me
Don't be scared, show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?
