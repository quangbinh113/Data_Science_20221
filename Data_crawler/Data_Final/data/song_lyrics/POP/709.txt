Song Name: Home
What do I have to say to keep you by?
By my side heart is starting to liquify
Need you here to tell me that'll be okay
Married one, lovin' two and now it's three
3 am thinking what if it's you and me
At the end maybe we'll be okay
I know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
In the morning I know that you're comin' back home
Having my own conversations
Hoping you will come and save me
Know that you're comin' back home
In the morning I hope that you're comin' back home
Look at you
Eyes as soft as that ocean blue
Fallin' in
Learn to swim like I never knew
I see it now that eveything will be okay
With no small doses smell of roses
Can't get enough of you
Can't wait to love you
I know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
In the morning I know that you're comin' back home
Having my own conversations
Hoping you will come and save me
Know that you're comin' back home
In the morning I hope that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
Know that you're comin' back home
In the morning I know that you're comin' back home
