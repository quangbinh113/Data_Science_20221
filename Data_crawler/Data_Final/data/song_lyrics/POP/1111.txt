Song Name: NOT SOBER (feat. Polo G & Stunna Gambino)
This from the heart, I said, "I'm on top, on top"
Yeah, yeah
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex-bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my heart, and this the thanks I get?
I still can't believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
No matter how hard I try, memories still livin' deep in my mind
I seen my best friends change colors like the tie-dye
Shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed all my bags and told the devil I'm leaving
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, I can't fold up
Be so sick, you lose a soldier, wanna throw up
I kept seein' all your pictures every time I scroll up
Now when we see a nigga, get him, quick to let that pole bust
Cali cruisin' in that i8 with the doors off
Now we winnin', 'member back then, they never chose us
Now them bitches doin' backbends, givin' throat off
And I keep collectin' backends, 'cause they owed us
I was really tryna find a way up in them streets lost
Don't be in my feelings really, I just be in deep thoughts
And it been fuck the opposition, no, we don't do the peace talk
Foenem come through rockin' shit, and that's a new beat caught
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
I get lost up in my feelings, and it's real
So I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far" (Ohh-oh-ohh)
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mmh
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy, 'cause I hate bein' sober, mmm
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
