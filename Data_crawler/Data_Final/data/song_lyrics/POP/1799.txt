Song Name: Birthday Cake
You called with the news, I thought you were kidding
You were always joking all the time
You kept breathing but stopped living, held it like poison inside
They say everything happens for a reason
But it only makes you mad
'Cause how in the hell can you believe them
When nothing brings her back?
It's hard to know (to know) what she would say
But I think she'd
Want you to live like the world's on fire
Want you to love like hearts don't break (don't break)
Never look down when you walk the wire
Like she made it to 48, still made your birthday cake
All the pictures on the same walls
Looks like she just went to the store
And when you look into the mirror
Does it make you miss her more?
Win or lose, she was always on your side
Never missed a match
And when you see the moon, do you remember?
She loved you there and back
It's hard to know (to know) what she would say (would say)
But I think she'd
Want you to live like the world's on fire
Want you to love like hearts don't break
Never look down when you walk the wire
Like she made it to 48, still made your birthday cake (cake)
(Want you to live)
Oh-oh-oh
(Want you to love)
Oh-oh-oh
(Want you to live, want you to love)
Want you to live like the world's on fire
Want you to love like hearts don't break
Never look down when you walk the wire
Like she made it, she made it, oh-oh
Want you to live like the world's on fire
Want you to love like hearts don't break
Never look down when you walk the wire
Like she made it to 48, still made your birthday cake
