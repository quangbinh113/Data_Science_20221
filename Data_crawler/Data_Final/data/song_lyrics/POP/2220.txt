Song Name: girls like me don't cry
Tell me that you'll keep me safe and
Never let this fade away
I'm hidin' out, so they don't see this part of me
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you'll keep me safe
And never let this fade away
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend that we don't cry
Lost in the city, both eyes wide
Ran right through all my options
Can't seem to keep my eyes both dry
Got tissues in my pocket
I'm sensitive
Prolly wanna duck when I throw a fit
Been through some shit
Wear my heart on my sleeve, so it's hard to miss
Tell me that you'll keep me safe and
Never let this fade away
I'm hidin' out, so they don't see this part of me
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry (cry, baby)
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you'll keep me safe and
Never let this fade away
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend that we don't cry (cry)
They say, "Girl, don't cry" (don't cry)
Try to keep my head up high (up high)
Smile like it's alright
But all I want to do is hide
Gotta let it go (oh)
I don't wanna keep this all inside
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry (oh, no, we don't cry, baby)
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you'll keep me safe and
Never let this fade away
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend that we don't cry
