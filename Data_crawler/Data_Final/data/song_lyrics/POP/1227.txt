Song Name: I Wanna Dip With You
Call me to say goodnight
Kiss me once or twice
I'll never let go of you
Fold me into your arms
Stay with me till it's dark
I'll never let go of you
Bring me to your battleship
I wanna dip dip
Bring me to the waves
Let's get high
Summertime feeling
I wanna dip dip
Dip dip with you
I wanna dip dip
I wanna be with you oooo
Let's get high
Summertime
Ohhh, ahh
(I wanna dip with you)
Bring me brighter skies
Tell me a long goodnight
I'll never let go
Let go of you
Bring me tomorrow
And forever
I wanna feel the
Sun hit with you
Mmmmmm
Bring me to your battleship
I wanna dip dip
Bring me to the waves
Let's get high
Summertime feeling
I wanna dip dip
Dip dip with you
I wanna dip dip
I wanna be with you oooo
Let's get high
Summertime ohhh, ahh
(I wanna dip with you)
I wanna be with you ooooo
Summertime Feeling
I wanna dip with you
Summertime Feeling
Yeah, ahhhh
