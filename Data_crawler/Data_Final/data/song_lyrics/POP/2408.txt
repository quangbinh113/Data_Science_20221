Song Name: Like All My Friends
Turn the music up
'Cause I don't wanna think
I don't wanna think about the room I'm in
If my eyes stay shut
Then I don't have to see
I don't have to see how everybody's
Got someone they're taking home
I don't wanna sound so cynical, but I
Wanna fall in love like all my friends
God, they look so happy
And I know I can be
I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to fix a fight
Kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends
Not a jealous guy
But I got feelings too
I've got myself a missing puzzle piece
We all wanna find
Someone in our youth
Somebody who can make us feel like
Everybody's got someone
And I'm not usually an optimist, but I
Wanna fall in love like all my friends
God, they look so happy
And I know I can be
I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to fix a fight
Kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Fall in love like all my friends
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Fall in love like all my friends
Wanna fall in love like all my friends, no
And I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to fix a fight
Kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends
