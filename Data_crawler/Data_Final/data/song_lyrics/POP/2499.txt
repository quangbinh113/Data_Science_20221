Song Name: Hot In It
It's Charli, baby
TiÃ«sto
You won't see me crying on the bathroom floor
I ain't never coming back for more
Wanna see you walking out that door
Bye-bye, bye-bye
You won't see me begging for a second chance
Say "I need you", 'cause it don't make sense
Boy, you just lost a ten out of ten
Won't lie, lie, lie
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it (hot in it, hot in it, hot in it)
Rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it (hot in it, hot in it, hot in it)
Moving 'til my feet get sore
Hands all on me 'til my dress gets torn
Watch me do it, do it real hardcore
My, my, my, my (my, my, my, my)
You and me, we never, ever made much sense
I'm too independent, no offence
Boy, don't be sad about the things I said
Don't cry, cry, cry
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it (hot in it, hot in it)
We'll be- (hot in it, hot in it, hot in it, hot, hot, hot, hot in it)
Rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it, dropping it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stopping it
I look hot in it, hot in it, I look hot in it
