Song Name: Nonsense
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't leave me alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh"
I don't want no one else, baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (song I wrote)
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me, ooh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know, I'm talking nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-bleh"
And I don't want no one else, baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (song I wrote)
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me, ooh, it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know, I'm talking nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (blah-blah-blah-blah-blah)
Ah-ah
I don't even know anymore
This song catchier than chicken pox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make
