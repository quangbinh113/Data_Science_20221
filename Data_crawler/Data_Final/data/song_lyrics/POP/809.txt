Song Name: If I Saw You Again
Once in a while in a flash of light
I can still see you fading in the light
Tell me
Where are you going
Where have you been
I'd still adore you, if I saw you again
If I saw you
If I saw you again
If I saw you, if I saw you
I would adore you then
Years ago we were here
Now you're a world away
And I've been lost in an empty stare
Thinkin' bout yesterday
I'd adore you if I saw you again
If I say you
If I saw you again (you know I'd love to see you)
If I saw you, if I saw you again
If I saw you
If I saw you again
I would hold you
Never let you go
Trough the endless night
And we'd discover as brand new lovers
What we have is right
If I saw you
If I saw you again (there wouldn't be a shadow hang in' over me)
If I saw you, if I saw you again (I've got so many things to say to you baby)
If I saw you, if I saw you
You know I'd love you then
