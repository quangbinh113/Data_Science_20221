Song Name: How Will I Know
How will I know?
How, how will I know?
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
(He's the one I dream of)
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above, mhm
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough
(Can't seem to get enough)
When I wake from dreamin'
Tell me, is it really love?
Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceivin')
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm askin' you 'cause know about these things
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How, how will I know?
Oh, wake me, I'm shakin'
I wish I had you near me now
(Wish I had you near me now)
Said there's no mistakin', what I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me
How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceivin')
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm askin' you what you know about these things
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How, how will I know?
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How, how will I know?
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me? (How will I know?)
I say a prayer with every heartbeat (hey, how will I know)
I fall in love whenever we meet (ooh)
I'm askin' you 'cause you know about these things (how will I know?)
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
