Song Name: I Don't Really Care
I don't really care
I make trends and forget about 'em
You know I'm still stuntin' through the virals
Word again, beat on acting childish
I'm the biggest bad boy since Wallace
I don't really care
And them twenty cards you rappin' 'bout
I spent that on the Bugatti, actin' out
Two milli', that's what that's about
I don't really care
In case you forgot, in case you forgot
Montana been had the city wylin'
And came through a cold, we down the city island
Sanaa Lathan, Demi Lovato
Iggy and Cabo, bitch, I been viral
I don't really care
Top three, top three, top three snipes
I took a time off, now they got amnesia
Like I ain't do it with an African visa?
Tell my competition, I'll be hit 'em all
And if I stay silent, you'll be gone tomorrow
Couple n- in my styling bar
But I don't really care
Only competition in my city is a chick
Before the 'Gram on, nigga been viral
Now a diamond single on a platinum album
Word to Rod Wave, we started the wave
When you see us, send a bottle of Ace
Commissary took my dawg in the cage (free Max)
I don't really care, been a trend setter
Jackboys came from coke boys
I'm the guy with the sauce, boy
I don't really care
But shout to Travis, that's my dawg
Let's toast champagne like .40
Coke boys like the Ice T
You barkin' up the right tree
They jerk me at the Grammy's
Next year, I'm bringing the three for the family (hey hook up)
I don't really care
Shorty know I get D, been there
I can't lie when I be with her
If she take long, then I'm leavin' her
I don't really care
Stuck for the lobby
It's them coke boys diary
B-, you know my body
I don't really care, ah
We can get ghost in the Phantom
Shawty get loaf in the camera (والله)
They call me Frenchy Montana (والله)
I don't really care, ah (والله)
Montega
Young Salsa
Young wepa (والله)
Ratata (والله)
Coke boy (والله)
You know what it is when you hear that, hanh
Don't check for me if you ain't got a check for me
