Song Name: psychofreak (feat. WILLOW)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak, freak, freak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak sometimes
Trying to get connected, no Wi-Fi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairy tale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard
Sometimes I don't trust the way I feel
On my Instagram talking 'bout, "I'm healed"
Worrying if I still got sex appeal
Hoping that I don't drive off this hill
When we're making love, I wanna be there
And I wanna feel you pulling my hair
And believe the words you say in my ear
Gotta go outside, I need some air
I want to, want to, want to touch you
Want to touch you, but my fingertips are numb
I want to, want to, want to love you
Want to love you, but my chest is tightening up
I want to, want to, want to feel like I can chill
Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone
But I'm not like anyone
Feeling like a psycho freak sometimes
Trying to get connected, no Wi-Fi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairy tale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak, freak, freak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak, freak, freak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Sorry, couldn't focus on the movie
Everybody says they miss the old me
I been on this ride since I was 15
I don't blame the girls for how it went down, down
Thinking out loud, in the bathroom
While my friends laugh on the couch
Wow, moment's gone now
Know you wanna stay, but I think I gotta leave right now
I want to, want to, want to touch you
Want to touch you, but my fingertips are numb
I want to, want to, want to love you
Want to love you, but my chest is tightening up
I want to, want to, want to feel like I can chill
Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone
But I'm not like anyone
Feeling like a psycho freak sometimes
Trying to get connected, no Wi-Fi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairy tale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak, freak, freak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feeling like a psycho freak, freak, freak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
A psychofreak (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
