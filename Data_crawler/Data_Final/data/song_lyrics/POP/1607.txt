Song Name: Unpretty
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if
You can look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
(Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too)
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things?
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me, hey
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
People trippin'
Yeah, you can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if
You can look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if
You can look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too
I'll make you feel unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if
You can look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if
You can look inside you
Be in a position to make me feel so
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
