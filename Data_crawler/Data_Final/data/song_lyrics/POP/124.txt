Song Name: All Falls Down (feat. Juliander)
What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder, too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time
To say F you
What's the point in saying that when
You know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it
Back, but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold
But you take it personal
All these firing shots
And making ground
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go (Go, go)
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine

You're the drug
That I'm addicted to and
I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
(Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out for the better (For the better)
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down (When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down (When it all falls down)
I'll be fine
(Fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and
I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that
