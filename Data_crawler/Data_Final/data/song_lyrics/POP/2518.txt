Song Name: HISTORY
We got so much history
Wrapped up in these memories
We got so much history
I'll never let you go
We tried to walk away
We said that we would change
But now we're back again
Yeah
So many tears and fights
So many fucked up nights
But now I've realised
It's only you
You're the only one that knows me better
Than I do
It's the past that always brings us back together
'Cause we got so much history
Here with you is where I'm meant to be
Even after all the pain, I'd do it all again
'Cause we got so much history
There's been some damage done
But I know you're the one
And there's no going back again
We got some history
But that makes you and me
I know the story ain't over yet
It's only you
You're the only one that knows me better, oh
Than I do
It's the past that always brings us back together
'Cause we got so much history
Here with you is where I'm meant to be
Even after all the pain, I'd do it all again
'Cause we got so much history
We got so much history
Wrapped up in these memories
We got so much history
I'll never let you go
We got so much history
Wrapped up in these memories
We got so much history
I'll never let you go
(So-so much history)
I'll never let you
I'll never let you
I'll never let you go, oh
I'll never let you
I'll never let you
I'll never let you go
All that I know is
We got so much history
Here with you is where I'm meant to be
Even after all the pain, I'd do it all again
'Cause we got so much history
We got so much history
Wrapped up in these memories
We got so much history
I'll never let you go
We got so much history
Wrapped up in these memories
We got so much history
I'll never let you go
(So-so much history)
I'll never let you
I'll never let you
I'll never let you go
