Song Name: Mary On A Cross
We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom
All we got was blues
But through all the sorrow
We were riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go
We were scanning the cities
Walking to greater dues
But besides all the glamour
All we got was bruised
But through all the sorrow
We were riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I had to let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that
We were searching for reasons
To play by the rules
But we quickly found
It was just for fools
And after all the sorrow
We'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I'll never let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a
You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Your beauty never ever scared me
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
