Song Name: City Hunter
Your eyes
Reflecting your heart,
The mirror of my sight,
Just like a crystal sphere
Your lips
Says a wise words,
The source of my hopes,
Just like a whispering wind
A broken glass
Happened just like,
A shattered pieces of my heart
No, I can't put it back
I know it's so hard to left you
When we will in love each other?
Time is pushing me to forget
The love that I had now is falling apart...
Your moves
Trap my eyes sight,
I can't let it pass
Just like breathing air
A broken glass
Happened just like,
A shattered pieces of my heart
No, I can't put it back
I know it's so hard to left you
When we will in love each other?
Time is pushing me to forget
The love that I had now is falling apart
I'm not strong enough to face love,
It will tear my heart in two, oh.
Will it placed with a new one? 'Cause
You are the irreplaceable one...
I know it's so hard to left you
When we will in love each other?
Time is pushing me to forget
The love that I had now is falling apart
I'm not strong enough to face love,
It will tear my heart in two, oh.
Will it placed with a new one? 'Cause
You are the irreplaceable one...
(Outro)
