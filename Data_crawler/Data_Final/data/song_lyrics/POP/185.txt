Song Name: One Of Us
So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
This old world's going to reel and rock
Saints will tremble and cry for pair
For the lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If God had a name what would it be
And would you call it to His face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
What would you ask if you had just one question?
And yeah, yeah God is great
Yeah, yeah God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the Saints
And all the Prophets
And yeah, yeah God is great
Yeah, yeah God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home
Tryin' to make his way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome
Yeah, yeah God is great
Yeah, yeah God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make his way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome
