Song Name: I Ain't Got No Worries (with R3HAB)
It almost killed me
When I was trying to survive
You know I'll pay, oh, yeah
Thought you could keep me
Stepping over every line
Now you miss me, oh, yeah
But I'm letting go
Of the pain
In my chest
Ripping off the chain
When lights turn low
I shape up
And I go out
'Cause I ain't got no worries when I dance
I ain't got no worries when I dance
I just raise my hands up to the sky
To the dawn, I keep dancing on my own
To the beat, on the floor
I ain't got no worries when I dance
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries when I dance
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries
'Cause I'm over the feeling and the fantasy of us
And I believed it, oh, yeah
But you're killing me slowly with all your lies
Lies, so, yeah
But I'm letting go
Of the pain
In my chest
Ripping off the chain
When lights turn low
I shape up
And I go out
I ain't got no worries when I dance
I ain't got no worries when I dance
I just raise my hands up to the sky
To the dawn, I keep dancing on my own
To the beat, on the floor
I ain't got no worries when I dance
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries when I dance (ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries when I dance
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries when I dance
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)
I ain't got no worries when I dance (dance)
