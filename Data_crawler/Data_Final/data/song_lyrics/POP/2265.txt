Song Name: Extremes
What if I told you I loved you?
What if I told you I lied?
Remember all of our hellos
As I tell you goodbye
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
If you see me in a daze
I feel better, outta place
It's true, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't need to be saved
I'm a fucking renegade, uh
(Highs, lows), I got no in between
(Baby, I know), I've been talking in my sleep
(Free-faller), I drown in the deep
(Baby, I know), I go to extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
'Cause, baby, I know I go to extremes
I'm always runnin' on the wire
I'm terrified of peace and quiet
I'm always runnin' on the wire
I fall in love in the middle of the riot
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
If you see me in a daze
I feel better, outta place
It's true, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't need to be saved
I'm a fucking renegade, uh
(Highs, lows), I got no in between
(Baby, I know), I've been talking in my sleep
(Free-faller), I drown in the deep
(Baby, I know), I go to extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
'Cause, baby, I know I go to extremes
(Extremes, extremes)
(Go to extremes)
(Go to extremes)
Baby, I know I go to extremes
