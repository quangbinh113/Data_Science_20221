Song Name: Almost Mature â€˜87
I couldn't say a word to you my baby
I'm feeling a bit shamed and small
Just give me one more chance for love, I promise
Damn it will shine and glow
You've been all around my mind
Are you leaving me tonight?
Don't you ever say goodbye
I'll be on my way to die
I almost get mature
I almost get mature
Now I'm on my own without you baby
I'm still feeling shame and small
Yet all the metaphors withered like roses
Maybe it's time for me to fall
When I look upon the sky
Wonder who would ever cry
For me holding too much pride
For me telling too many lies
I almost get mature
I almost get mature
I almost get mature
I almost get mature
