Song Name: I Got Love
(I got love) I got love for my homies who be rollin' with me
(Play no game) Play no games 'cause ain't nobody playin' with me
(I got love) I got love for my niggas on my family tree
(I got love) Love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon' be down with me (I got game)
I got game 'cause the game was given to me
(Say my name) Say my name 'cause ain't nobody tighter than me
(Give it up) Give it up if you like the way I'm rocking this beat
(I don't know) Know nothin' better, chasin' my cheddar
If you in love with a whore, you ain't never listened to me
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Wah-ooooh

(Captain save) Captain save a hooker 'cause she hangin' on me
(She can't hang) She can't hang 'cause I ain't lookin' fo' a wifey
(Just in case) Just in case I, better take a weapon with me
(And these hoes) Hoes keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
(Run me how?) Run me how 'cause haters they be all in the mix
(And they know) When they goin', ain't gon' get no better than this
(Can't they see?) Can't they see we ain't some niggas they wanna diss?
(D.P.G.) Though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin' with me
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
(Platinum chains) Platinum chains is all you ever see on my neck
(Diamond ring) Diamond rings as long as I can keep her in check
(All the same) All the same as long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
(Then we came) Then we came 'cause the bass'll knock you off of your feet
(Just that deep) Just that deep, I betcha we be movin' ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin' CD

I got love, I got love
I got love, I got love
I got love
