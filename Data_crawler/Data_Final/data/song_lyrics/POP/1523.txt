Song Name: SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM
It's scary letting go
I know, I know, I know, I know
It's hard to be alone
But I know I'll find a way to cope
Yeah, I thought I'd be upset
I thought I'd have regrets
Without you in my head
Ooh, every day's getting better
Now the rain finally let up
Nobody to stress me out
You're someone else's problem now
Really dodged me a bullet
And I can sleep easy knowin'
Knowin' that you're not around
You're someone else's problem now
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
You're someone else's problem now
Nothing's getting overblown
No one's jealous, no one's crying driving home
Yeah, I won't miss the way you lied
And the games you played to get a rise, oh, no
I used to be obsessed
Now I couldn't care less
Ever since you left
Ooh, every day's getting better
Now the rain finally let up
Nobody to stress me out
You're someone else's problem now
Really dodged me a bullet
And I can sleep easy knowin'
Knowin' that you're not around
You're someone else's problem now
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
You're someone else's problem now
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-ooh, ooh
You're someone else's problem
And whoever you find next
Oh, I wish, I wish them all the best
