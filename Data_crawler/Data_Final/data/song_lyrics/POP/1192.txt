Song Name: When Iâ€™m Gone (with Katy Perry)
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like...
Thought it would be easy, easy to forget me
Let go of the memories (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Now your bed is empty
And you're waking up, sweating
I'm still in your wild dreams
Late nights, calling me, calling me
Do anything to keep me close
Well, you should know it's gonna be, gonna be
So hard for you to let me go
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like...
Me on top of you, touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like...
You're chasing the danger, it's just in your nature
Look for me in strangers (ah, ah, ah, ah)
All these pretty faces, no one can replace it
I'm always your favorite
Late nights, calling me, calling me
Do anything to keep me close
Well, you should know it's gonna be, gonna be
So hard for you to let me go
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on (never really gone)
But no one's gonna feel like (no one's gonna feel like)
Me on top of you, touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like me
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
