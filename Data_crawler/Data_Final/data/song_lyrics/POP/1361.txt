Song Name: This Is What It Feels Like
Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence I can't take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound
And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No, I don't even know if I'm alive
Oh, without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Nothing to hold but the memories and frames
Oh, they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown
Somebody save me, I'm going down
And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No, I don't even know if I'm alive
Ohh, without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it down the road with one headlight
No, I don't even know if I'm alive
Oh, without you now
This is what it feels like
