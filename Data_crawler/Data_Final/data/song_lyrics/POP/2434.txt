Song Name: Crying Over You
You don't, you don't care like you used to
You don't want me there like you used to
I keep wasting every night
Waiting for you to say goodbye
But if you won't, you won't, I'll make the first move
I choose crying, over you
I choose silence, over being lied to
I choose drinking alone
Drowning in my tears, in my bedroom
'Cause it'll make me happier than you do
I choose crying over you
You know, you know just how to get me
How to take my love and use it against me
I keep wasting all my time
Trying to make the wrong things right
I hope you like your bed when it's empty
'Cause I choose crying, over you
I choose silence, over being lied to
I choose drinking alone
Drowning in my tears in my bedroom
'Cause it'll make me happier than you do
I choose crying over you
Yeah, I choose crying over you
Yeah, yeah
The truth is, I'll only get over you if
I choose crying, over you
I choose silence, over being lied to
I choose drinking alone
Drowning in my tears in my bedroom
'Cause it'll make me happier than you do
I choose crying over you
