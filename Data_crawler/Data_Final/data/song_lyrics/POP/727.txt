Song Name: Is It The Answer
I make you break
You move I take
Love is the answer so they say
But if I went away
What would you say
Would it be enough to make you stay
As you look to the exit
I don't even know why I'd do this anymore
I know there's things I should know
And I know you can't accept
She's the love that I kept
Scared I'll push you away
But I love you everyday
I know there's things you should know
I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Won't you just stick around with me
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you mislead me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end
I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Wont you just stick around with me
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you mislead me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end
I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Won't you just stick around with me
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you mislead me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end
