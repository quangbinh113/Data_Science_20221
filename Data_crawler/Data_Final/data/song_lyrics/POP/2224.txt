Song Name: Maybe Baby
Whenever I'm feelin' blue
All that I can think about is you
Hearing you laugh (hearing you laugh)
Seein' you smile (seein' you smile)
So bright (so bright, so-so-so bright)
Whenever I'm feelin' down
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know you're by my side (ha-ha)
With you, I will be alright
Oh, boy, you're not a maybe (boy, you're not a maybe)
Oh, you mean so much to me (you mean so much to me)
No matter how far you have to be (how far you have to be)
You're always mine, baby
Hold both of my hands (both of my hands)
And never let it go
You are my missing piece
Whenever I'm feelin' blue (feelin' blue, feelin' blue)
All that I can think about is you
Hearin' you laugh (hearin' you laugh)
Seein' you smile (seein' you smile)
So bright (so bright, so-so-so bright)
And I know that you won't always be there for me
Baby, I don't mind
I want you to achieve your dreams (ah-ha)
When you're with me
Oh, boy, you're not a maybe (boy, you're not a maybe)
Oh, you mean so much to me (you mean so much to me)
No matter how far you have to be (how far you have to be)
You're always mine, baby
Hold both of my hands (both of my hands)
And never let it go
You are my missing piece
I know that you're always with me, baby
I don't mind, you're not a maybe, baby
I know that you're always with me, baby
You're always mine, my baby, oh
Hold both of my hands (both of my hands)
And never let it go
You are my missing piece, oh
Hold both of my hands
And never let it go
You are my missing piece
