Song Name: Sweetest Pie
'Mano
You've never been to Heaven, have you? (OG Parker)
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (yeah, yeah, yeah, ah)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it (yeah)
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Baby, I'm the sweetest, pussy is the meanest
Hot Girl shit, but I'm cold every season
Know he got that pipe, let him bust it 'til it's leaking (yeah, mwah)
Booty like a pillow, he can use it while he sleeping (look)
Don't be going through my phone 'cause that's the old me (old me)
Ain't the only one tryna be my one and only (one and only)
Real thick, moving slow, that body like codeine
He a player (hey, hey, hey), but for Megan, he cutting the whole team
That body looking nice (looking nice)
I got cake and I know he want a slice
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice (brr)
I ain't never had to chase dick in my life (in my life)
I want that nasty, that freaky stuff (freaky stuff)
Live under my bed and keep me up (hey)
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up (ah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive, and you just lay back (ah)
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie
I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud, I got some space for you
Got a taste for you, ayy
Mo' bounce to the ounce
Pick it up, put it down (whoa)
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round (baow)
Pussy tight' than a bitch, he ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they're throwing gang signs on Crip (on Crip)
One thing about me, I ain't taking no shit
He whipped, I know it's pissing off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained (I got his ass trained)
Just tryna let a dawg know who really run things (huh, ah)
You've never been to Heaven, have you?
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive, and you just lay back (ah)
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite (uh-huh, ayy, ayy) of the sweetest pie
Ooh, the ride of your life (Real Hot Girl shit)
(Me and Dua Lipa finna get the party lit) hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite (ah) of the sweetest pie
