Song Name: Beyond Love
Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth
Beyond love
I wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands
Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in this
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it
We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know
The last thing that she sees
Before they turn off all the lights
Was there a man up in the corner
With the spiders made of light
We really wanna know
Beyond love
All I know is what I see
And I can't live without this
Could you ever believe beyond love?
I really wanna know
I really wanna know
