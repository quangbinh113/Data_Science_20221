Song Name: Sorry To Me Too
(I'm sorry to me too)
For ever believin' you and puttin' my trust in you
Well, now I got no reason to
For givin' you everything and lettin' you take it from me
For all the love I wasted on you
Yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me, to me (Too)
Sorry to me, to me (Too)
Yeah, yeah
Sorry to me
You were like God
I was so anointed when I fell for you
And now I'm like, "God"
I'm havin' so much trouble gettin' over you
Yeah, what a fa√ßade
Oh, you kept me warm with all your sugarcoats
I held onto your promises too much
(I'm sorry to me too)
For ever believin' you and puttin' my trust in you
Well, now I got no reason to
For givin' you everything and lettin' you take it from me
For all the love I wasted on you
Yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me, to me too
Sorry to me, to me (Too)
Yeah, yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me
Say you got caught
Up in a suspended reality
Then got scared of what we're not
Leavin' me with all responsibilities
It's funny (It's funny, it's funny)
How I made you all your money (Your money, your money)
Yeah, yeah (It's funny, it's funny, it's funny)
How now that I can't help you don't want me
(I'm sorry to me too)
For ever believin' you and puttin' my trust in you
Well, now I got no reason to
For givin' you everything and lettin' you take it from me
For all the love I wasted on you
Yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me, to me too
Sorry to me, to me (Too)
Yeah, yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me (Mm)
When and if at all, when and if at all in my mind
When and if at all, when and if at all have you not lied?
When and if at all, when and if at all in my mind
When and if at all, when and if at all have you not lied?
I'm sorry, too, oh
Now I got no reason to, oh
I'm sorry, too, oh
Baby, I'm sorry, too-too-too
