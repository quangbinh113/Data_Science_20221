Song Name: Silver and Gold (feat. Sam Fischer & Pink Sweat$)
Can't swim, but I'm not gonna drown
Jump in and I'll figure it out
Stupid, but I'm runnin' my mouth
Like I don't ever doubt what I'm talkin' about
'Cause tonight, I'm gettin' wasted
'Cause we're alive let's celebrate it
Blink of an eye, it could be taken
And even though it took a while
The dance floor's been waitin' up for me
The bright light's my type of therapy
And we're right where we're supposed to be
(And we're right where we're supposed to be)
Everybody come together
When we unite, it's better
We're gonna dance forever
I know that
'Cause we got that fire in my soul
Yeah, my mama told me so
She said that you have to want it
More than silver and gold
Everything you do
Gotta do it with your soul
Let the beat inside
And let the rhythm flow
Ain't no L's, it's all just lessons, let it go like, ooh
Ain't no stressin', it's just blessings, let it flow like, ooh
Dance floor's been waitin' up for me
The bright light's my type of therapy
And we're right where we're supposed to be
(And we're right where we're supposed to be)
Everybody come together
When we unite, it's better
We're gonna dance forever
I know that
'Cause we got that fire in my soul
Yeah, my mama told me so
She said that you have to want it
More than silver and gold
When you try to shout it out
And you don't have a voice
When you wanna do what's right
But you don't have a choice
Just remember
That the road to freedom's paved with many tears
Mmm
You've got to have it
Deep down in your soul
You have to want it
More than silver and gold, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Dance floor's been waitin' up for me
The bright light's my type of therapy
And we're right where we're supposed to be
(And we're right where we're supposed to be)
Everybody come together
When we unite, it's better
We're gonna dance forever
I know that
'Cause we got that fire in my soul
Yeah, my mama told me so
She said that you have to want it
More than silver and gold
