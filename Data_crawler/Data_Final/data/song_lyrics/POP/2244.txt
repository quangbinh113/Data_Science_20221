Song Name: Talking to Yourself
I was always invisible
Consequences are difficult to face
Could've been something beautiful
But you made it impossible to stay
So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind?
What you got on your mind?
Am I keeping you up at night?
Keeping you up at night?
I'll never let you be, no
Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me? (to me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your, talk to me (to me)
When you're talking to yourself?
You were never just miserable
Without taking me with you all the way
Don't it hit you subliminal?
Now that I'm not the only one who's taking the blame
So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind?
What you got on your mind?
Am I keeping you up at night?
Keeping you up at night?
I'll never let you be, no
Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me? (to me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your, talk to me (to me)
When you're talking to your
Are you thinking of me?
Does it kill you that you're thinking of me?
Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me? (to me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your, talk to me (to me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your, talk to me (to me)
When you're talking to yourself
