Song Name: I Think I Like When It Rains
I think I like when it rains

You told me to go to the light
And what it's like to feel your pain
Now I'm okay if you're alright

I start to wonder why I came
I dreamed of things you said to me
We stayed at your place while it rains
We talk and we laugh and watch TV
And I couldn't find the words
I couldn't think of what to say
And all that I can do is stop
And think about the day
When all we used to dream about was meeting after school
And we would go on home and start right back again

I think I like when it rains
Call up some friends and have some fun
Oh Lord, I wish things were the same, nowadays
We'd go back to your place when we're done
And I got nothing else to blame

I wish the words would come to me
We stay at your place while it rains
We party while your mom is asleep
And I couldn't find the words
I couldn't think of what to say
And all that I can do is stop and think about the days
When all we used to dream about was meeting after school
And we would go on home and start back again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I couldn't find the words
I couldn't think of what to say
And all that I can do is stop think and about the days
When all we used to dream about
Was meeting after school
And we would go on home and start back again

We would go on home and start back again
