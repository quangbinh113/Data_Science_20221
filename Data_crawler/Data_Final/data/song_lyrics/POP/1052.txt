Song Name: Lose My Mind (feat. Josh Franceschi)
I've seen it in the motion pictures, it's on the radio
I just never believed it, no, I just never believed it
They tell you someone comes around to fix you, righting all your wrongs
But I just never believed it, no, 'cause I never received it
Maybe I was a pessimist, was a fool
Nothing made me feel like you do
What I'd do just to keep you here in my arms
I'll do whatever it takes
I put my hands in the flames
I'm not gonna lose you tonight
I'd rather lose my mind
You said forever and more
So sick of letting you go
I'm not gonna lose you tonight
I'd rather lose my mind, mind
My mind tonight
I'd rather lose my mind
I know you're tired of promises
I always seem to break
You just have to believe me, yeah
I know I've never been easy, yeah
I know I can get narcissistic and cruel
And I put myself before you
What I'd do to fix everything I've broken
I'll do whatever it takes
I put my hands in the flames
I'm not gonna lose you tonight
I'd rather lose my mind
You said forever and more
So sick of letting you go
I'm not gonna lose you tonight
I'd rather lose my mind, mind
My mind tonight
I'd rather lose my mind
If it meant that I wasn't by your side 'til the day I die
I'd rather lose my mind
If it meant that I wasn't by your side 'til the day I die
I'd rather lose my mind
If it meant that I wasn't by your side 'til the day I die
I'd rather lose my mind
If it meant that I wasn't by your side 'til the day I die
I'd rather lose my mind
