Song Name: How Would You Feel (Paean)
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you

It's just something that I want to do

I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you

Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
