Song Name: Ride It
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
Been about a month and 20 days
And we're going 'round and 'round just playing silly games
Now you're saying slow it down, not right now
Then you wink at me and walk away
Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you
(Ride it) when we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
Movida was the club on Saturday
You're acting like a diva saying you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be your feisty style
Raise that brow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
Reapply your lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song, Kanye's on
Now you're beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, telling me we gotta go
Won't you take me home, I wanna
(Ride it) when we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) when we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
Won't you take me home, I wanna
(Ride it) when we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
