Song Name: Right Person Right Time
What if we just met
We started back at the first text
When you were too shy to talk to me so freely
Before you knew me completely
And what if we left it
Stayed friends and never addressed it
And what if your mum walked in before you kissed me
It would have ended before we had history
The stars aligned
But it wasn't quite right
Now I could call you
But I can't call you mine
And I could have loved you
So much better this time
If we knew what we were giving us
We would have waited and missed the signs
'Cause if it were ten years down the line
You'd be the right person right time
Remember those days when
We'd joke about how we'd moved in
But now we're moving on
I lost a best friend, lost your mum, I lost everything
The stars aligned
But it wasn't quite right
The tears I've cried
Won't pay to get you back in my life
Now I could call you
But I can't call you mine
And I could have loved you
So much better this time
If we knew what we were giving up
We would have waited and missed the signs
'Cause if it were ten years down the line
You'd be the right person right time
What if I shut my mouth
What if you didn't make me cry in the driveway
And what if you choked it down
I'd listen when you talk and I'd only say I'm sorry
Maybe we were better off
Were you everything and I didn't know it?
I'm spiraling out
I'm spiraling out
On these what ifs
On these what ifs
Now I could call you
But I can't call you mine
And I could have loved you
So much better this time
If we knew what we were giving up
We would have waited and missed the signs
'Cause if it were ten years down the line
You'd be the right person right time
