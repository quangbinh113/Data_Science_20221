Song Name: Bad (feat. Vassy) - Radio Edit
I say, "Why does it feel so good
So good to be bad?"

Gettin' what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad? (Huh)
You see, why does it feel so good
So good to be bad?
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am
(Oh baby, here I am)
I say, "Why does it feel so good?"
So good to be bad
I say, "Why does it feel so good
So good to be bad?"
Gettin' what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad? (Huh)
You see, why does it feel so good
So good to be bad?
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am
(Oh baby, here I am)
I say, "Why does it feel so good
So good to be bad?"
