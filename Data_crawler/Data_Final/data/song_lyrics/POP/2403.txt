Song Name: In The Kitchen
When I walk in the kitchen
My heart hits the floor
'Cause' it's you that I'm missing
I still see a vision of us cooking dinner
And you holding me from behind (from behind)
And you say, "Please be careful
The knife is so big
And we can't have another ER trip
We're too young, too dumb, too in love to afford it" (to afford it)
Now it's just me
And a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
Deleted the playlist
But I still hear all your favorite melodies
Strangers, to lovers, to enemies
So I'll dance with your ghost in the living room
And I'll play the piano alone
But I'm too scared to delete all our videos
'Cause it's real once everyone knows
Could've at least shown me some decency
Done me a favor and packed up your clothes
Falling in love, no, it ain't for the weak
So don't try this at home
The couch that we sat on back in New York
Has made its way three thousand miles to L.A
These pillows been talking
Asking me where the hell you've been (where the hell you've been)
Told me you loved me two weeks in
And I knew I would fall for you over and over
But who would've known that the falling would come to an end (come to an end)
But now it's just me
And a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
Deleted the playlist
But I still hear all your favorite melodies
Strangers, to lovers, to enemies
So I'll dance with your ghost in the living room
And I'll play the piano alone
But I'm too scared to delete all our videos
'Cause it's real once everyone knows
You could've at least shown me some decency
Done me a favor and packed up your clothes
Falling in love, no, it ain't for the weak
So don't try this at home
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So don't try this at home
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ain't it funny how time shows you
You know nothing
'Cause I used to love you
But now you're dead to me
Strangers, to lovers, to enemies
