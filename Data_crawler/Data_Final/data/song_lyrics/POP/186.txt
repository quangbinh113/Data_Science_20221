Song Name: When We Were Young
Funny how things just tasted better
When we were young
When we were young
Funny how things just seemed so easy
When we were young
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
I think that we weren't always grateful
For what you've done
When we were young
I think that we weren't always grateful
For what you've done
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
You on the phone
You on the phone
You on the phone
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
I want to feel better
Can't make it alone
I wanna get out
I wanna go home
Is anything better
Than you on the phone?
