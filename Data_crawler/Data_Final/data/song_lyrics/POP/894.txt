Song Name: Alright
Baby, it's you, alright
You everything I want
You better believe that you're the one
It's you, alright
Would you coming spend a time?
I'll be using you'll be mine
Nothing in this whole wide world
Could ever let me down
If you walkin' by my side
Feel like we're on the ground
Rule the world with me
Rule the world with me, baby (baby)
Ain't nothing impossible
No one in this whole wide world
Could tell me otherwise
'Cause you are the one
I've choosen my lady, my former
Rule the world with me
Rule the world with me, baby (baby)
Ain't nothing impossible
