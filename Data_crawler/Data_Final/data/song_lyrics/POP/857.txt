Song Name: Suddenly
Tell me when it hurts
'Cause I can't keep finding out
Tell me when to cry
'Cause I can't keep freaking out
Just what I convinced myself I couldn't live without
Your coincidence, it never seemed to get me down
But
I'll follow into
I'll follow this into the darkness
I'll get what I want
I'll get it all so suddenly, so suddenly
Tell me when the lights start shining down on all our teeth
Point me to an open chair and I'll take a seat
The song keeps playing on
When it stopped I never learn
I keep running on never knowing where to turn
But, I'll never slow down
I'll follow this into the morning
I'll get what I want
I'll get it all so suddenly, so suddenly
I'll get what I want
I'll get it all so suddenly
I'll get what I want
I'll get it all so suddenly, so suddenly
