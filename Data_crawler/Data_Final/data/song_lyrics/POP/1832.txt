Song Name: Sunday Crossword
(You keep repeating the same word)
(It's just, it's full of consonants)
(It's the same word)
When I was a kid I always imagined
The person I'd fall for would be good with their mouth
And all the best phrases
Would always fall out (what's one down? run away to elope)
We'd walk to get coffee on Sunday morning
Then we'd do the crossword and sit on the couch
It's kinda ironic - that's what we have now
We said we wouldn't let it
But somehow this got serious
And you sound so poetic
Saying we're so far from love
You can't say it to my face so
We just try and fill these spaces
What's a nine-letter word for how you feel?
There's a "u" and "i" together, but it's missing a few letters
Is it "misguided" or "disguised" as something real?
It can't be "unrequited"
Cause my feelings are too big
There's so much I wanna tell you
But I don't know if it'll fit
I'm not a kid so now I can read all
The signs that you give and into silence between us
There's so much we're leaving unsaid
So give me a pen and I can pretend
That we're writing our future instead of playing
And all these games trying to break the rules
We said we wouldn't let it
But somehow this got serious (this got serious)
And I might sound pathetic
But doesn't this look just like love?
I can't say it to your face so
I hope you can fill the spaces
What's a six-letter word for what I want?
There's an "over" in the center
But I know that's not the answer
Under "covers" I might never call it "love"
But it's spelled out so clearly
The more you look at it
There's so much I wanna tell you
But I don't know if it'll fit
Ooh
It all leads back to you
(You know the words, can you say 'em first)
(Fill the spaces, I'll be patient)
Ooh
It all leads back to you
(You know the words, can you say 'em first)
(I always imagined, I couldn't have grasped it)
When I was a kid I never imagined
That love would be so hard to figure out
It's kinda ironic - that's what I have now
