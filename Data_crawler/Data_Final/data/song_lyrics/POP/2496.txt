Song Name: JUMPSTART
(Bum-bum-bum-bum)
You wouldn't be here if your heart was right
You got your reasons why and I got mine
I knew the moment you walked through the door
I knew exactly what I came here for
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
I wouldn't bе here if my head was right, yеah
You kissin' me, but you can't say my name, yeah
Oh, I can promise that I'm here to stay
But trust me, you'd be better off that way
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
You're my secret escape
I feel it, do you feel the same?
I'm needin' a spark in my veins, my veins, my veins, yeah
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
Jump-start my heart, make it bump, pump the throttle
Just a shot in the dark, take a sip, take the bottle
If I told you today I'll be gone by tomorrow
Would you jump-start my heart, make it bump?
Bum-bum-bum-bum
