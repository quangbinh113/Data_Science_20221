Song Name: Every Beginning Ends
You went to sleep without saying you love me
I guess I thought you already knew
You've been so cold and far from me, darlin'
Someone's at fault, but I'm not blaming you
I can't remember the last time you touched me
I can't recall you making the move
Doesn't seem all that long ago, darlin'
We'd go a whole weekend and not leave our room
You have to wake up every morning
And choose to love someone
But I'm finding that harder the more that I'm falling out of love with you
You used to kiss me without a reason
No one's made me laugh like you do
We had some good times, didn't we, honey?
But now, every beginning has ended with you
You have to wake up every morning
And choose to love someone
But I'm finding that harder the more that I'm falling out of love with you
That I'm falling out of love with you
