Song Name: Teenage Blue
Oh, you and I
Held our hands, told the time
Oh, you and I
Is it the way you and I wait
My only, my only you
Oh, you and I
Is it the way you and I stay
Oh, you and I
In my mind, you were mine
My only, my only you
All that I'd ever see all that I'd ever believe is through
All that I'd ever see all that I'd ever believe is blue
Oh, you and I
Held our hands, told the time
Oh, you and I
It's all the same now
You were mine
My only, my only you
