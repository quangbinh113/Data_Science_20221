Song Name: Iâ€™m Tired (with Zendaya) - Bonus Track
Hey, Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey, Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey, Lord, you know I'm tired of tears
Hey, Lord, just cut me loose
Hey, Lord, you know I'm fighting
Hey, Lord, you know I'm fighting
I'm sure this world is done with me
Hey Lord, you know it's true
Now the tide is rolling in
I don't wanna win
Let it take me, let it take me
I'll be on my way
How long can I stay?
In a place that can't contain me
Hey, Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey, Lord, you know I'm trying
Hey, Lord, you know I'm trying
It is all I got, is this enough?
Hey, Lord, I wanna stay
Hey, Lord, you know I'm fighting
Hey, Lord, you know I'll find it
I don't know when or how, today
Hey, Lord, I'm on my way
