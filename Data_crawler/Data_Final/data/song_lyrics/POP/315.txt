Song Name: Can't Remember to Forget You (feat. Rihanna)
I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now, you a part of me
So where you go, I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooh

I go back again, fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now, he a part of me
So where he goes, I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'd do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'd do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I do anything for that boy
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
