Song Name: that way - with Jeremy Zucker
Run me in circles like you always do
Mess with me on purpose, so I'll hang on to you
I know what you mean when you act like that
But you don't know it's breaking my heart
Said that it was just never gonna happen
Then almost kissed me in the dark
Every time we talk, it just hurts so bad
'Cause I don't even know what we are
I don't even know where to start
But I can play the part
We say we're friends, but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
Still can't tell
If we both mean well
Keep me guessing
If this is life or hell
Think I might've said too much, bit the dust
Now I'm kinda dizzy
Overthinking us, until I'm drunk
And sick of this whole city
Don't know where to start
Don't know how to hold my heart
And if we're really what we say we are, then why is this so hard?
We say we're friends, but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way (ah)
Friends don't look at friends that way, mm, hey
We say we're friends but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
