Song Name: San Francisco Street
Lost on the freeway
Well, this must be LA
Tired and lonely
With no real place to stay
Is this the future and where I'm gonna be?
Last night it hit me
When I had this crazy dream
Of waking up
In your house
On a San Francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
You were intriguing
Just looking at a magazine
Like when I first saw you
Back in 2003
Then you walked over
Said, "You don't have to be alone"
I don't have a crystal ball
There's no way that I could've known
I'd be waking up
In your house
On a San Francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
Waking up
In your house
On a San Francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you
All in front of you and me oh, oh
Yeah
Waking up
In your house
On a San Francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
Waking up
In your house
On a San Francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
Then it's all in front of you
All in front of you and me
San Francisco street
You and me
It's all in front of you and me
You and me
San Francisco street, you and me
Oh, oh
