Song Name: you'd never know
You'd never know
I was fighting for my life eight months ago
I shut the door and covered the windows
'Cause the sunlight hurt my eyes
I couldn't even go outside for so, so long
And you couldn't tell
But the inside of my head was a living hell
I tried my best explaining how it felt but nobody ever understood
Doctor said that everything looks good
So, I blamed myself
I don't think I've ever been so lonely
Didn't know if I would make it out
The dead of the winter of my life
In the middle of the summertime
And it still haunts me now
But you'd never know
That it took me months just to step outside alone
'Cause my body still gets tense when I walk home
Past the spot where it all went dark
It's like a movie flashing back in parts
That cuts deep and slow
Oh, I don't think I've ever been so lonely
Didn't know if I would make it out
The dead of the winter of my life
In the middle of the summertime
And it still haunts me now
Everyone said, "You look fine from the outside"
But in my mind, I was upside down and screamin'
"What the hell is wrong with me?" Oh
Trying to make it make sense, makin' my head spin
Now I pray to forget
'Cause I'm still here screamin'
"What the hell is wrong with me?"
But you'd never know
Oh, you'd never know
No, no
