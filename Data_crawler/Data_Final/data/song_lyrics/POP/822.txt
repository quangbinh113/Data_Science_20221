Song Name: Silly Little Thing (feat. Sore)
Raining out on Sunday
A lazy funny calm day
Laying down on some fun times as well
You slowly come to my sense
Our time has come to be friends
The sun is sliding up for some love dance
You are so fine
Just like
Eveybodys waltzing watching the raindrops
Silly little thing that you are
And Im so glad youre mine.
You make me
Walking on side arms frolic some sweet flaunts
Silly little thing that you are
Silly little thing that you are boy
Fancy everything that youve got dear
Every little thing u desires waiting for you
So now the fun is out there
Such a flaming escapade
The sun is setting up for the game to play
Raining out on Sunday
Lazy funny calm day
The moon is sliding out for some more love dance
