Song Name: Don't Break the Heart
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
I'm sitting here in this lonely room
No, there's nothing left, it's only me and you
Holding onto heaven
But the heavens closed down on me
Nothing lasts forever, nothing goes to plan
Don't you lose your grip, you're letting go of my hand
'Cause every single second
Is a second that we can't get back

Here we go, growing cold in the silence
Never know 'til you hear all the sirens
I should go but if this is the end of the line then
Hold me close
And we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
One minute you're here then you're gone the next
Turning into strangers like we never met
Counting every blessing
Like a lesson that you taught me, me, me
Here we go, growing cold in the silence
Never know 'til you hear all the sirens
I should go but if this is the end of the line then
Hold me close
And we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
That's loving you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
That's loving you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
That's loving you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
Here we go, growing cold in the silence
Never know 'til you hear all the sirens
I should go but if this is the end of the line then
Hold me close
And we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart
That's loving you
I'm sitting here in this lonely room
No, there's nothing left, it's only me and you
Holding on to heaven
But the heavens closed down on me
