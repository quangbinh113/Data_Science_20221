Pull up inna the Cartier
I nah watch nobody but you
Pull up inna the Lada
But me have the Benz and the Prada
And a couple brand-new other
Whole a dem full, it don't matter
Zero to a hundred in two
Yeah, so me flex 'pon you
All inna my section view
Eyes set 'pon you
Then me get a text come through
So me show you wa me Lex' can do
