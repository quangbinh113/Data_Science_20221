Song Name: Paradise... How Far?
Lie down by my side
Beneath the perfect sunshine
And the blue sky
Will throw us back to the time
Like one of those lovely nights
In the diamond starlight
How crazy years have flied
Oh, how far are we to paradise?
Life's been fairly easy, guess I shouldn't cry
Yet sometimes it's hard to say I'm fine
The moment that I wait on, is like one with you now
Tender is the smile, I'll write it in my song
So stay here by my side
Beneath the perfect sunshine
And the blue sky
Will throw us back to the time
Like one of those lonely nights
In the diamond spotlight
How crazy years have flied
Oh, how far are we to paradise?
I always felt like a misfit, guess I didn't try
You say it's alright, we're all alone sometimes
I don't deserve a moment like one with you now
But how can it be wrong? I'll write it in my song
So stay here by my side
Beneath the perfect sunshine
And the blue sky
Will throw us back to the time
Like one of those lonely nights
In the diamond spotlight
How crazy years have flied
Oh, how far are we to paradise?
