Song Name: Hotel
When I met you in that hotel room
I could tell that you were so bad news
But I keep messing with ya, messin' with ya
And now you're messing with me, messin' with me
I keep going back to this hotel room
I just don't know what the hell to just tell you
But I like messing with ya, messin' with you
Girl, now you're messing with me, messin' with me
This hotel room
You put me in, my love
Look, girl, I love you
You know me, girl
Better than I know myself, my love
Hotel hell, ooh, hoo
When I met you in that hotel room
I could tell that you were so bad news
But I keep messing with ya, messin' with ya
And now you're messing with me, messin' with me
I keep going back to this hotel room
I just don't know what the hell to just tell you
But I love messing with ya, messin' with you
Girl, now you're messing with me, messin' with me
