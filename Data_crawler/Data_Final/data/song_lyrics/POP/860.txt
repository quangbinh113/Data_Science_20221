Song Name: The Waiter
Let me tell you what to order
I think I know your favorite flavor
Have a seat relax and chill
Here is your drink, your iced tea refill
Everytime when I close my eyes
I can see you in my mind
Just to feel close to you
All I can do is to serve you
When you're near I can feel my heart shake
From inside like a car that goes with no break
Want to be together
Take you to somewhere you never heard
Look into my eyes, you will see how it shine
Time to go, you look at your wrist
No more hello, you take yourself away
It seems so long in my fantasy
And when you're gone I have nothing to say
Everytime when I close my eyes
I can see you in my mind
Just to feel close to you
All I can do is to serve you
When you're near I can feel my heart shake
From inside like a car that goes with no break
Want to be together
Take you to somewhere you never heard
Look into my eyes, you will see how it shine
