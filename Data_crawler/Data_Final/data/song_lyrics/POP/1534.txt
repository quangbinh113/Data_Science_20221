Song Name: Bad Memories (feat. Elley Duh√© & FAST BOY)
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
I think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Losing my head now, my head now
Think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Again and again
One more drink he said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink he said
And baby you got me trippin'
We're face to face
About to do it again, again
Again and again
We 'bout to do it again, again
Again and again
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now (now)
I think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Losing my head now, my head now
Think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Again and again
One more drink she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
One more drink she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories
