Song Name: Solo
Talk to me
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
You see how we living
I'm tryna keep it as simple as possible
You know what I do
Gucci on site, rollies on ice
Get first class flights
Ride it like a bike
Get a brand new wave
Be quiet, don't brag
Never pump gas
Nigga keep it on task
Peelin off flex
Keep it on track
Fuzzin' and fighting, fucking all night
Got it make it count
Love it when it bounce
Girl that's tight
Yeah you do whatever you like
Gucci on sight, rollie on ice
Take my advice, live a better life
You amazed right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
We gotta fuck right now, lets fuck right now
We gotta fuck right now, like it's 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas going to know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoy it outside, been in the low for a while
I'm a solo now, I've been going solo now
20 oz steaks, can't fit it on the plate
Jumbo shrimp, straight out of the lake
Sleeping on the boat
Wake up, take dope
You don't want no smoke
Nigga don't want no starch
We gon' put it on the hood
Aye, before we put it on God
You amazed right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
We gotta fuck right now, lets fuck right now
We gotta fuck right now, like it's 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas going to know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoy it outside, been in the low for a while
I'm a solo now, I've been going solo now
Solo now, everybody know right now
I've been going solo now
Bands on your tags, ain't got bags
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down
Bands on your tags, ain't got bags
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
Niggas gon know right now
Everybody know right now
We been on the low for a while
I been going solo now
