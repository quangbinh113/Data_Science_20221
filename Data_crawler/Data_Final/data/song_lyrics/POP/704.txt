Song Name: Rainy Days on the Sidewalk
Lookin' for the hours to shine
In the evening rains
Strolling on the sidewalk, "hello"
We gotta make it to the show
Now with you
Life is so real
When it's time
Gotta take you though this rainy afternoon
Sixteen hundred miles down the road
Tried to make the things we said (the things we said)
Fancy all the dreams in my head
Love is hard but not unkind
Now with you
Life is so real
Every time I can feel you in the rain
Softly as the morning dew
We slip into and out of the season shower (season shower)
I know I'm gonna make it
Yes, I'm gonna take you for a
Walk in the sun in the rain in December
I'm living this moment with you (this moment with you)
A song in the air when we dance, when we jive
Like young lovers in love songs do
And with you
Life is unsealed
Every time
I hear magic in the sound of raindrops fall
Yes, I know I'm gonna take you for a
Walk in the sun in the rain in December
I'll cherish this moment with you (this moment with you)
A song in the air when we dance, when we jive
Just like lovers in old movies do
And with you
Life is unsealed
Can't you feel
Kind of magic in the sound of rain?
