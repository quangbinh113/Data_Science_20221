Song Name: Yellow Hearts
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts
I said she was a work of art
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes the train I let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
I don't like being all alone
Not good at keeping with the trends
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I heard her
Say that we were more than friends
Oh I, I-I-I know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me and I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts
I said she was a work of art
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean
Have you only been playing games
I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Rossin' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land before it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon
I thought this was good as new
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean
Have you only been playing games
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts
I said she was a work of art
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
Have you only been playing games
