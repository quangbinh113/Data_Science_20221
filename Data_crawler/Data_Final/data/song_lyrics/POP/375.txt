Song Name: My Love (feat. Major Lazer, WizKid, Dua Lipa)
Yeah
Ahh
Yeah
You've been here, but you've been missin' for some time now
Yeah, yeah
Every time I see you, it's a different vibe now
Yeah, oh
I can't help but let you just slip away
Oh, oh
Can we get back what we had yesterday?
Oh, oh
If I ride with you
Better know that I'ma ride for you
Bet I'd use a gun and knife for you
I ain't finna choose the side over you
If I ride with you
Ain't nothin' to provide for you
Ain't nobody in my life like you
Ain't nobody gonna shine like you
Show me my love, oh God
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
My team, team, we on that new ting
My mink draggin' like it's Liu Kang
My show packed, all the dimes there
But I be falling back from all the loose change
I drop the top on that new thing
My chocolate broad, they rock Gucci
Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin
Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah
She gon' show out, show out
Before it's wahala, roll out, roll out
Mhm, yeah, she gon' show out, show out
Before you break it down, girl, roll out, roll out
If I ride with you
Better know that I'ma ride for you
Better know that we can live for each other
That don't mean I gotta die for you
Show me my love, oh god
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ah, yeah, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
Hard to hear, too many girls in the house, ayy
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
I started here, I got the buzz and the clout
I know, I know she got it all, but got nothin' to hold
Every time I saw her, not too many know
She ain't really hard, she act because she hurt, duh
And I can be your last
Leave the past with your first
Show me my love, oh god
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Show me sweet love, yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Show me my love
Show me sweet love, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
