Song Name: never knew a heart could break itself
You're getting used to sleepin' in an empty bed
I'm getting used to the pain
Your blue tiger tattoo, I can't get it out my head
I don't really want it to fade
Something went wrong and we tried so hard to fix it
Couldn't hold on, so we blamed it on the distance
And now I'm in hell
I never knew a heart could break itself
I hope you're happy, but I miss you madly
Don't hold it against me but I'm not even close to
Letting you go yet, reality's frozen
'Cause I can't take the photos of us off the shelve
I never knew a heart could break itself
I still miss your mama, I really hope she's doing well
I feel like I lost a family (yeah-yeah, eh)
So farewell to Oklahoma, thanks for holding onto me
The way I'm holding onto all these memories (eh)
Something went wrong and we tried so hard to fix it
Couldn't hold on, so we blamed it on the distance
And now I'm in hell
I never knew a heart could break itself
I hope you're happy, but I miss you madly
Don't hold it against me but I'm not even close to (not even close)
Letting you go yet, reality's frozen
'Cause I can't take the photos of us off the shelve
I never knew a heart could break itself
No, I never knew a heart could break itself
