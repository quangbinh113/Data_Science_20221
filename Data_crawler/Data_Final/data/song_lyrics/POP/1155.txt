Song Name: Million To One - from the Amazon Original Movie "Cinderella"
Here I go again
I'm imagining a world outside unlike the one I'm in
Daydreamin' again of when I'll get a chance
There's a world that understands
Where you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walkin' in
Daydreamin' again, all I need is a chance
When I feel my fears staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The worlds half asleep
It's gonna wake up and see
If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
Yeah, you're gonna know my name
I can barely sleep
'Cause my heart is always racing, chasing, pacing 'round the room
Livin' carefully is something I don't wanna do
When I feel my fears staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The worlds half asleep
It's gonna wake up and see
If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
Yeah, you're gonna know my name
I can see her now and then
Wanna know what I could be, yeah, eh
I see her laughin', 'cause she knew all along in her head
So when the light is hard to see
She's tellin' me
If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I, I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name, yeah
You're gonna know my name
Yeah, you're gonna know my name
