Song Name: Sweet Lies
Every time you tell me X-Y-Z
I already know you're lying to me
Already know it, by the way, by the way
You ain't gonna play me this time
Not today, not today
I don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (By the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (By the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
Baby, got me actin' all crazy
Lately, things you're sayin' just wanna make me wanna cry
But, tell me why you got ladies all up in my Mercedes?
Ask you where you been, you're so shady
In your eyes, I see your lies
Every time you tell me X-Y-Z
I already know you're lying to me
Already know it, by the way, by the way
You ain't gonna play me this time
Not today, not today
I don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (by the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (by the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
Boy, it's time you learn what I deserve
I don't wanna love like this (Like this)
You can chill with her, feel on her
But I'll be the one you miss (you miss)
Cause you let me down, it's over now
You're beggin' one more kiss, more kiss, more kiss (Oh)
Every time you tell me X-Y-Z
I already know you're lying to me (To me)
Already know it, by the way, by the way
You ain't gonna play me this time
Not today, not today
I don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (By the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
La-la-la, la-la-la (by the way, by the way)
La-la-la, la-la-la
Don't wanna hear your sweet lies
