Song Name: Lovegame
Girl, when you're reaching out
Those hands, just look out (Look out, look out)
Some boys are really conscious but some are not
They'll try to have you in their bed, don't deny (deny)
I know you're weak but don't be a fool like every, every time
Let me guess
You think you can change 'em
So you really care 'bout 'em
But they'll leave at the worst moments
You think you can make it like
Your friend's love stories
But you're not okay like him
Girl, when you're drinking I want you to watch out (Watch out, watch out)
Even if you're missing him, don't call him now
You try to find the reasons and faults in yourself (Yourself)
I know you're sad but don't be a fool like
Every, every damn time
Let me guess
You think you can change 'em
So you really care 'bout 'em
But they'll leave at the worst moments
You think you can make it like
Your friend's love stories
But you're not okay like him
You know that, deep down in your heart
They would've never hurt you
If they really loved you
You deserve something better
You knew it was not right from the start
You deserve something sweeter
Not this fucking stupid love game
(But they'll leave at the worst moments)
(But you're not okay like him)
(But they'll leave at the worst moments)
(But you're not okay like him)
