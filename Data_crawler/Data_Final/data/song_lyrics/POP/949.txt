Song Name: Talk It Up
Smokey walls, dusty halls
No one calls
And all the window plants are dying (la-la, la-la-la)
She talk it up
Half empty cup
Half-hearted love
Half of the time halfway through crying
But she don't live here by herself
Sleeping in the bed she's made
Reading books about self-help
Working late on Saturdays
Unless she's got something at stake
For heaven's sake
Keep him awake
Make no mistake he'll break down daily with no warning
When you're 20 years old, do as you're told
Get bought and sold
It's cold this early in the morning
And he's living on 10th street
Getting home right around dawn
Every night of every week he's proving everybody wrong
Any day now it won't be long, so
Listen when I say
Don't you stop it now come on
Give 'em all what they came here for
Never been there the same before
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
Don't you stop it now come on
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
Captain how can you be so sure?
Talkin' up what I came here for
I've been holding my own
My rag and bone, lock up alone
I don't forget to double-check it, no, no, no
And I learn to rely on me and I
Straighten my tie
Lace my own boots zip my own jacket
Because I did the best I could
I got taken down again
But I got fire in my blood
I got sugar on my skin
And I got nowhere to begin so listen I say
Don't you stop it now come on
Give 'em all what they came here for
Never been down the same before
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
Don't you stop it now come on
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
Captain how can you be so sure?
Talkin' up what I came here for
See ya get what you put in
So you cannot get upset
If you're just dipping your foot in
Because ya don't wanna get wet
And ya ain't made it big yet
Don't you stop it
Give 'em all what they came here for
Gotta talk it up 'til your face gets sore
Don't you stop it now come on
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
Captain how can you be so sure?
Talkin' up what I'm doing it all for
Don't you stop it now come on
Give 'em all what they came here for
Never been done the same before
Talk it up 'til you're face gets sore
Don't you stop it now come on
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
Captain how can you be so sure?
Talkin' up what I came here for
Don't you stop it now
Never been done the same
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
Don't you stop it now come on
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
Captain how can you be so sure?
Talkin' up what I came here for
