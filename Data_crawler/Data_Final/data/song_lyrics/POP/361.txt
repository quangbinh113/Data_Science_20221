Song Name: Sour Candy (with BLACKPINK)
So-sour candy
(So-sour candy)
I'm sour candy, so sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean
뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지
이상적이란 말들로 날 포장한 건
너야 (너야), 너야 (너야)
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까
툭 까보면 어김없이 소릴 질러, wow
Uh-huh (uh-huh), uh-huh (oh, oh, oh-oh)
I'm hard on the outside, but if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside
I might be messed up, but I know what's love
You want a real taste, at least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me, come, come, unwrap me
I'll show you what's me, close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressing, unwrap sour candy
Come, come, unwrap me, come, come, unwrap me
Come on, sour candy (oh, oh, oh-oh)
I'm hard on the outside, but if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside
I'm sour candy, so sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take a bite, take a bite, so-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, so-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, so-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite (uh), sour candy
