Song Name: I Lost Myself In Loving You
They say time is always meant to heal the fall
Tell me why it doesn't seem to help at all
You're okay, I'm here tryna pick the pieces up
Of the old me, before you say that I'm not enough
I'm tryna find the heart I lost
I'm tryna be who I once was
Missing parts of me
All because, all because
I lost myself in loving you, in loving you
Became someone else I never knew, I never knew
I was there when you needed saving
But you wouldn't do the same thing
I lost myself, I lost myself in loving you
(Loving you)
It's sad, you ruined all my favorite things to do
Looking back, the only thing I'd change is you
I'm tryna find the heart I lost
I'm tryna be who I once was
Missing parts of me
All because, all because
I lost myself in loving you, in loving you
Became someone else I never knew, I never knew
I was there when you needed saving
But you wouldn't do the same thing
I lost myself, I lost myself in loving you
In loving you
I lost myself in loving you
Became someone else I never knew
I lost myself in loving you, in loving you
Became someone else I never knew, I never knew
I was there when you needed saving
But you wouldn't do the same thing
I lost myself, I lost myself in loving you, oh
In loving you, oh
I lost myself, I lost myself in loving you
