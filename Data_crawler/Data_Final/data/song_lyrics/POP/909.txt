Song Name: Who's Got You Singing Again
It happened so easy at the start
Got too used to bein' understood
Then one day I caught you looking down
Couldn't reach you like I thought I could
I never knew why you gave it all up
Is that it, was there something I missed in the silences
That we couldn't seem to break through?
Should've known I needed more than this
To hold on to you
Just tell me the truth
Who's got you singing again?
Who put that light back in your eyes?
Who's got you singing again?
That thing you had
I wish you'd come back with the right line
That you threw down the blind
It was just a matter of time
I know, that you've been a little restless
And you're not the type to let it lie
While I'm here counting what I still got left
Was in a daze when you gave it all up
Is that it, was there something I missed in the silences
That we never seemed to break through?
Should've known I needed more than this
To hold on to you
Just tell me the truth
Who's got you singing again?
Who put that light back in your eyes?
Who's got you singing again?
That thing you had
I wish you'd come back with the right line
That you threw down the blind
It was just a matter of time
Who's got you singing again?
Who put that light back in your eyes?
Who's got you singing again?
That thing you had
I wish you'd come back with the right line
That you threw down the blind
It was just a matter of time
Who's got you singing again?
Who put that light back in your eyes?
Who's got you singing again?
That thing you had
You got it back
Never seen you move so easy
Never seen you laugh like that
Never knew how much I was missing
