Song Name: If I Died Last Night
Some things, they're solid, they're built to last
Some things, they fall apart, they break like glass
Sometimes it's scary what they call "Love"
And how fast "what is" can turn to "what was"
Waking up this morning and I'm drunk again
Without you here
Went outside and I lit up a cigarette
And it made me think
If I died last night in an aeroplane
In a pile up on the interstate
If I closed my eyes and went up in flames
If I took too much and I suffocate, it would tear me apart
It would haunt me forever so much you'd never get to know
If I died last night
If I died last night
Can't stand the thought of you getting that call
Dropping your phone, running down the hall
Blaming yourself for when shit hit the wall
And drowning my memory in alcohol
If I went to Heaven it would still be Hell
Without you there
If I died last night in an aeroplane
In a pile up on the interstate
If I closed my eyes and went up in flames
If I took too much and I suffocate, it would tear me apart
It would haunt me forever so much you'd never get to know
If I died last night
If I died last night
I'm sorry, I hate this
I've never felt so alone
I need you now, so come over
I just want you to know
If I died last night in an aeroplane
In a pile up on the interstate
If I closed my eyes and went up in flames
If I took too much and I suffocate, it would tear me apart
It would haunt me forever so much you'd never get to know
If I died last night (if I died last night)
If I died last night
