Song Name: trust issues
Did you notice you were driving past me
Riding in the back seat
When I saw you with her
83 days since you ended things
But it feels like last week
I was wearing your shirt
'Cause I'm
Staying in while you go out tonight
To everywhere we went when you were mine
Runnin' out of ways to make me cry
And I'm tired
You don't pay no rent
To live in my head
I think it's 'bout time that you up and left
I'm over wasting tissues
'Cause I don't wanna miss you
You don't pay no rent
To live in my head
I guess you never meant a single word you said
Thought that I could trust you
But now I've got trust issues
Is it crazy that I still have your things
They sleep next to me
The way that you used to
Just the thought of you it honestly stings
All the memories
You're the only reason I don't feel like me
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried to reach ya
You don't know what you want
Now I don't either
Mhh-mh
You don't pay no rent
To live in my head
I think it's 'bout time that you up and left
I'm over wasting tissues
'Cause I don't wanna miss you
You don't pay no rent
To live in my head
I guess you never meant a single word you said
Thought that I could trust you
But now I've got trust issues
(Angry voice screaming)
