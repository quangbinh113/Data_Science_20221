Song Name: Cold Fire
I don't remember which train I caught
But someone woke me up two stops short
With no bag
No clue
Walking home in a pouring rain
Trying to tell myself nothing's changed
'Cause I'm alright
These streets don't lie
Can't let the memory fade
Every day think I've seen your face
You still give me that cold fire
Burning all those years away
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away
Till the last glass breaks
I couldn't handle those trophy wives
Making money, not making time
No love
No life
No regrets when I walked away
But they've been creeping back every day
I'm running blind
Those dreams don't lie
Can't let ambition fade
Every day think I've seen your face
You still give me that cold fire
Burning all those years away
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away
Till the last glass breaks
Every day think I seen you
Like a knife really cut through
Cracking ice in the soju
Till the last glass breaks
Every day think I seen you
Like a knife really cut through
Cracking ice in the soju
You still give me that cold fire
Burning all those years away
When you give me that true fire
Gotta chase those thoughts away
Till the last glass breaks
Every day think I seen you
Like a knife really cut through
Cracking ice in the soju
Till the last glass breaks
Every day think I seen you
(Like a knife really cut through)
Till the last glass breaks
