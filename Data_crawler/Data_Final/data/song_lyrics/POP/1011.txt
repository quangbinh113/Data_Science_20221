Song Name: I Drink Wine
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something, you just want me
Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval from people I don't even know?

In these crazy times I hope to find something I can cling onto
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true
You better believe, for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire
Oh-oh
So I hope I learn to get over myself
And stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants something from me, you just want me
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (we'll both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled is the road best left behind
Well, so I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants something from me, you just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in the big storm
