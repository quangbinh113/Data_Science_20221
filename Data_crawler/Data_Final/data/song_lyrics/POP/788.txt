Song Name: 有暖氣(You Nuan Chi)
Wake up in the mornin'
Stuck in a traffic beside the sea
Maybe it will be late but you don't mind
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Now 21
You need to shake your body
We both understand
People's gettin' groovy
Now 21
You like to shake your body
We both satisfy
Come on come on stay in light
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Now 21
You need to shake your body
We both understand
People's gettin' groovy
Now 21
You like to shake your body
We both satisfy
Come on come on stay in light
You chosen one
Like to shake off gravity
We both understand
Shape is getting wavy
You chosen one
Deserve a better story
We both stellify
Baby, baby, save my life
Now, 21
You need to shake your body
We both understand
People's gettin' groovy
Now 21
You like to shake your body
We both satisfy
Come on come on stay in light
You chosen one
Like to shake off gravity
We both understand
Shape is getting wavy
You chosen one
Deserve a better story
We both stellify
Baby, baby, save my life
