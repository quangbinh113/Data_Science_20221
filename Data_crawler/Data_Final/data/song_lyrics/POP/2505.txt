Song Name: Crazy What Love Can Do
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do
Da da da do, do
Dun dun dun da do
Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold
But nothing they could buy me made my heart whole
I'd given up on romance, then I found you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Can someone tell me what is happening to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold (gold)
But nothing they could buy me made my heart whole
I was lonely, lonely, then I found you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Can someone tell me what is happening to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
I didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (can do, do)
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (can do, do)
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (can do)
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
I don't ever wanna close my eyes
'Cause this feeling's like paradise
Never felt like this in my whole life
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Can someone tell me what is happening to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (ah-ah-ah)
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (oh-whoa)
Da da da do do
Dun dun dun da do (oh)
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
Can someone tell me what is happening to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
I didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
