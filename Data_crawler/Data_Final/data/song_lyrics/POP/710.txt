Song Name: Aeroplane
Take me out of life
I've been struggling to get by
Saving up my time
Just to waste another dime
I've been struggling to get by
Brighter day and summer ray aren't coming to this town
Like a thousand aeroplane you block away my shine
Mystery is in your mind
Misery's all I can find
Take me out of life
I've been struggling to get by
Saving up my time
Just to waste another dime
On the run like there's no time
Brighter day and summer ray aren't coming to this town
Like a thousand aeroplane you block away my shine
Mystery is in your mind
Misery's all I can find
Under the sun
Won't see no shine
Brighter day and summer ray aren't coming to this town
Like a thousand aeroplane you block away my shine
Brighter day and summer ray aren't coming to this town
Like a thousand aeroplane you block away my shine
Mystery is in your mind
Misery's all I can find
