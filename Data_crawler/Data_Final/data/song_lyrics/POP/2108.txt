(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I bet she could never make you cry
'Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this deep
She can almost be the worst of me (yeah, yeah)
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed
Baby, you just need to send for me
Send for me
Send for me
Send for me (woo)
Send for me
Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo (woo, woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been thinking 'bout you late at night
I've been thinking only of you
Ain't nothing else to really talk about
Boy, show me what you wan' do
These days you've been feeling lonely
Yeah, I've been feeling lonely too
I'ma fuck it up, won't you show me some?
Run it back like you owe me some
Woo, woo, yeah (yeah, send for me, send for me, yeah)
Woo, woo, yeah (send for me, yeah, send for me, yeah)
Woo, woo (send for me, send for me, send for me, yeah)
Tell me 'bout your picture-perfect love
Tell me how you think without the drugs
Maybe you just need to send for me
I don't mean to really love you
I don't even really care about you
I don't mean to really love you
I don't even really care about you, no more (no more)
I don't even really care about you, no more (no more)
I don't even really care about you, no more
Send for me

I don't even really care about you (woo, woo)
I don't mean to really love you
I don't even really care about you, no more (woo, woo)
No more, I don't even really care about you, no more
I don't even really care about you, no more
