Song Name: Feels Like
So complicated
This should be plain and simple, yeah
Don't have to say shit, hush
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
At my tempo
We're not supposed to be here
But I give you more than just somethin'
You better focus more clear
'Cause we can't afford to break nothin'
It should feel like love whenever we touch
But we can't get stuck in the color of lust
Don't it feel like love, love?
Feels like love, love
Stimulated
Can't fight it 'cause we're gonna lose
Manipulate me, baby
Make me do what you want me to, to
We're not supposed to be here
But I give you more than just somethin'
You better focus more clear
'Cause we can't afford to break nothin'
It should feel like love whenever we touch
But we can't get stuck in the color of lust
Don't it feel like love, love?
Feels like love, love
It should feel like love whenever we touch
But we can't get stuck in the color of lust
Don't it feel like love, love?
Feels like love, love
(One, two, three)
Dearly departed
Last love died from broken, heartless
Everybody out here love to start shit
I could see me, you, new apartment
I could see three two kid departments
Must be hell how we keep it sparkin'
See you doin' well and you still ain't lost it
Every single line, say you wanna cross it
You can cross that out with these SI diamonds
Red bottoms, cross that out
Uh, puppy
Best guy in the world ever
Cross that out
Uh, faithful, loyal
You can cross all of these out
Uh, Barbados
London, Paris
I think we done it all now
Or at least in my mind
Do what you wanna do, baby
Don't stay gone too long
Oh, I need you now
Stick around, I'll take you to meet my uncle, Uncle Pernel
We call him "PP Party," he the handicap rapper
He the coolest motherfucker
