Song Name: This One's On Me
Maybe it was for the best
The dog, the house, was just a dream
Maybe I'm being upset
'Cause you're not really here with me
And you got your reasons
And I got my reasons too
You go to Paris
And I paint the living room
I guess I got used to
The things that we used to do
And you made other plans when mine was you
So raise your glass if you've been hurt or broken
Thinking love is hopeless, this one's on me
Yeah, raise your glass to the ones you can't get over
Never got the closure that you need
Then, this one's on me
Maybe I want to forget
The state of mind you put me in
'Cause then it's easier to let
Myself go out and feel again
'Cause I got my feelings
And you got your feelings too
You took forever, while I spend my time on you
I drank to remember the things that we used to do
And you made other plans when mine was you
So raise your glass if you've been hurt or broken
Thinking love is hopeless, this one's on me
Yeah, raise your glass to the ones you can't get over
Never got the closure that you need
Then, this one's on me (this one's on me, this one's on me, this one's on me)
(This one's on me, this one's on me)
This one's on me (this one's on me, this one's on me, this one's on me)
(This one's on me, this one's on me)
So raise your glass if you've been hurt or broken
Thinking love is hopeless, then this one's on me
Yeah, raise your glass to the ones you can't get over
Never got the closure that you need
Then, this one's on me (this one's on me, this one's on me, this one's on me)
(This one's on me, this one's on me)
This one's on me (this one's on me, this one's on me, this one's on me)
(This one's on me, this one's on me)
This one's on me
