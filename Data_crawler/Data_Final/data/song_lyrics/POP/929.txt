Song Name: Juke on Jelly
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
Every morning, something keeps you caught in your dreams
LA is coming, but you always hang out that leaf
You've got every thing that they want, in your own two feet
Right here in this beat
You've got every thing that they need
You're a magic jellybean
Ah
Oh, jelly
Shake 'em up and show it off and move
You know what to do
Ah
Oh, jelly
Trust that in your toes you've got that groove
That nobody can take a break
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
Stop your stalling, wondering "what if it was me?"
Bright lights are shining, but you always turn to leave
You've got every thing that they want, in your own two feet
Right here in this beat
You've got every thing that they need
You're a magic jellybean
Ah
Oh, jelly
Shake 'em up and show it off and move
You know what to do
Ah
Oh, jelly
Trust that in your toes you've got that groove
That nobody can take a break
Hey, come in, come in!
What's your name?
Ich bin Marti Fischer.
Ok, and what are you gonna perform for us today?
Ich spiel nur ein bisschen Klavinet.
Oh, yeah, no, don't, be nervous.
Ich bin noch nicht nervous!
Ah
Oh, jelly
Shake 'em up and show it off, that move
You know what to do
Ah
Oh, jelly
Trust that in your toes you've got that groove
That nobody can take a break
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
Hum a little jelly, get em on the telly
