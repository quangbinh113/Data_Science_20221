Song Name: Hold My Love, Pt. 2
If I were to tell you baby
That the only one that ever makes me feel this way is you
And if I could be your lover,
How I would make you feel your body shake it's all I want to do
If I could find a place to hold my love, uuu uuuh
I need to find a place to hold my love
If I could whisper to you baby
I would tell you all the things I'm feelin' I've been wanting to,
So come on closer to me baby,
Just tell me what you're gonna do
If I could find a place to hold my love, uuu uuh
I need to find a place to hold my love, uuuuh oh oh
If I could find a place to hold my love, uuuh
I need to find a place to hold my love, uuuh
If I could find a place to hold my love
You're not the one for me baby
But even in my dreams I'd find that place where everyone was you
So come on closer to me baby
Just tell me what you're gonna do
If I could find a place to hold my love
I need to find a place to hold my love
If I could find a place to hold my love
I need to find a place to hold my love
