Song Name: girlfriend
You say I want to be your girlfriend
It wasn't really in my plans
When you're around, I got arrhythmia
So in the end, I play pretend
You got the (uh!) of a cool dude
But you should know I like it hot
But if there's really no denying what it says
Then come on, let's give it a shot (you hear me?)
Well, uh, now
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
You say I want to be your, your girl
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
Well, it all depends
You say I want to be your girlfriend
But do you want to be my man?
I'll treat you like you are a carry-on
Like you're my one and only fan (oh my God, I love you)
My kindness is of a false pretense
I've got the ego of a god
But if you take me in your arms, be confident
I commit a character fraud (stop, stop, stop)
Well, oh, oh
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
You say I want to be your, your girl
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
It wasn't really in my plans
Ay, ay
Oh, whoa, oh (ah, ah, ah)
Whoa-oh (ah, ah, ah)
(2, 3, 4)
Secretly, I'm aiming for a rhythm that exceeds my expectations
Am I ever gonna get it?
Your girl is in the business, so there's little room for idle contemplation
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) well, you, oh-whoa
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
You say I want to be your, your girl
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
You say I want to be your, your girl
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
You say I want to be your, your girl
You say I want to be your, your girlfriend
It wasn't really in my plans
