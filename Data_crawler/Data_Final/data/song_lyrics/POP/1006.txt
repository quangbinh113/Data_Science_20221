Song Name: Glad U Came (feat. ZieZie)
(The sun goes down, stars come out)
(And all that counts is here and now)
(Universe will never be the same)
(I'm glad you came) yo
(I'm glad you-) it's Liilz
The sun goes down, my zoot comes up
Smoke a three-five, but it still ain't enough
My mind is fucked, it will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came
Life's like a book and I'm on the next chapter
Hips like Shakira, but she an actor
It's just a factor, she's full of beautiful lies
Man she's just a capper (life)
She played with my heart thеn guess what she said
"Beyond mе, you got a great future ahead"
They left me on read, fuck these hoes
Save the love for the family instead (fuck 'em)
Stick to my family, stick to my team
Seen the bad shit you'll see in your dreams
I'ma be on top with a high esteem
Gotta stay humble when I fuck up the scene
Supreme, McQueens (what's up?)
Materialistic, things I don't need
Not the kinda guy to change for the P's
H said, "It's in the trackies, not in the genes"
The sun goes down, my zoot comes up
Smoke a three-five, but it still ain't enough
My mind is fucked, it will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came shawty
'Bout time you stay for me
Outside with Liilz, we give them chills
We ain't the same buddy
'Cah when the sun goes down
I hit my blunt, I'm glad you came
Bet you glad I'm paid, or is it fame
Why you roll with us?
Is she really down for us?
Tell me, would you stay?
Can't make her stay
And she can't keep it real
For the real, and for real
The sun goes down, my zoot comes up
Smoke a three-five, but it still ain't enough
My mind is fucked, it will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came
(The sun goes down, stars come out)
(And all that counts is here and now)
(Universe will never be the same)
(I'm glad you came)
(I'm glad you-)
