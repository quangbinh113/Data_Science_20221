Song Name: Want to Want Me
It's too hot to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more
It's 100 degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab
I tip the driver 'head of time
Get me there fast (uh)
I got your body on my mind
I want it bad
Ooh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you (oh, yeah)
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile
Down to the floor (uh)
And you whisper in my ear
"Baby, I'm yours"
Ooh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high (so high)
So high
Girl, you're the one I want to want me

And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)

Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me (uh)
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)

Just to get up next to you (yeah)
Just to get up next to you (oh)
Just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high
Ooh, just the thought of you, woah
Gets me so high
So high
Girl, you're the one I want to want me (girl, I want you)
And if you want me, girl, you got me (you got me)
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you (oh-oh)
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you (oh-oh)
I would do anything
Just to get up next to you
Anything and everything
Just to get up next to you (baby)
Just to get up next to you (oh)
Get up, get up
