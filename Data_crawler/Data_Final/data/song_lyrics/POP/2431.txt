Song Name: Miss Me Too
This is "Miss Me Too"
I just woke up, so
It might be a little rough
That's all you ever wanted, right?
Gotta put some space between us, right?
Well, I hope that makes you happy
Doing everything without me
Never really wanted us to end
Only agreed to not seem selfish, and
Now all I do is run in circles
Say, "I'm over you" in rehearsal
And I know it's unhealthy, but
Hope I still run in your mind
No question, you're still on mine
Everywhere I go, I hope I see you
Put on this dress in hopes that
You'd see and then want me back
There's no moment whеn I don't think of you
And I hope that you still miss me too
Not sure if you'rе pretending now
It isn't weird in front of crowds
But I still look towards you
Don't wanna, but it's the truth
Swore I won't fall and it makes me mad
And it's my fault that I still want you bad
Shouldn't take you back, but I still can
Don't tell me that it's wrong or sad, I
Hope I still run in your mind
No question, you're still on mine
Everywhere I go, I hope I see you
Put on this dress in hopes that
You'd see and then want me back
There's no moment when I don't think of you
And I hope that you still miss me too
Miss me too, yeah, I've got room
Never too soon, so here's the truth
I still want you, you want me too?
'Cause I can't ever love somebody else
That's all that I've been saying
You're all of me, you're in my space
And that's okay, call me insane
But I could never love somebody else
Hope I still run in your mind
No question, you're still on mine
Everywhere I go, I hope I see you
Put on this dress in hopes that
You'd see and then want me back
There's no moment when I don't think of you
