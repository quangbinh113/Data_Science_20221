Song Name: Pray
I thought I wanted love
'Til you showed me what it was
I've never been golden
But I swear that I showed it
It's a blessing and a curse
For the better, it's only worse
Wouldn't wish it on no one
It's one hell of a low one
We're going up, we going down
We can run it back, we could work it out
But, no
Late at night, going out my mind
Praying that the sun don't rise, like
No, mmm
Waking up, but wishing that you don't
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is something that I pray you'll never know
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Up at night, drinking liquor like it's water
Waking up, knowing I'm somebody's daughter, but
I don't know a lot about my father
Maybe that's the reason I don't do shit like I oughta, no
I need some medicine, this shit that my head is in
Got me thinking questioning, lying in this bed I'm in
Up at night, drinking liquor like it's water
Maybe that's the reason I don't do shit like I oughta, no
Waking up, but wishing that you don't
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is something that I pray you'll never know
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

You might love the highs, but you ain't seen the lows
You don't know the half of it and I pray you'll never know

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Waking up but wishing that you don't
(Wishing that you don't)
Is something that I pray you'll never know
You'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know
