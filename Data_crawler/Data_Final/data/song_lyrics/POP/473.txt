Song Name: Stay Together
I drank straight to my head
I went outside to smoke a cigarette
And I shattered my phone on the cement
But I don't give a fuck
Now I'm not making sense
I'm laughing at a joke that I don't get
I'm acting like these strangers are my friends
But I don't give a fuck
Yelling at the DJ, "Bro, your shit is boring"
Doing things that I will not regret until the morning
I'ma make it rain down, another round is on me
I'm just here for fun and I don't care about the money
Hey, hey
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Woah-oh-oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singing
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Alright, alright, finish your G&T
The Uber's here, so now it's time to leave
Hey driver, could you pass the AUX to me?
Go ahead and turn it up
Head out of the window
You could call me shameless
Waving to my people now I'm acting like I'm famous
Tell him take the long way, we could see the sunrise
Damn, you look so pretty when the sunlight hits your blue eyes
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Whoa-oh-oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singing
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
For the night
For the night, oh, yeah
I drank straight to my head
I went outside to smoke a cigarette
And I shattered my phone on the cement
But I don't give a fuck, hey
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Whoa-oh-oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait (just wait)
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singing
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
