Song Name: Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down
Ooh-ooh-ooh, New York
Ooh-ooh-ooh, New York
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down on Broadway
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York
On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot
On the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York
One hand in the air for the big city
Streetlights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, "Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah"
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York
