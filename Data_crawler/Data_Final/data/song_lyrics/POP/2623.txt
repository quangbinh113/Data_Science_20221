Song Name: you were there for me
In all of my lonely nights
When I was a ghost inside
You were there for me
You were there for me
Legend never lies, we were meant to be
I'm blessed to be alive when I'm in your company
The battles I would fight, thought that I would bleed
If you found danger
Memories we made could fill a whole book
If we were a movie, we'd be in Hollywood
On my lowest days, you were all it took
My biggest savior
You make my demons go away
Bleach the sky on rainy days
Clear the path when I'm afraid
I've lost my way
In all of my lonely nights
When I was a ghost inside
You were there for me
You were there for me
Whenever I drank too much
Whenever my eyes cried floods
You were there for me
You were there for me
Remember when we'd say, we're at each other's house
When we were far away drinking in another town
The glorious days, I wish they were around
With us forever (forever)
Nothing gets close to London at night
Miss the last train, then I'm 'bout to restart
Started to rain, but it was all fine
'Cause we had each other
You make my demons go away
Bleach the sky on rainy days
Clear the path when I'm afraid
I've lost my way
In all of my lonely nights
When I was a ghost inside
You were there for me
You were there for me
Whenever I drank too much
Whenever my eyes cried floods
You were there for me
You were there for me
You were there, you were there through the heartbreaks
You were there, you were there when I lost faith
Be aware, be aware I would do the same
In all your bad days
You were there, you were there through the heartbreaks
You were there, you were there when I lost faith
Be aware, be aware I would do the same
In all your bad days
In all of my lonely nights
When I was a ghost inside
You were there for me
You were there for me
Whenever I drank too much
Whenever my eyes cried floods
You were there for me
You were there for me
You were there, you were there through the heartbreaks
You were there, you were there when I lost faith
You were there for me
