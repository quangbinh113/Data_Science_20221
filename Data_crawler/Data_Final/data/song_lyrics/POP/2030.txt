Song Name: Chill Like That
Like that
Like that
Like that
Like that
(Let's dance)
Didn't know you could move like that
Two step real smooth like that
All night get down like that
Turn around make it bounce like that
Didn't know you could hang like that
Sippin' on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
Like that
Like that
Didn't know you could hang like that
Sippin' on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
Like that
Like that
Didn't realize you were chill like that
Didn't know you could hang like that
Sippin' on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
Like that
Like that
Like that
Like that
Didn't know you could move like that
Two step real smooth like that
All night get down like that
Turn around make it bounce like that
Didn't know you could hang like that
Sippin' on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
Like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
Like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sippin' on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you were chill like that
