Song Name: Take A Bow
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, standing ovation? Ooh, oh yeah
Yeah y-yeah yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
And baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
But now it's time to go, curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on
Talking' 'bout,? Girl, I love you," "You're the one"
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on?
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
And baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
But now it's time to go, curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out
How about a round of applause?

A standing ovation?
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
Now it's time to go, curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now
