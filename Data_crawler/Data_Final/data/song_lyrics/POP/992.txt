Song Name: Boyfriends
Boyfriends
They think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know they're just misunderstanding
You
You, you're back at it again
Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only calling you when
He don't wanna be alone
Oh, and you go
Why? You don't know
Boyfriends
Are they just pretending?
They don't tell you where it's heading
And you know the game's never ending
You
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You
Feel a fool, you're back at it again
Ooh
