Song Name: Eyes for U (feat. Conor Maynard & Gia Koka)
(Yeah)
I know you been let down again
Post the love and time that you spent
On someone who didn't understand
Who you are
But you know that's all gone in the past
I'm here building us up to last
No one's ever been there like that
For ya, mm-mm
Oh, I need you
And I want you
Ain't gotta wonder
So let the whole world know
It's all looking hella good
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou
Now that all the clouds are gone
I will never make you blue
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
You-ou-ou-ou
(Oh, I need you)
You-ou-ou-ou
(And I want you)
You-ou-ou-ou
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
Now that all thе clouds are gone
I will nevеr make you blue
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
You been getting used to the sound
Slammin' doors, crying on the ground
Tell me who's been making the time
For ya
Oh, is there even someone
Giving love from the heart
Let me show you what it's about
About
Oh, I need you
And I want you
Ain't gotta wonder, no
So let the whole world know
It's all looking hella good
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, oh
Now that all the clouds are gone
I will never make you blue
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
(You-ou-ou-ou)
Oh, I need you
(You-ou-ou-ou)
And I want you
(You-ou-ou-ou)
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
So let the whole world know
It's all looking hella good
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou, yeah
Now that all the clouds are gone
I will never make you blue
'Cause I only got eyes for you-ou-ou-ou
