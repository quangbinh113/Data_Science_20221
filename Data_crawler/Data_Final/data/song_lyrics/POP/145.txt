Song Name: Sweet Melody
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman
We were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band
Wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Every time we'd go dancing, I'd see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times
Anyway he'd start acting up, and I'd be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
I was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet
Yes, when he came along, that's when I lost the groove
There was no song in the world
To sing along or make me move
Sounded something like
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (it was)
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (oh)
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
He used to sing me sweet melodies (oh-oh)
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong (ah, yeah)
The song couldn't go on and on and on (couldn't go on and on)
He used to sing me sweet melodies (sweet, sweet melodies)
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong (me wrong)
The song couldn't go on and on and on
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (oh)
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (oh, whoa)
On and on
On and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong (me wrong)
The song couldn't go on and on and on
(On and on, and on, yeah)
He used to sing me sweet melodies (melodies, yeah)
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies (nah, ah)
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
Sing me sweet melodies (sing me sweet melodies, yeah)
He played me, made me believe it was real love (ooh)
Sang me sweet melodies (oh)
But the day he did me wrong (eh)
The song couldn't go on and on and on, no
