Song Name: If Jesus Was A Rockstar
If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party every day
And diving off the stage
If he'd give it to a popstar
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him
Maybe all I really need
Is something to believe (hell yeah, hell yeah)
I need someone who can teach me
To get on my knees (hell yeah, yeah)
But if he looked like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really, really want you to know that
If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party every day
And diving off the stage
If he'd give it to a popstar
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar (rockstar)
Throwing daddy's money all around (ah)
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar (popstar)
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him (yeah)
I might meet him
In the bathroom (hell yeah, hell yeah, uh)
We might pop one
A red or blue (hell yeah)
But if he looked like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really, really want you to know that
If Jesus was a rockstar (rockstar)
Living like a party every day (ah)
And diving off the stage
If he'd it to a popstar (popstar)
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him (woo)
If Jesus was a rockstar (rockstar)
Throwing daddy's money all around (ah)
While he was getting down (down, down, down)
So they kicked him out of the bar (popstar)
Then I'd, I'd want to be just like him (yeah)
(A rockstar)
(Ah) Just like him
(A popstar)
