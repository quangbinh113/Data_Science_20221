Song Name: Lost in the Fire (feat. The Weeknd)
I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on
(Lights on, lights on, lights on)
You're the only one I got my sights on
(Sights on, sights on, sights on)
Type of sex you could never put a price on
(Price on, price on, price on)
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on
(Dice on, dice on, dice on)
And I just want a baby with the right one
(I just want a baby with the right)
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
(I could never be the one to hide)
And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out
(Find out, find out)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe
Oh-oh (yeah)
I'm tired of being home alone (home alone)
Used to have a girl a day (girl a day)
But I want you to stay (I want you to stay, hey)
You said you might be into girls (into girls)
You said you're going through a phase (through a phase)
Keeping your heart safe (keeping your heart safe, oh)
Well, baby, you can bring a friend (bring a friend)
She can ride on top your face (top your face)
While I fuck you straight (while I fuck you straight, yeah)
And we lost a lot of things in the fire (fire)
So it took a year for me to find out
(Find out, find out)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (whoa-ooh)
I'm tired of being home alone
Used to have a girl a day (girl a day)
But I want you to stay (I want you to stay, hey)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
