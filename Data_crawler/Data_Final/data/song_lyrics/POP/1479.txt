Song Name: Ghost of You
Seven days
Since you went and found some space
I told myself I'm doing great
And I'm not holding on
So don't worry about me
I can keep myself busy
At least it's how I make it seem
Until the day is done
Morning turns to evening
Haven't even thought about you leaving
Swear to God, I almost got this feeling
Off my mind
But every time the lights go out
I see you there when you're not around
Stuck in my head, and I
Know you're gone but I still hold on to the ghost of you
Oh-oh
Every time I'm in the dark
I feel you there like a shock to my heart
Back from the dead, oh I
Know you're gone but I still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you
I can't face
Somebody taking you for drinks and dates
'Cause you know I wonder
You know I wonder if it feels the same, the same
Morning turns to evening
Haven't even thought about you leaving
Swear to God, I almost got this feeling
Off my mind
But every time the lights go out
I see you there when you're not around
Stuck in my head, and I
Know you're gone but I still hold on to the ghost of you
Oh-oh
Every time I'm in the dark
I feel you there like a shock to my heart
Back from the dead, oh I
Know you're gone but I still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh I
Know you're gone but I still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
