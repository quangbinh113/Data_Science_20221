Song Name: Late Night Talking
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, baby
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you
Yeah
When nothin' really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everythin' I can to help you through
If you're feelin' down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby
We've been doin' all this late night talking
'Bout anything you wanted 'til the mornin'
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too
Uh-uh
If you're feelin' down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby
We've been doin' all this late night talking
'Bout anything you wanted 'til the mornin'
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
We've been doin' all this late night talking
'Bout anything you wanted 'til the mornin'
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind (all this late night talking)
I can't get you off my mind (all this late night talking)
I won't even try (all this late night talking)
Can't get you off my
All this late night talking
