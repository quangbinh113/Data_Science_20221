Song Name: Patience
Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go round and round
All the way to step one?
Hear it ask me all the time
Every time it shows up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up
Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down no more)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still my days are shapeless
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone
And we're floating here
Waiting for our wave to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we have gone
Hear it ask me all the time
Showin' up through ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up
I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down no more)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of pages
Growin' up
I should be flying straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, don't be late
'Cause time takes from everyone
