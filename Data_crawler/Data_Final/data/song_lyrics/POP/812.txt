Song Name: Summum Bonum
Summum bonum
Met you last summer
We were just friends that time
Summum bonum
Maybe it was winter
Feelings just showed that night
Summum bonum
I knew it's future
Good thing had gone so fast
Summum bonum
You said it's nature
Nothing is ever lasts
I know, I know why
Why you leave me, baby
Don't leave me behind again
I can't hear your answer through the air
I won't cry, at least I tried
Feeling alone again
Love is a losing game
The game I should never play
All the good time we had
Nothing would be the same
Now I'm the lonely man
Naturally once again
Summum bonum
I know it's future
Good thing it had gone so fast
Summum bonum
You say it's nature
Nothing has ever last
I know, I know why
Why you leave me, baby
Don't leave me behind again
I can't hear your answer through the air
I won't cry, atleast I tried
Dream all the time
Dream all the time
I hold your hand every day
You tell me not to worry again
Together go home
Summum bonum is good time with you and I
Have no place to go
'Cause I love you so
Don't let me fall
Yeah baby, I pray for the future
May the grace in your nature
Make you come home
Summum bonum is good time with you and I
Have a place to go
If you love me so
You could have it all
But I know it's gonna be the future
All you would say, "It's nature"
You never come home
Summum bonum was good time with you
