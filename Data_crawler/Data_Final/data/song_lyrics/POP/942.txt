Song Name: Disco Yes
I want to stay
But I need to go
I want to be the best for you
But I just don't know what to do
'Cause baby, say I've cried for you
The time we have spent together
Riding through this English whether
And as the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree
Baby I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
And the grass is always greener
On the other side
Maybe you should come and take a trip sometime
Oh you seem keener
When they turn to night
But you're different out your mind
Tell me it's a sign
As the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time hads gone so fast
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree
Baby I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
