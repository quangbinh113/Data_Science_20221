Song Name: Marathon
This burning fire inside my chest
Keeps me alive when they want me dead
Just when I'm hanging by a thread
Look in my eyes and I'm seeing red
I'm taking punches
Sweat dripping down
I'll take a 100
Another round
Mind over matter
Call it Cliche
Oh but you know what they say
It's not a sprint It's a Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Oh No it's not a sprint It's a Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprints it's a
Yeah stick and stones
Might break my bones
But I get back up on my own
Won't sleep till all is said and done
Won't stop until the battles won
I'm taking punches
Sweat dripping down
I'll take a 100
Another round
Mind over matter
Call it cliche
Oh but you know what they say
It's not a sprint It's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Oh No it's not a sprint It's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprints it's a
Ay eh eh aye
Yeah eh eh aye
Yeah eh eh aye
Yeah eh eh aye
It's not a sprint it's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprints it's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprint it's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprint it's a
Marathon
Marathon
Marathon
Ooh it's not a sprint it's a
Ay eh eh ay
Yeah eh eh aye
Yeah eh eh aye
Yeah eh eh aye
