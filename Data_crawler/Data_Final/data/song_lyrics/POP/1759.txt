Song Name: Tek It - Sped Up
Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
And how much can I be expected to tolerate?
So I started to think 'bout the plans I made, the debt unpaid
And you just can't call a spade "a spade"
I watch the Moon, let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (now I let it go, and I watch as things play out like)
So long, nice to know you, I'll be moving on
We started off in such a nice place
We were talking the same language
I o-open, and I'm closing,
You can't stand the thought of a real beating heart
You'd be holding, having trouble,
O-o-owning and admit that I am hoping
I watch the Moon, let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (now I let it go, and I watch as things play out like)
So long, nice to know you, I'll be moving on, moving on
You
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth
I knew
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth
I never thought we'd see it through
I never could rely on you
And the few times your face came into view
Into view
I'm not into you
Into you
