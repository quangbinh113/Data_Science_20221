Song Name: By My Side ft. Tiara Andini
I just can't stop what I'm feeling
If it's you making me feel this way
Your beauty's making me nervous
And I just can't breathe when I hear your name
You know sometimes you're just selfish
And I don't know how you just do it
You make me feel these emotions
And I just fall for you every single day
So, I just wanna wake up next to you in the morning
Dance you through the night, oh my love
Kiss me, hug me tight, and just love me
I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
What's wrong with my chest it's beating
So fast, I can't even hear myself
You look in my eyes with meaning
I drown in it so deep, I can't escape
You know sometimes you're just selfish (selfish)
Uuh, I don't know how you just do it
You make me feel these emotions
And I just fall for you every single day
So, I just wanna wake up next to you in the morning
Dance you through the night, oh my love
Kiss me, hug me tight, and just love me
I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
Come right here and hold me more
Don't leave me now and shut the door
You and I are so meant for more
Hold my hand, we'll stay together
We gave our promises remember
So, baby stay with me forever more
So, I just wanna wake up next to you in the morning
Dance you through the night, oh my love (oh my love)
Kiss me, hug me tight, and just love me
I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
Na-na-na, I want you forever by my side
