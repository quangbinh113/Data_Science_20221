Song Name: Faithful (feat. Marc E. Bassy)
I don't wanna be a part-time lover
I don't wanna make you wonder where I've been
I don't wanna get myself in trouble
Out there fuckin' 'round with these hoes again
I don't wanna make you feel insecure, baby
Wanna be yours, baby
Something 'bout you got me feeling more mature lately
Make you the only girl in the world
I've done broke so many hearts, it's disgraceful
And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel
But if you walked out right now, it would be painful
Girl, you're so bad, you make me faithful
You know, yeah
At the crossroads and now I got the blues
I know Page Six tagged you, but you ain't watched the news (-graceful)
I know I made some mistakes that you can't just excuse
I know I did you no favors far as your trust issues (angel)
Were concerned, the second chances got burned
Each time that I went back on my word, it's time to learn (painful)
As the vinyl turns, Usher Raymond - 6, "Let It Burn"
And I'll just sit here waitin' until this karma returns like, yeah
I've done broke so many hearts (you know), it's disgraceful (it's disgraceful, uh)
And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (no, yeah)
But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (painful, uh)
Girl, you're so bad, you make me faithful (uh)
Faithful to you (you know, hahaha, yeah)
Faithful to you (if anybody can do, that'd be you)
Yeah, you say I lost my way and you hope it gets found
Pick the pieces back up, turn this whole thing around
You told the truth, I understood when you broke it all down
These double standards that you dealt with, I'm noticing now
You get upset when I'm on the road and these hoes are around
But it's a job, I can't stay home and be broke in the town
You know the real me, yeah, the Gerald when no one's around
Only one person I thought of when I wrote this shit down
Reverse roles and we suddenly swapped
I'm out the picture, now it happens, some things that get cropped
And all that's left is pretty faces, they all Photoshopped
But I would trade 'em in a heartbeat, everyone would get dropped for you
I've done broke so many hearts (you know), it's disgraceful (it's disgraceful, uh)
And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (I'm not, yeah)
But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (painful, uh)
Girl, you're so bad (you know), you make me faithful
Faithful to you
Faithful to you
And if I ever doubted you, it's 'cause my vision's clouded
Run away from the truth, I knew (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Now I feel so surrounded ever since the day I found ya
Nothing is so new, we never knew
With you, yeah
Hmm, I'm gonna be faithful now, to you
I've done broke so many hearts, it's disgraceful (oh, yeah)
And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (I'm no angel, yeah)
But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (walked out right now, oh, yeah)
Girl, you're so bad (you're so bad), you make me faithful
Faithful (I'm gonna be) to you (I'm gonna be)
Faithful to you
Faithful (I'm gonna be) to you (I'm gonna be)
Faithful to you
