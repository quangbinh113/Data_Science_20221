Say,
"Please spend a time with me,
Crossing a river under the moonlight,
We'll paddle 'till night", yeah!
The quite waves come
To pick us up,

Do you have a time with me?
Let's dance together on the dance floor,
We'll dance 'till night, yeah!

What are you waiting for?
Hurry up take your step
To see my dreams
Of you tonight
Close your eyes,
Clear your head,
Let it gooo...
