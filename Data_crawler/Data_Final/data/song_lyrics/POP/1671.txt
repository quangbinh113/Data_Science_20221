Song Name: Jenny from the Block (feat. Jadakiss & Styles P.) - Track Masters Remix
Children grow and women produce and
Men go working
Some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
L.O.X, yuh
J.Lo, yeah (yeah yo, yo)
We off the block this year
Went from a low to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear L.O.X in the air
Yeah, we're at the airport out Dblock
From the block where everybody air-forced out
With a new white T.U. fresh
Nothin' phony with us
Make the money
Get the mansion
Bring the homies with us
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J.Lo to this headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
I'm real, even on Oprah
That's just me
Nothin' phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
I'm down to Earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
And can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, they're assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while you don't know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones you came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, L.O.X and J.Lo
Act like they don't but they know
Don't be fooled the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from The Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from The Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from The Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from The Bronx)
