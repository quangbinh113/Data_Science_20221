Song Name: LET THE GRASS GROW
I wait for the morning tide, the oceans to rise
But I lay here broken, too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck
So I tell myself this lie, I'm not scared to die
Make molehills of mountains, there's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet
So I'll leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self-sabotage, all of our other scars don't compare (oh, oh)
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself, so I don't sink
Find my peace there, underneath the hurricane
Break a promise, so I can leave
Burn a forest, so I can sleep
Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me
There's nothing to fill this void
Start turning this sorrows
So I lay here soaking, the sand in my bed
What a day to regret
So I'll leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self-sabotage, all of our other scars don't compare (oh, oh)
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself, so I don't sink
Find my peace there, underneath the hurricane
Break a promise, so I can leave
Burn a forest, so I can sleep
Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me
We didn't make a difference
And we thought we were different
Hey, ayy, oh, woah, woah
