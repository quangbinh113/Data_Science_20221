Song Name: Wide Awake in a Dream
Every little thing she does to me
Is every little thing that I believe
She is my home
And every little time I think of her
Is every little time I'm thinking now
She is my morning
It's gonna get in my head the cut on her head
She is the only one for me
Shown on now
Wide awake in a dream
Every little time I walk this hall
She is a little mixed up but that's all right
She is my baby
Every little thing she says to me
Is every little thing that I believe
She is my morning
It's gonna get in my head the cut on her head
She is the only one for me
Shown on now
Wide awake in a dream
Here we go now
Watch
The morning sun
He comes at home
Set all gone
Let me fall in love with the moon, the conversation
Yeah, let's take a walk down the halls when we first meet
Let's get kissed on the next flight, New York night
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
In a dream
And every little thing she says to me
I believe
And every little time I walk with her
I feel so good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Wide awake in a dream
Wide awake in a dream
