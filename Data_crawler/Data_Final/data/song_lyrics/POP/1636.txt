Song Name: Better
(Nothing feels better)
("I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up")
("I'm not, I'm so sober!")
I love to see you shine in the night
Like the diamond you are
I'm good on the side, it's alright
Just hold me in the dark
No one's gotta know what we do
Hit me up when you're bored
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet
When you need it, it's yours
All I hear is...
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh, nah
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, I admit
Nothing feels better than this
You say we're just friends, but I swear
When nobody's around

You keep my hand around your neck, we connect
Are you feeling it now?
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God
Felt my feet lift the ground
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talkin' about
In my ears
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh, nah
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, I admit
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Likeâ€“
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh, nah
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, I admit
Nothing feels better than this
Better than this
Nothing feels better than this oh yeah
