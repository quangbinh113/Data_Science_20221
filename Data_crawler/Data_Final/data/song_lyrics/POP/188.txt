Song Name: Look What You've Done
Take my photo off the wall
If it just won't sing for you
'Cause all that's left has gone away
And there's nothing there for you to prove
Oooh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Ooooh
Give me back my point of view
'Cause I just can't think for you
I can hardly hear you say
What should I do?
Well, you choose
Oooh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Oooh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
Take my photo off the wall
If it just won't sing for you
'Cause all that's left has gone away
And there's nothing there for you to do
Oooh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Ooh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
