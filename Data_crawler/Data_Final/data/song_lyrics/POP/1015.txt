Song Name: Skyline
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
All lights all on you
City lights fall on you
Such a beautiful world
We're so high, I'm with you
Hypnotized, I'm with you
Such a beautiful world
It's like I'm livin' my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels fair
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels fair
When you take my hand in my passenger side
Leave it all in our rearview as we pass the finish line (It's just us)
Yeah, it's you and I racin' under the green light (Feel the rush)
Intensify, lately I feel so alive, such a beautiful world
It's like I'm living my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels fair
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels fair
When you
Yeah
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
