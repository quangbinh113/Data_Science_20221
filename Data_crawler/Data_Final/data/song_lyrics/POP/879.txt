Song Name: Lover Girl
Never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
Never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
Baby I can look around even if it took forever
But I can tell you I'll never find nothin' better
Never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
What kind of matter did you, did you have there on your finger tip?
What kind of potion did you slip me when you kissed me on my lips?
Darling every time you put me on your spell
It's likе I throw a penny in a wishing well
And I'm nevеr gonna find me another lover, girl like you
What kind of fool would ever, ever do you like I done before?
Who would ever let you, let you go and walk on out that door
Every day I love you close
That's why I wanna let you know
Oh, I'm never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
I'm never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
I could, I could look around, even if I could forever
But I can tell you now, never find nothing better
Never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
Never gonna find me
Oh got to find me
Never gonna find me
Oh got to find me
Never gonna find me another lover, girl like you
Got to find me
Oh got to find me
Never gonna find me
Oh got to find me
