Song Name: We've Gotta Find a Way Back to Love - Bonus Track
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way how to live
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way, find it now
There was a time when love watched over us
We've lost the fate somehow and misused the trust
We're bound to lose more than we've bargained for
We need each other now more than before
You gotta stop right now and think about what we're doin'
You gotta stop right now and think about what you're losin'
Yeah, we've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way how to live
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way, find it now
Why not be honest and face the truth?
We've gotta save what's left of our youth
Each other's feelings, we do misuse
Let's try to understand each other's clues
You gotta stop right now and think about what we're doin'
You gotta stop right now and think about what you're losin'
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've lost the key to our sweet success
We've lost the way to our happiness
We've lost the key to our sweet success
We've lost the way to our happiness
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way how to live
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way how to live
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way how to live
We've gotta find a way back to love
We've gotta find a way, find it now
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
We've gotta find a way
