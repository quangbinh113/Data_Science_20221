Song Name: Lover Man
Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah I gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta here as fast as I can
No hard feelings
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and I got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as I can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo...
