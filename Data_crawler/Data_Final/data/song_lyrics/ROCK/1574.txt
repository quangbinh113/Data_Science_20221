Song Name: Judy Is a Punk - 2016 Remaster
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin
Joined the Ice Capades
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Second verse, same as the first
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin
Joined the Ice Capades
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Third verse, different from the first
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Frisco
Joined the SLA
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
