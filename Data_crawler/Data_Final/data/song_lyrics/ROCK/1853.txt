Song Name: Louis To Frisco
I'm as free as a bird now
As flighty as a bumblebee
I'm here today and gone tomorrow
Foot loose child and fancy free
I'm absolutely independent
Nothin' at all is gonna worry me
I believe I was born to travel
The open road is gonna bring me close
To come to know some way-out people
To say the least, I did the most
Who live and love across both borders
Trip, East and West from coast to coast
I only have one cradle to rock now
I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go
From St. Louis to San Francisco
Ah! From Canada to Mexico
I'm gonna let my cradle rock now
'Til it just won't rock no more
