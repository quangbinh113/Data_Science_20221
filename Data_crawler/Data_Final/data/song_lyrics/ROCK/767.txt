Song Name: Perfect Strangers
Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Ohhh, and cold
Cold spirits of ice
Ah, ah, all my life
I am the echo of your past
I am returning, the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Ohhh, and laughing
As the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day
If you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Oh, is aching with the dead of the night
Ohhh, precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
