Song Name: Sober
I feel a rise in the temperature
I'm abusing all the time that's left
Realizing how I'm so washed up
Can't make this up
Every day is a waste but I make it last
I'd march with the saints but they turned their backs
One thing that I know for sure
I'm a walking heart attack
I wish I was sober to feel the pain
So many dark days I can't explain
And all of your love just falls like rain
I don't have the answers, I wish I was sober
To find my way
You turn your cheek laugh behind my back
All your friends think that I'm insecure
But if they knew the way you've cut me out
They'd tear you down instead of me
Yesterday was a waste, I can't take it back
I'd sin with the saints then they'd turn their backs
Nobody knows for sure
If they're ever coming back
I wish I was sober to feel the pain
So many dark days I can't explain
And all of your love just falls like rain
I don't have the answers, I wish I was sober
To find my way
I can't explain this constant pain
The agony is killing me
I wish I was sober to feel the pain
So many dark days I can't explain
And all of your love just falls like rain
I don't have the answers, I wish I was sober
To find my way
To find my way
To find my way
