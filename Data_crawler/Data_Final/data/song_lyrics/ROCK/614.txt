Song Name: Americano
He's drivin' a jeep
But he ain't in the Army
Gets all his cigarette money
From his mommy
Dressed like a rootin' tootin'
Texas cowboy
But this lone ranger's
Never seen a horse
He wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey and soda
Now he's never goin' back
He's cruisin streets for gold
Dressed in designer clothes
Brother if your too slow
You'd better not blink
Or you'll wind up in the drink
Wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
Gotta buy a diamond ring
'Cause that's his baby's
Favorite thing
Okay, all right, yeah man
Wanna be American
Wanna be American
He's in the land where
Anything can happen
Reach for the stars
Grab that golden ring
Just remember he's Americano
Well watch it pal
'Cause he'll take everything
He wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey & soda
Now he's never goin' back
He likes that rock and roll
He's playing baseball
Loves Marilyn Monroe
A coca cola Joe
And a pizza pie to go
Wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
Gotta buy a diamond ring
'Cause thats his baby's
Favorite thing
Okay, all right, yeah man
Wanna be American
Wanna be American
Wanna be American
