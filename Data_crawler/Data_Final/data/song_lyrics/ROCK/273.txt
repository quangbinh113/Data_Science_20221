Song Name: Miracle
If you could only feel the way that I feel
Ready for the war to come my way
Yeah, I struggled so I know what it takes
The pressure only builds 'til it breaks
If you could only feel the way that I feel
You may think it's something spiritual
But I'm betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle
If you could only see the way that I see
You could find the faith to take the leap
It only took one shot to prove I'm not made of glass
There's no pain you could cause that won't eventually pass
If you could only see the way that I see
You'd be betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My will is stronger
Stronger!
Wait
You may think it's something spiritual
But I'm betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough (don't need a miracle)
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle
Miracle
