Song Name: Daylight
I was diagnosed with a fear of getting too close
Had to tell the ones I love, I was on the ropes
I'm not the only one whose life's been pulled apart
Spending one year and three months in the dark
So, here we are, all dressed to kill, where should we go?
Into the wild again to face the great unknown
And have the midnight conversations you and I postponed
You saved my life
Not once but twice
You keep me free from falling
You saved my life
Make it all alright
When I don't feel like talking
You make sure I always see the daylight
It's amazing what the hard times can reveal
Like who shows up, who walks away, and who's for real
So, take me on, I'll take the wheel, and we can both outrun the past
We will always live forever if we don't look back
You saved my life
Not once but twice
You keep me free from falling
You saved my life
Make it all alright
When I don't feel like talking
You make sure I always see the daylight
(Have faith that you're not alone)
(Have faith that you're not on your own)
(Have faith that you're not alone)
(Have faith that you're not on your own)
It's amazing what the hard times can reveal
Like who shows up, who walks away, and who's for real
It's amazing what the hard times can reveal
Like who shows up, who walks away, and who's for real
Who shows up, who walks away, and who's for real
You saved my life
Not once but twice
You keep me free from falling
You saved my life
Make it all alright
When I don't feel like talking
You make sure I always see the daylight
