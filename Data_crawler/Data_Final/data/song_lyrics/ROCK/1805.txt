Song Name: Get Over It
I turn on the tube what do I see a whole
Lot of people cryin' don't blame me
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves
Victim of this victim of that
Your mama's too thin and your daddy's too fat
Get over it
Get over it
All this whinin' and cryin' and pitchin' a fit
Get over it
Get over it
You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if they gave you some cash
The more I think about it ol' Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers kill 'em tonight
You don't wanna work you wanna live like a
King but the big bad world doesn't owe you a thing
Get over it
Get over it
If you don't want to play then you might as well split
Get over it
Get over it
It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're makin' the most of your losin' streak some call it sick
But I call it weak
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt
You wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter bringin' everybody down
Bitch about the present blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick it's little ass
Get over it
Get over it
All this bitchin' and moanin' and pitchin' a fit
Get over it
Get over it
Get over it
Get over it
It's gotta stop some time so why don't you quit
Get over it
Get over it
Get over it
