Song Name: Mr. Crowley
Mr. Crowley
What went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley
Did you talk to the dead?

Your lifestyle to me seems so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah, you waited on Satan's call
Mr. Charming
Did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming
In nocturnal rapport

Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Oh, conceived in the eye of a secret
Yeah, and they scattered the afterbirth
Mr. Crowley
Won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley
It's symbolic, of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant, yeah!
