Song Name: The Language Of My Heart - France Bonus Track
I walked down to Notre-Dame
To say a prayer for Bataclan
I miss the city on the Seine
As though French blood was in my veins
Went to the Louvre, could spend hours
Went to the top of the Eiffel Tower
Heard the Marseillaise in troubled times
The way you sang for me, blew my mind
Music is the language of my heart
The language of your heart
Together, we are strong
The music is the bridge into your heart
No matter where we go
No matter where we are
Felt Ã‰dith's spirit in the bar
Of the very famous Olympia
Rocked out like Johnny, Johnny Hallyday
They will never ever fade away
Music is the language of my heart
The language of your heart
Together, we are strong
The music is the bridge into your heart
No matter where we go
No matter where we are
Allez-vous bien? Do you speak French?
Oh, well, I don't
Pardon, my friend
But there is one thing that is true
Just let me tell you, mes amis
I'm still loving you
