Song Name: LAUGH. CRY. SMILE. DIE. (feat. Shane Told of Silverstein)
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this idea that I'm selling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) can anybody hear me?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) does anybody care?
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this worry that we're falling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody listening?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody there?
Flashback to 1983, emphasize the uncertainty
The memo says the company, turns truth into a theory
The lies they tell our children shaping everything we know
Turning fact into a fiction streamed on every single show
Packaged and rebranded so that it's consumed by all
Simplify the lyrics so the world can sing along
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this idea that I'm selling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) can anybody hear me?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) does anybody care?
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this worry that we're falling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody listening?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody there?
In the fluorescents of boardrooms, the proof disappears
In the darkness of night, they prey on our fears
Now they're capping all the questions, no accountability
The only answers given are the ones that keep them free
They knew it, they sold it then wrote it into law
To greenwash, to market, the cleanest death of all
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this idea that I'm selling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) can anybody hear me?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) does anybody care?
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this worry that we're falling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody listening?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody there?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody there?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this idea that I'm selling for nothing
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) can anybody hear me?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) does anybody care?
Can you hear me, hear me calling?
I got this worry that we're falling for nothing
(Hey) is anybody listening?
(Hey) is anybody fucking there?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody listening?
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) is anybody there?
