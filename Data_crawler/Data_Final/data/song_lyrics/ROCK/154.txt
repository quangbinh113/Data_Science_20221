Song Name: I Still Burn
Don't tell me I don't need this anymore
Don't tell me I don't feel the same inside
What the hell do I keep fighting for?
'Cause underneath I'm never satisfied
Oh, I still believe in it
I bleed for it
Yeah, I'll take the punishment
I never learn, I never learn
Yeah, I believe in it
I bleed for it
Sacrifice it all for it
My soul still stirs and I still
I still burn
Even when they think I'm at my end
I get up again
I still burn
Every time the fire floods these veins
Oh, it never fades
I still burn
I've put a million miles upon these bones
Living out this villain I portray
There's nothing left of me after the show
The devil made a deal that I can't break
And so I pay the dues, fill the rooms
Watched some good friends gone too soon
There's nothing worse
It always hurts
I still carry them deep within
They're with me like they're guardians
Their souls still stir
And I still
I still burn
Even when they think I'm at my end
I get up again
I still burn
Every time the fire floods these veins
Oh, it never fades
I still burn
Creeping into my brain
This dread never goes away
Anxiety, mortality
They always get the best of me
The fear always feeds the flames
Yeah, I believe in it
Bleed for it
Sacrifice it all for it
My soul still stirs and I still
I still burn
Even when they think I'm at my end
I get up again
I still burn
Every time the fire floods these veins
Oh, it never fades
I still burn
I go on and on
I go on and on
I still burn
I go on and on
I go on and on
I still burn
