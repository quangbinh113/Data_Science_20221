Song Name: Frenzy
Got a dick and 2 balls, that's more than you all
My mind'll be sick if you I suffer the pricks
So shut up and love me 'cause fun is my buddy
All the sharks in the sea are waiting on me
I'm in a frenzy, you fucking prick
I'm in a frenzy, you goddamn dick
I'm in a frenzy, you stone douchebag
And hate that I feel is, oh, so real
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy, woo
I'm sick of the squeeze, I'm sick of the tease
I'm sick of the freeze, I'm sick of disease
So give me a try before I fucking die
My mind is on fire, when I oughta retire?
I'm in a frenzy, fucking prick
I'm in a frenzy, goddamn dick
I'm in a frenzy, you stone douchebag
And this hate that I feel is, oh, so real
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy
Do you get it?
No
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm in a frenzy (frenzy)
I'm having a great time (frenzy)
I'm gonna burn (frenzy)
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy (frenzy)
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, oh (frenzy)
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy
I got addicted to walls
(Be careful)
