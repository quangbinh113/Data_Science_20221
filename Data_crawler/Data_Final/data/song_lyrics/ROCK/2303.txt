Song Name: The Last Day Of Summer
Nothing I am, nothing I dream
Nothing is new
Nothing I think or believe in or say
Nothing is true
It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah, it used to be so easy
But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold (so cold)
The last day of summer
Never felt so old (so old)
All that I have
All that I hold
All that is wrong
All that I feel for or trust in our love
All that is gone
It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah, it used to be so easy
But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold (so cold)
The last day of summer
Never felt so old (so old)
The last day of summer
Never felt so cold (so cold)
Never felt so (so)
