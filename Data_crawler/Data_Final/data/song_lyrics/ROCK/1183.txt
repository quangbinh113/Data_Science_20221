Song Name: Round Are Way - Live at Knebworth, 10 August '96
Round are way!
The paper boy is working before he goes
Lying to the teacher he knows he knows
He didn't and he should'verought his lines in yesterday
Ernie bangs the sound and the day begins
The letterbox is open and your cash falls in
I'll meet you at the office just before the staff clock in
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds sing for you
'Cause they already know yer
They already know yer
Cab it to the front as it's called a draw
Everybody's knockin' at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound and no one's spoken since half past four
Cab it to the front as it's called a draw
Everybody's knockin' at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound and no one's spoken since half past four
La, la-la, la-la, la
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds sing for you
'Cause they already know yer
They already know yer
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds are minging
Round are way it's alright
Round are way the birds sing for you
'Cause they already know yer
They already know yer
It's up to you to sing the next!
Hey you
Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high
Hey you
Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
Hey you
Wearing the crown
Making no sound
I heard you feel down
Hey you
Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's
Gone out of your life
Shit!
This is our call for every motherfucking one of ya!
