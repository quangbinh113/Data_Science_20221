Song Name: Fun, Fun, Fun (Mono)
Well, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blastin'
Goes cruisin' just as fast as she can now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks and drives like an ace now (you walk like an ace now)
(You walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like the Roman chariot race now (you look like an ace now)
(You look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now (you drive like an ace now)
(You drive like an ace)
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now (you shouldn't have lied now)
(You shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinkin' that your fun is all through now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now (you shouldn't have lied now)
(You shouldn't have lied)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy...)
