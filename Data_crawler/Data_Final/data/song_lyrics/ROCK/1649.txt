Song Name: All the Young Punks (New Boots and Contracts) - Remastered
I'm hanging about down the market street
I spent a lot of time on my feet
When I saw some passing yabbos
And we did chance to speak
But I knew how to sing, you know
And they knew how to pose
And one of them had a Les Paul
Heart attack machine
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
Everybody wants to bum a ride on the rock 'n' roller coaster
And we went out and got our name in small print on the poster
Of course we got a manager and though he ain't the mafia
A contract is a contract, when they get 'em out of here
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
All you young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
You gotta drag yourself to work
Drug yourself to sleep
You're dead from the neck up
By the middle of the week
Face front you got the future
Shining like a piece of gold
But I swear as we get closer
It look more like a lump of coal
But it's better than some factory
Now that's no place to waste your youth
I worked there for a week once
And I luckily got the boot
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
All the young punks, laugh your life
'Cos there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts, live it now
'Cos there ain't much to die for
