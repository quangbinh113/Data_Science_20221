Song Name: Bordeaux In My Pirough
So long, Jean, got a little show, thanks for the Bordeaux
I got to go, push my pirough way down the bayou
They got a band up on the stand and a beautiful light show
Au revoir, Jean, dig the show from up on the plateau
In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou
Creeping along, singin' a song, c'est, c'est bon, bon
Playin' the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro
Havin' a duet with my coquette out on the bayou
It's growin' night, we've got no lights out on the bayou
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux
Two more miles goin' wild to play my acoustic
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music
One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux
While we's groovin', a fog was movin' in on the bayou
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux
Ay-ay, Jean, I missed the show up on the plateau
Si vous plait, push my pirough back up the bayou
No see the band, no see the stand, no see the light show
Ah, Jean, we had a show out on the bayou
