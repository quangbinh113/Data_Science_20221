Song Name: I Want To Go To The Beach
I wanna go to the beach
I don't care if it's decadent
I don't know where my spirit went
But that's alright
I wanna go to the deep
'Cause there's nowhere I want to be
And nobody I want to see
But that's alright
Particles of pain in my brain
I guess they're here to stay
They work their way inside
And I can't hide or even walk away
You can convince the world
That you're some kind of superstar
When an asshole is what you are
But that's alright
Waiting, hating the shit life throws my way
Hating, waiting to make my escape
I wanna go to the beach
