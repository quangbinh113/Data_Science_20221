Song Name: The Sails of Charon - 2015 - Remaster
Dark night, there is no light
In the realm of the black magic man
Souls flight into the cold blight
Of the destroyer's magic land
Poor man
Hose spirits are stronger
They're the ones who will reign
You're struggles are in vain
Blind man
You're suckin' your own blood
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying
Blind man
You're suckin' your own blood
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying
Burn out your evil desire
The dark Angel's kingdom
Is made out of mire
Burn out your evil desire
The dark Angel's kingdom
Is made out of mire
Keep on for the kingdom of light
There is no darkness
And there is no night
