Song Name: Livin' On A Prayer
Once upon a time
Not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay for love
Mmm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Whoa, we're half way there
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, ooh, it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby it's okay, someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Oh, we're half way there
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-ah
