Song Name: In the Moment
48
There's something to be said
About the difference between us
You look for photo ops
We make sure days don't stop
We live to feel
And you exist to be seen
You push a narrative
That skews what it all means
When we're in the moment
We touch experience you can't fake
Yeah, yeah
And if I lose this feeling
Heart would stop beating
It can't be beaten
You seek validation
Through the numbers you gain
Reaching for attention
You so desperately crave
Take on whatever meets us
Embracing sporadic changes
Feeling the dirt underneath us
Taste the air we're breathing
When we're in the moment
We touch experience you can't fake
Yeah, yeah
And if I lose this feeling
Heart would stop beating
It can't be beaten
Locked in through sound
Fused through the ground
Basic ingredients for full experience
OIGA MIRE VEA
The perfect moment
We all feel it
The right here and now
You wouldn't believe this
