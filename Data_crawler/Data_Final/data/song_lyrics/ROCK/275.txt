Song Name: Welcome to the Chaos (feat. Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills)
Once upon a time, I was fine
I used to be happy, but there is nothing to me no more
"It'll be alright" is a lie
Everything inside of me is fucked, my insanity is high
But it's all good, I got new friends
All of my crew think I'm lucid
Yeah, let me take roll, now who's in?
Misfits with dreams of delusion
We're running up against the wall
If we keep on pushing, we can make it fall
There's nothing left to lose at all
So give in to all the pain
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out
Nobody's gonna save us
Can't you see that this is our fate now (this is hell)
You can run and you can hide
But it's all in your mind
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out (this is hell)
(This is hell)
(This is hell)
What's so wrong with being crazy?
It's so much fun when you're insane
I try to hide above my madness
But I love it, keep it comin'
So here's a cheers to all the outcasts
Let's get lost in fantasy
Celebrated being fucked up
But there's no worry, it's only hurting me
We're running up against the wall
If we keep on pushing, we can make it fall
There's nothing left to lose at all
So give in to all the pain
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out
Nobody's gonna save us
Can't you see that this is our fate now (this is hell)
You can run and you can hide
But it's all in your mind
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out
This is hell
I can't escape this hell
I can't take it anymore
So do it again and again 'cause I can't fuckin' breathe
When did this all begin?
So sick of playing pretend
I'm not me anymore, I need this shit to end
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out
Nobody's gonna save us
Can't you see that this is our fate now (this is hell)
You can run and you can hide
But it's all in your mind
Welcome to the chaos
No, there's never gonna be a way out
This is hell
(This is hell)
This is hell
