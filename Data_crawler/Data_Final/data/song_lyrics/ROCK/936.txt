Song Name: Love And Affection
You got the fire, baby
I got the heat, can you handle it?
I got the time, baby
You got the need, oh, surrender it
Oh, it's a passion crime
With a danger sign
Oh, can you handle it? Yeah
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Whoa-whoa, yeah
Don't gimme love and affection
Or what you think it should be
Don't gimme love, the wrong reason, yeah
It don't matter to me
I got the heart, baby
You got the beat, take a chance on me
We got the night, baby
We got the dream, oh, imagine it
Oh, it's a passion crime
With a danger sign
Oh, can you handle it? Yeah
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Whoa-whoa, yeah
Don't gimme love and affection
Or what you think it should be
Don't gimme love, the wrong reason, yeah
It don't matter to me
I don't need your understandin'
Oh babe, can't you understand me
C'mon try it and see
Oh, it's a passion play
In a different way
Oh, can you handle it? Yeah
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Whoa-whoa, yeah
Don't gimme love and affection, no
Or what you think it should be
Don't gimme love, the wrong reason, yeah
It don't matter to me, oh
I don't need your understandin'
Oh babe, can't you understand me
I don't need it (I don't need)
Don't need your heart (I don't need)
No understandin' (I don't need)
No affection (whoa, don't give me love)
Don't give me love and affection (I don't need)
Don't gimme love (I don't need)
Gimme what you got, oh
I don't need the wrong reason
I don't need it (I don't need) don't need it, oh
I don't need your understandin'
I don't need
Don't give me love and affection
Gimme all you got (I don't need)
