Song Name: Trying To Get To You - Second 'Sit-Down' Show - Live
I've been traveling over miles
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.
I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all you put me through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.
