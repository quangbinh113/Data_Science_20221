Song Name: Dance Devil Dance
Step inside the circle
Jump and turn around
Bleed for the blood ritual
And jump and turn around
Jump and turn around
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh oh oh, come on
Oh, come on
I am one of many
My name is forbidden
My name must stay hidden
I am Armageddon
I am one of many
I'm Satan, I'm freedom
I'm strictly forbidden
I'm Satan, I'm freedom
One candle remains
Step into the dark
One candle remains
Step into the dark
Dance, dance
Dance devil, dance
Draw the hidden symbol
Step and spin around
Whisper the unspeakable
Then step and spin around
Step and spin around
Oh, come on
I am one of many
My name is forbidden
My name must stay hidden
I am Armageddon
I am one of many
I'm Satan, I'm freedom
I'm strictly forbidden
I'm Satan, I'm freedom
One candle remains
Step into the dark
One candle remains
Step into the dark
Dance, dance
Dance devil, dance
One candle remains
Step into the dark
One candle remains
Step into the dark
Dance, dance
Dance devil, dance
