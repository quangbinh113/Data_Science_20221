Song Name: Don't Go Away
Cold and frosty morning
There's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind

And as the day was dawning
My plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind
I don't wanna be there when you're...
Coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day...
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time, yes I need more time
Just to make things right
Damn my situation
And the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education
I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind
Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong
