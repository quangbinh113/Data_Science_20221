Song Name: Change
Let me change
Let me run through the desert plains
There's nothing left to explain
On my knees begging for the rain
In my blue car
On the highway
Scrape the thin road
Fog in the valley
Let me change
Let me run through the desert plains
Let me be
I can see all I wanna see
Birds without wings in the tree
Tell me how it is actually
There's nothing I
I can do to make you lie
Your truth is all you need to ride
Let me change
Let me run through the desert plains
There's nothing left to explain
On my knees begging for the rain
