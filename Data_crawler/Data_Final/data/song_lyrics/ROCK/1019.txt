Song Name: I Stole Your Love
Alright, I remember the day that we met
I needed someone, you needed someone too, yeah
Spend time takin' all you could get
Givin' yourself was one thing, you never could do
You played with my heart
Played with my head
I got to laugh
When I think of the things you said
'Cause I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
'Cause I, oh yeah, stole your love, I stole your love
Stole your love, I stole your love
You never stop runnin' around
You pick me up, then you could still put me down
You were the girl that nobody could own
Stay for a while, then you would leave me alone
I'm somethin' different
Ain't like the rest
How does it feel
To find out you're failin' your test?
'Cause I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
'Cause I, I, stole your love, I stole your love
Stole your love, I stole your love
Listen, I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
'Cause I, I, stole your love, I stole your love
Stole your love, I stole your love
I stole your love, stole your love
I stole your love, stole your love
I stole your love, oh
I, oh yeah, stole your love, I stole your love
Stole your love, I stole your love

I, oh yeah, stole your love
Oh yeah, stole your love, alright.
