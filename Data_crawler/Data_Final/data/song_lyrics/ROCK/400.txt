Song Name: Truth Or Dare
I like the way you look at me
And find the problems that I fail to see
It's searing into my mind (Searing into my mind)
The thoughts that I don't have the strength to find,
She can do better and she knows it
She can do better than me (Do better than me)
She can do better and she knows it
She can do better than me
Keep your secrets close enough to you
As I live on the inside
Truth or dare
What ya gonna choose? (Truth or dare)
Woahhh
You're playing me and I can see
The kind of man that I'm supposed to be
It's seared into my mind (Seared into my mind)
The thoughts that I don't have the strength to find
She can do better and she knows it
She can do better than me (Do better than me)
Yeah, she can do better and she knows it
She can do better than me, ohh
Keep your secrets close enough to you
As I live on the inside
Truth or dare
What ya gonna choose? (Truth or dare)
Cos I'll been doing fine, I'll been doing fine
You've been on my mind, you've been on my mind
This time, this time
Things were going right, going right
As I live, as I live on the inside
As I live on the inside
Keep your secrets close enough to you
As I live on the inside
Truth or dare, what ya gunna choose? (Are you gunna choose?)
Keep your secrets close enough to you
As I live on the inside
Truth or dare
What ya gonna choose? (Truth or dare)
Cos I'll been doing fine, I'll been doing fine
You've been on my mind, you've been on my mind
This time, this time
Things were going right, going right... (As I live as I live on the inside)
