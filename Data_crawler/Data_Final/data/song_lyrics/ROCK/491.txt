Song Name: Dirt off Your Shoulder / Lying From You
I ordered a frappuccino
Where's my fuckin' frappuccino?
Alright, let's do this
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you've always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cuz I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls
All the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom to bottom to the top of the pops
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a runnin' back, get it, man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga 'cuz I'm straight with the Roc
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen wit soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But like fifty-two cards, when I'm, I'm through dealin'
Now, fifty-two bars come out, now, you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case fifty-two broads come out, now, you chillin'
With a boss, bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
Paid a grip for the jeans, plus, the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in
And now you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push the more I'm pullin' away
'Cuz I'm lying my way from you
No, no turnin' back, now
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go)
No, no turnin' back, now
(Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone)
No turnin' back, now
(Anywhere on my own 'cuz I can see)
No, no turnin' back, now
(The very worst part of you)
(The very worst part of you is me)
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought
That what I said would have you runnin' from me like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought
That what I said would have you runnin' from me like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought
That what I said would have you runnin' from me like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought
That what I said would have you runnin' from me like this
You, no turnin' back, now
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go)
No, no turnin' back, now
(Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone)
No turnin' back, now
(Anywhere on my own 'cuz I can see)
No, no turnin' back, now
(The very worst part of you)
(The very worst part of you is me)
Beeitch
