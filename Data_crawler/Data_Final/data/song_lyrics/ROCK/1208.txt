Song Name: Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da - Remastered 2009
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers stores
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on, yeah
In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Yes, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
Hey, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Yeah, happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on, brah
La-la how the life goes on
And if you want some fun
Take ob-la-di ob-la-da
