Song Name: I Still Love You
You tell me that you're leavin'
And I'm trying to understand
I had myself believing
I could take it like a man
But if you gotta go
Then you gotta know that it's killin' me
And all the things I never seem to show
I gotta make you see
Girl, it's been so long
Then tell me, tell me how could it be?
No one of us knows
Two of us don't belong in each other's company?
It hurts so much inside, your telling me goodbye
You wanna be free
You're knowin' that you're gone and leavin' me behind
I gotta make you see
Gotta make you see, I gotta make you see
That I still love you, I love you
Oh, I really, I really love you
I still love you
Yeah, people tell me, I should win at any cost
But now I see as the smoke clears away
The battle's been lost, lost
I see it in your eyes, you never have to lie
I'm out of your life
Tonight I'll dream away and you can still be mine
But I'm dreamin' a lie
Dreamin' a lie
Makes me wanna die
'Cause I still love you, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you, I still love you
And when I think of all the things you'll never know
There's so much left to say
'Cause girl, I see the price of losin' you, will be my half to pay
My half to pay, each and every day,
Hear what I say
I still
I still, oh
I still

Love you, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I love
I love you
I love you
I really love you

(Paul Stanley)
