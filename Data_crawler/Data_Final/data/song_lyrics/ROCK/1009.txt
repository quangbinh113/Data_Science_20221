Song Name: Shandi
I just can't pretend no more, I keep runnin' out of lies
Lovin' you is killin' me inside
Every time I find the words to end it
Something in your eyes won't let it
Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Forever we say good night and go home
But you know me very well and I know you
You can't tell me good night (say good night)
We been holding on so tight, we're afraid to let it go
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride
Here's another mess I got myself in
And when you touch me you ain't helpin'
Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Forever we say good night and go home
But you know me very well and I know you
You can't tell me good night (say good night)
Say good night when we should say good bye, oh yeah
Shandi, tonight must last us forever and ever
Forever we say good night and go home
Shandi, Shandi, tonight must last us forever
