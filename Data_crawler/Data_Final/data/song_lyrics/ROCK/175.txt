Song Name: Rain Down
We've been reborn, we're the new generation
Solence MK2 now without limitation
Used to be afraid but turned that into power
Come light, come light, come rain and thunder
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Rain down
Rain down
We've had enough, we woke up from our sleep
We got up, made a drink, now we're back on our feet
It's been a lot (It's been a lot), but you better believe
And I won't let, I won't let that get the best of me
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
Water flows from my tired eyes
You can pray for your sins but it is over now
Now we're free, we gon' celebrate
We have finally made it through all the mist and haze
And the skies started pouring down
And for the first time in forever I feel so alive
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Rain down, let it rain on me
Wash off all the misery
Sky fall, let it rain on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
