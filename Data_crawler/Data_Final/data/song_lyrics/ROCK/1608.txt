Song Name: Should I Stay or Should I Go - Remastered
Whoa
(Ah, parlar)
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'til the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine and next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know
This indecision's bugging me (indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (si no me quieres, líbrame)
Exactly whom am I supposed to be? (¿Dime que tengo que ser?)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (¿Sabes qué ropan me quedan?)
Come on and let me know (me lo tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (¿Me debo ir o quedarme?)
Ahh
Split
(Doble!)
(Yo me enfrío o lo sufro)
(Es verdad)
Should I stay or should I go now? (¿Yo me enfrio o lo soplo?)
Should I stay or should I go now? (¿Yo me enfrio o lo soplo?)
If I go there will be trouble (si me voy, va a haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (si me quedo, es doble)
So you gotta let me know (pero que tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (¿Me frío o lo soplo?)
Should I stay or should I go now? (¿Me frío o lo soplo?)
If I go there will be trouble (si me voy, va a haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (si me quedo, es doble)
So you gotta let me know (pero que tienes que decir)
Should I stay or should I go?
