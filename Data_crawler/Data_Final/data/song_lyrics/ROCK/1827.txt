Song Name: Heroes And Villains - Remastered 2001
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the Heroes and Villains
Once at night Cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of Heroes and Villains
Heroes and Villains
Just see what you've done-done
Heroes and Villains
Just see what you've done-done
Na, na, na
La, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Stand or fall, I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the Heroes and Villains
My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago, head to toe
Healthy, wealthy, and wise
(Boys and girls and boys and girls)
I've been in this town so long
So, long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff, to ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff, I'm alright
By the Heroes and
Heroes and Villains
Just see what you've done-done
Heroes and Villains
Just see what you've done-done
