Song Name: Comin' Under Fire
Your kind of woman got a heart of stone
But watch it break when I get you alone
Take a chance, come lay down with me
Oh, I wanna make it
Slow and steady never lost the race
Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase
Play the game, surrender to me
Baby, I don't wanna fake it
Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?
Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire
It's so easy to put on a show
Your body says yes but you won't let it go
My passion it won't slip away
Oh, am I going crazy?
Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?
Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire (Under fire)
You got me comin', under fire
You got me comin', under fire
Oh yeah, I'm comin', under fire
Your body says yes, but baby, please let it go
Let it go, uh, yeah
You got me, I'm comin' my back to the wall
No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all
I'm walkin' the wire, I stumble and fall
I got my message but I ain't gonna crawl
Is it any wonder?
You got me comin' under fire
Comin' like thunder
You know you make me walk the wire
Is it any wonder (is it any wonder)
You got me comin' under fire?
Comin' like thunder (comin' like thunder)
You know you make me walk the wire
Under fire
You got me comin, under fire
You got me comin', under fire
Oh yeah, I'm comin', under fire
Oh yeah, I'm comin', under fire
