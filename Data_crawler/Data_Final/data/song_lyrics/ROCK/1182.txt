Song Name: Stay Young - Remastered
One way out is all you're ever goin' to get
From those who hand them out don't never let it upset you
'Cause they'll put words into your mouths
They're making you feel so ashamed
They're makin' you takin' the blame
They're makin' you cold in the night
They're makin' you question your heart and your soul
And I think that it's not quite right
Hey stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Feed your head with all the things you need when you're hungry
And stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday
'Cause they'll put words into my mouth
They're making it feel so ashamed
They're makin' me takin' the blame
They're makin' me cold in the night
They're makin' me question my heart and my soul
And I think that it's not quite right
Hey stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Hey stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Hey stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may my faith's unshakeable
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
' Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
