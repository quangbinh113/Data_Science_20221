Song Name: Seventh Sun
A child is born, a man has died
A mother sings a lullaby
The world belongs to the young ones
Take your dreams and find the seventh sun
The blackbird sings a melody
As innocent as it can be
Your inner freedom's shining on
Take your love and find the seventh sun
Your innermost freedom's shining on
To lead the way to the seventh sun
The sun is throwing shadows
You're burning if you come too close
Even if your soul is old
A million years
Time traveler, here and now
The ones who're gone are still around
Your heart and soul will be one
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
Your inner freedom's shining on
To lead the way to the seventh sun
A child is born, a man has died
A time of joy, a time to cry
The voice of loss, the only one
Your soul will always shine in the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
Your innermost freedom's shining on
To lead the way to the seventh sun
The sun is throwing shadows
You're burning if you come too close
Even if your soul is old
A million years
Time traveler, here and now
The ones who're gone are still around
Your heart and soul will be one
In the seventh sun
Your innermost freedom's shining on
To lead the way to the seventh sun
The sun is throwing shadows
You're burning if you come too close
Even if your soul is old
A million years
Time traveler, here and now
The ones who're gone are still around
Your heart and soul will be one
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
Yeah, in the seventh sun
Oh yeah, in the seventh sun
In the seventh sun
