Song Name: TV Screen - "Arizona Dream" Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Find a beautiful old street
Not rushing through this time
In a bar where a fat lady reigns supreme
Come in and drink with a false name
In circus clothes forget their pain
They are the zombie bodies
Caught in the glow of the TV screen
Just forget it?
Forget it all
The TV screen
TV screen makes you feel small
No life at all
Now that you have turned it off
It's harder than you thought
No one wants to give a damn
Or even hear a thought
They rush from one fad to the next
You talk and it has no effect
You are the target for stars
And the planets on the TV screen
Just forget it?
Forget it all
The TV screen
TV screen makes you feel small
No life at all
