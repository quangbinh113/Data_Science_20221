Song Name: Save Me - Remastered 2011
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years believe we lived a lie
I love you till I die
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked, and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head, and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, ooh
I'm naked, and I'm far from home
Each night, I cry, I still believe the lie
I love you till I die
Ow!
Save me, save me, save me (Oh, yeah!)
Yeah, save me, yeah, save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh (Save me)
I'm naked, and I'm far from home
