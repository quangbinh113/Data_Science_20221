Song Name: Cartoon Earthquake - Spotify Singles
You wanna put me in your pocket
And take me around
But I'll get heavy
You'll have to put me down
You picked me in the first place
You could buckle under the weight
It's a real thing now
Real thing now
If a rock hit the ground
And split like a hairline fracture
A cartoon earthquake now
It's me that you'd run after
Jump that gap
To get to my half
I wanna trust that
Put the power in the circuit
And feel it all
Light up from me
And then drop the bomb
I'm over the two thousands
It hurts less when you know about it, don't start
It's a real thing now
Real thing now
If a rock hit the ground
And split like a hairline fracture
A cartoon earthquake now
It's me that you'd run after
And jump that gap
To get to my half
I wanna trust that
But you control my centre
I wish we'd put it right
You had your own big dog
All by yourself, if you're around
At the wrong time
At the wrong time
If a rock hit the ground
And split like a hairline fracture
A cartoon earthquake now
It's me that you'd run after
Jump that gap
To get to my half
I wanna trust that
