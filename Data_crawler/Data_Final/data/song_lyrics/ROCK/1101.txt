Song Name: Under The Same Sun
I saw the morning
It was shattered by a gun
Heard a scream, saw him fall
No one cried
I saw a mother
She was praying for her son
Bring him back, let him live
Don't let him die
Do you ever ask yourself
There's a heaven in the sky
Why can't we get it right?
'Cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon, yeah
Then why, why
Can't we live as one
I saw the evening
Fading shadows one by one
Watch the lamb, lay down to
The sacrifice
I saw the children
Children of the sun
How they wept
How they bled
How they died
Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a heaven in the sky
Why can't we stop the fight?
'Cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon, yeah
Then why, why
Can't we live as one
Sometimes I think I'm going mad
We're loosing all we had
And no one seems to care
But in my heart it doesn't change
We've got to rearrange
And bring our world some love
And does it really matter
There's a heaven up above
We sure could use some love
'Cause we all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars
Then why, why
Can't we live as one
'Cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon, yeah
We all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars, yeah
Then why, tell me why
Can't we live as one
