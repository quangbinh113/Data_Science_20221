Song Name: Out of My Head
I don't really like it when we fight
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Why we gotta do this every night?
Every night
Slow down
Clever how you get me by myself
Twisting all my words and I'm like, "Hell nah"
I'm close to getting better, can you tell?
Can you tell?
Get out of my head
You pushed me over the edge
I'm falling over, and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Get out of my head
I wasted all of my breath
I'm losing, over and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
I'ma have to put the blame on you
'Cause each and every way you bend the
Truth is useless
Stupid, it's too bad
I bet it all
Honey, I threw it all in
You say it's my fault
You don't give me an option
I'm tryin' to save this
You said be patient
If you want it all then just take it (please)
Get out of my head
You pushed me over the edge
I'm falling over, and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Get out of my head
I wasted all of my breath
I'm losing, over and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
I bet it all
Honey, I threw it all in
You say it's my fault
You don't give me an option
I'm tryin' to save this
You said be patient
If you want it all then just take it, please
Get out of my head
You pushed me over the edge
I'm falling over, and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Get out of my head
I wasted all of my breath
I'm losing, over and over, and over again
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
