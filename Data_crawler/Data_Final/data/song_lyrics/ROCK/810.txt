Song Name: Wanted Dead Or Alive
It's all the same
Only the names will change
Everyday
It seems we're wasting away
Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their seperate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
All you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted)
Dead or alive
Wanted (wanted)
Dead or alive
Oh, I ride
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted)
Dead or alive
I walk these streets
A loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps
'Cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, oh yeah
Still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces
And I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted)
Dead or alive
But I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
