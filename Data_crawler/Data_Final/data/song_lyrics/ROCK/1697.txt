Song Name: Sunday
This house is as slick as a senator statement
This job is a masquerade of recreation
Like a wreck, I'm sinking fast
The key to everything I crawl for Sunday
When I don't have to move
Caught up in dreams untangled one day
Where I don't have to prove
The days roll on and finally Sunday
A Sunday afternoon
I've got it all, but what's it for
But getting some more
(Always ready, always steady)
(Always ready, always steady)
This street is as cold as a corporate lawsuit
A pride I confide is telling me to wipe my boot
I'm a wreck, what did he expect
The key to everything I crawl for Sunday
When I don't have to move
Caught up in dreams untangled one day
Where I don't have to prove
The days roll on and finally Sunday
A Sunday afternoon
I've got it all, and so what now
Do what they say, and you do what they say, go back
Do what they say, and you do what they say, go back
Do what they say, and do what they say
Til Sunday
Until I'm black and blue
Oh what can I do
Always ready, always steady
Always ready, always steady
All I need in the end is killing me and you
All I need in the end is killing me and you
All I need in the end is killing me and you
All I need in the end is killing me and you
All I need in the end is killing me and you
All I need in the end is killing me and you
