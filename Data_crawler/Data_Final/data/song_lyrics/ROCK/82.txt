Song Name: Past Lives
Drained fountains
Counting footsteps out of sync
Truth running bow line
Out a sheepshank
Tied two tin cans together
I hear the whistle blowing
Mississippi, one and two
I got the comment section grammar correction blues
I hear the numbers calling
Mississippi, three and four
Reject the influence
Reject the influenza
I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it
There's no use giving up
I know we can get well
I know we can get well
Faced, outlined
Covered fingerprints under dust
I fear some indecisions exercise my lazy eye
You'll burn the comment section grammar correction bile
We count the scalp coming in dissection of the trial
Reject the influence
Reject the influenza
I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it
There's no use giving up
I know we can get well
I know we can get well
What difference would it make?
Outlining the rest, just to see how long it lasts
You're afraid of them
Bury me in the comment section
I belong to this
I hope that you will never have to feel the scissor ocular correct
What difference would it make?
I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it
There's no use giving up
I know we can get well
I know we can get well
(I can't take it back, I can't take it back)
I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it
There's no use giving up
I know we can get well
I know we can get well
