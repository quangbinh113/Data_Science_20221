Song Name: Only Love Can Save Me Now (feat. Matt Cameron & Kim Thayil)
Heaven's falling out of the sky
Sends a message to you and I
See people crawling out of their trees
Chained to sickness, the dogs are free
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
From the sound, the sound
The world is spitting out
Only love can save me now
Gone so down, lost is all I found
Only love, love, love can save me now
Drowning madly in deep blue seas
Waves of sadness swallow me
No soul can hear me beneath the weight
No gods or saviors, no hands of fate
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
From the sound, the sound
The world is spitting out
Only love can save me now
Gone so down, lost is all I found
Only love, love, love can save me now
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved

From the sound, the sound
The world is spitting out
Only love can save me now
Gone so down, lost is all I found
Only love, love, love can save me now
