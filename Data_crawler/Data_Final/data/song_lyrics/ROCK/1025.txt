Song Name: Brown Sugar - 2009 Remaster
Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in the market down in New Orleans
Skydog slaver know he's doin' all right
Hear him whip the women, just around midnight
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good?
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should, oh no
Drums beatin' cold, English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doin' all right
You should have heard him, just around midnight
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good?
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should, yeah
Brown Sugar, how come you dance so good?
Oh, got me quittin'
Brown Sugar, just like a black girl should, yeah
Now, I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet 16
I'm no school boy but I know what I like
You should have heard them, just around midnight
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good? Oh, no no
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
How come you, how come you dance so good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
Just like a, just like a black girl should
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
