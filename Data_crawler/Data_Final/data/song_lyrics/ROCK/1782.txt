Song Name: Hard as a Rock
A rollin' rock
Electric shocks
It gives a lickin' that don't stop
She line 'em up
Push you round
Smokin' rings, going 'round and 'round
Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behaviour
Will leave you standing proud
Hard as a rock
Hard as a rock
Well it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well it's harder than a rock
The lightnin' rod
Strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty it's darn right mean
Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No I ain't gonna take it
I'm bustin' out
Hard as a rock
Hard as a rock
Well it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yes it's harder than a rock yeah
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
I'm getting' harder
Harder than a rock
Well I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Baby I'm harder than a rock yeah
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Guess I'm harder, harder, harder, harder than a rock
