Song Name: The Acolyte
Logic and reason won't wear you down like I would
And all the other people saying
To just keep sipping on ionized water
Managed to take a real look at my choices
A decade's worth of insolence it's fucked up
But I still find myself choked up
Won't just forget it
Can't seem to shake it my mind is
Caught up on being
Unsustainable
You take my breath away
Oh wait
Please don't turn your back on me
I promise to get better
You thought
You could trust your woman but she's just
Touched up
Won't just forget it
Can't seem to shake it my mind is
Caught up on being
Unsustainable
Counting all the blessings
Eggs in one basket
I just want
To wake up next to you
Don't try to tempt me
Either way I'm still breaking your heart
Your heart
