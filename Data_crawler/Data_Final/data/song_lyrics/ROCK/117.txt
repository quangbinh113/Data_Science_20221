Song Name: The Foreverlost
We'll never run out of moons to howl to
Between the shadow and shade of love
(Here's to the pouring rain)
Flare gun without now, darling
With those sad aggro eyes
(To this melodic moment, oh)
Of the morning tide
Suicide by love's night vision heart
I don't wanna die but I can't stay
Forever, the foreverlost
Forever lost in you
Forever, the foreverlost
Forever lost in you
We keep whistling the devil's tritone as
The necropolis of love in the dark
(Here's to night etеrnal)
Myth of our Shangri-la
Nonstop, finish the lead of thе heart
(Hope meant my fold, baby)
Moon dialed it up, sun dialed it down
Dance the decay on the haunting ground
Moon dialed it up, sun dialed it down
Come dance the decay now and then down
Suicide by love's night vision heart
I'm not ready to die but it's getting late
Forever, the foreverlost
Forever lost in you
Forever, the foreverlost
Forever lost in you
Forever, the foreverlost
Forever lost in you
Forever, the foreverlost
I am forever lost in you
I'm forever lost in you
Forever lost in you
(Lost in you, lost in you, lost in you, lost in you)
