Song Name: No More Cloudy Days
Sitting by a foggy window
Staring at the pouring rain
Falling down like lonely teardrops
Memories of love in vain
These cloudy days
Make you want to cry
It breaks your heart when someone leaves
And you don't know why
I can see that you've been hurting
Baby I've been lonely too
I've been out here lost and searching
Looking for a girl like you
Now I believe the sun is gonna shine
Don't you be afraid to love again
Put your hand in mine
Baby
I would never make you cry
I would never make you blue
I would never let you down
I would never be untrue
I know a place
Where we can go
Where true love always stays
There's no more stormy nights
No more cloudy days
I believe in second chances
I believe in angels too
I believe in new romances
Baby I believe in you
These cloudy days
Are coming to an end
And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again
Baby
I would never make you cry
I would never make you blue
I would never turn away
I would never be untrue
I know a place
Where we can go
Where true love always stays
There's no more stormy nights
No more cloudy days
