Song Name: Jailbreak
There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him 16 years in Hell
He said "I ain't spending my life here"
"I ain't living alone"
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and headin' home
Gonna make a (jailbreak)
And I'm lookin' towards the sky
I'm gonna make a (jailbreak)
Oh, how I wish that I could fly
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free
(Jailbreak) Let me out of here
(Jailbreak) 16 years, oh, whoo
(Jailbreak) Had more than I can take
(Jailbreak) Yeah
He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand
Oh, bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
I got to break out
Out of here
Heartbeats they were racin'
Freedom, he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens
Rifles firing
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
