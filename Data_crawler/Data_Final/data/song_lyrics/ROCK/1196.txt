Song Name: I Am the Walrus - Live at Knebworth, 11 August '96
I am he, as you are he
As you are me, and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly, I'm crying!
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation t-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long
I am the egg man (who)
They are the egg men (who)
I am the walrus
Goo, goo, goo, joob
Mister City, policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly, like Lucy in the sky
See how they run, I'm crying
I'm crying
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
I am the egg man (who)
They are the egg men (who)
I am the walrus
Goo, goo, goo, joob
Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the Sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man (who)
They are the egg men (who)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide, I'm crying
Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them, kicking Edgar Allen Poe
I am the egg man (who)
They are the egg men (who)
I am the walrus
Goo, goo, goo, joob
Goo, goo, goo, goo, joob
Goo, goo, goo, joob
Joob, joob, joob
Joob, joob, joob
Joob, joob, joob
Joob, joob, joob
Joob, joob, joob
