Song Name: Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so bad
You're so bad you're so bad
You think you're in love
Like it's a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now it's ooh baby please
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
We were making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone elses name
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what i want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees
You're so bad you're so bad you're so bad
You're so bad you're so bad
Chip off the old block
Man you're so much like your sister
My fantasize it must be out of luck
My old labido has been blowing a transistor
I feel like i have been hit by a fuck
Yeah
I'm jones' in' on love
Yeah i got the dt's
You say that we will but there ain't no guarentees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
What are you looking for
It's got to be hard core
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
You're so bad you're so bad you're so bad
You're so bad you're so bad
You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way i hold the microphone
Sometimes i good but when i'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what i want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone and your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees
I'm jones' in' on love
Yeah i got the dt's
You say that we will yeah
But there ain't no gurantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
