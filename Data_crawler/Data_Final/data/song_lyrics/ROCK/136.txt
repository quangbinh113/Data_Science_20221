Song Name: Until We Break (feat. Matty Mullins of Memphis Mayfire)
Break
You're the cause of the hate and the violence
The pain and the silence, yeah, and all we need to do is
Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe
You're the heart of the fate that divides us
A plague and a virus, yeah, and all we need to do is
Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe, so
Smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one until we break
We can run, but it's always behind us
We hide, but it finds us, yeah, and all we need to do is
Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe, so
Smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one until we
Ashes to ashes, we all fall
Burn it down, light the flame
Bury your head till it goes away
Smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one until we break
Smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one until we break
