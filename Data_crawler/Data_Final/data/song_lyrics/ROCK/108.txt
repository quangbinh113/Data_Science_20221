Song Name: One of Those Days (feat. Eric Clapton)
Disarray and burning nations
Dancing in the smoke
Getting high on suffocation
Better not to know (yeah)
Hey, hey, have I lost my mind?
Killing myself but I never die
It's one of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No, no
Hey, hey, have I lost control?
Drinking my sins, never drown my soul
One of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No, no, no
Lay me down on broken bottles
Let me see my blood
Love you now but not tomorrow
Be afraid of what's to follow
Hey, hey, have I lost my mind?
Killing myself but I never die
It's one of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No, no
Hey, hey, have I lost control?
Drinking my sins, never drown my soul
One of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No
Hey, hey, have I lost my mind?
Killing myself but I never die
It's one of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No, no
Hey, hey, have I lost control?
Drinking my sins never drown my soul
It's one of those days that I don't believe in Jesus
No, no, no
Don't believe in Jesus
No, no, no
Don't believe in Jesus
No
