Song Name: Landlord
Aaa, aaa
I don't want to rent a house from you
I don't know how you can expect me to?
I ain't movin' 'cause I know my rights
Too many homeless on the streets at night
You own a street and a block of flats
You earn your livin' like the other rats
You've no morality, what do you care?
You deal in property, you buy despair
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
You go and call yourself a business man
You're just a parasite on pulassan
You're just a middle class middle aged shit
You sold your granny for a three penny bit
You own a street and a block of flats
You earn your livin' like the other rats
You've no morality, what do you care?
You deal in property, you buy despair
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
Wuh
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
You go and call yourself a business man
You're just a parasite on pulassan
You're just a middle class, middle aged shit
You sold your granny for a three penny bit
You own a street and a block of flats
You earn your livin' like the other rats
You've no morality, what do you care?
You deal in property, you buy despair
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
Oh
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
I ain't movin' 'till the bailiff comes
I've got no weapons, gonna get me some
Oh
Yea, yea
Yea, yea
Hah
Yea, yea
Yeah, li li li la
