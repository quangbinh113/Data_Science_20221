You don't fool me, those pretty eyes
That sexy smile, you don't fool me, uh
You don't rule me, you're no surprise
You're telling lies, hey, you don't fool me

Mmm, mama said be careful of that girl
Mama said you know that she's no good
Mama said be cool, don't you be no fool
Yup bup ba ba ba ba da da da dah

You don't fool me, and break you
Sooner or later, you'll be playing by her rules
Baby, you don't fool me, yeah
You don't fool me

You don't have to say 'don't mind'
You don't have to teach me things I know
Sooner or later, you'll be playing by her rules
Oh (Fool you) oh (Rule you) she'll take you (Take you)
