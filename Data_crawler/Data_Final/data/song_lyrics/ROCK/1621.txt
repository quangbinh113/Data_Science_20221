Song Name: Brand New Cadillac - Remastered
Drive
Drive
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes, she did
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said, "Hey, come here, daddy"
I ain't never comin' back
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Yeah, come on, sugar, just come on back to me
She said, "Balls to you, big daddy"
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh, oh, come on, just hear my plea
She said, "Balls to you, daddy"
She ain't comin' back to me
Oh God
Baby, baby, drove up in a Cadillac
I said, "Jesus Christ, where'd you get that Cadillac?"
She said, "Balls to you, daddy"
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't, she ain't comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
