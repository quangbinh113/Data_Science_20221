Song Name: Really Good Song
Been trying to sneak one in
I watch the neighbours curtains twitch
On the hour
Down at the local spot
The toilet stalls, you talk a lot
'What a shower!'
Out in the cold daylight
You're stumbling we're probably
Losing power
Tried putting on bets again
The bastards wouldn't let me in
'Paddy Power
I've got my foot in the doorway
The youngfella's recoiling
From my rictus of joy
Buddy boy I'm having
The time of my life
In the lounge
On the street
A pair of Tony Sopranos
Covering eachother in wet concrete
Man are you having a good time?
Man are you having a good time?
I should be having a good time
I should be having a good time
Man are you having a good time?
Man are you having a good time?
I should be having a good time
This band is called Really Good Time
I hope you're having one
