Song Name: EARTHBOUND
Lost in the background
We hide
Crashed out, we're earthbound
So bright (So bright)
I hope you stay
Until there's nothing left
Don't leave it left unsaid
I'll find a way
To let these secrets out
No time for slowing down now
Stand up, you've grown up
So cool (Oh, woah, woah)
All gone, we'll move on
Like fools (Oh, woah, woah)
I hope you stay
Until there's nothing left
Don't leave it left unsaid
I'll find a way
To let these secrets out
No time for slowing down
I hope you stay
Until there's nothing left
Don't leave it left unsaid
I'll find a way
To let these secrets out
No time for slowing down
