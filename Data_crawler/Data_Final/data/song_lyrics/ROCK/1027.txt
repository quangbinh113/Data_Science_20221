Song Name: Turn On The Night
Everyone's thinkin' they're so hot tonight
But there's a fire in your eyes
Everyone wants you girl, but I want you more
Than any other guy
You got what I want, I got what you need
Fire below
So if you know it, show it
Don't let me go, woah
Turn on the night, I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night, yeah, I wanna feel this feeling get stronger
Take me in your arms, I'll take you into my heart
Let's bring this love to life
C'mon baby put your finger on the switch
Let's make some sparks ignite
Show me what you want, show me what you need
Fire below
C'mon and take me, shake me
Don't let me go, woah
Turn on the night, I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night, yeah, I wanna feel this feeling get stronger
Turn on the night, ooh woah, I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night, yeah, you know this feeling keeps getting stronger
Yeah, hey babe
You got what I want, I got what you need
Fire below
So if you know it, show it
Don't let me go, woah
Turn on the night, I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night, yeah, I wanna feel this feeling get stronger
Turn on the night, ooh woah, I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night, yeah, you know this feeling keeps getting stronger
Turn on the night
Turn on the night
Turn on the night
