Song Name: Face It Alone
When something so near and dear to life explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire

When something so deep and so far and wide falls down beside
Your cries can be heard so loud and clear, oh
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end
In the end
You have to face it all alone
When something so dear to your life explodes inside
You feel your soul is burned alive (burned alive)
When something so deep and so far and wide falls down beside
Your cries can be heard so loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end
In the end
You have to face it alone
When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da)
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da)
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone
