Song Name: Take It to the Limit - 2013 Remaster
All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might loved me
And I never knew

You know I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit
One more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in

Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit (please)
Take it to the limit (come on)
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit (please)
Take it to the limit (we gotta)
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit (please)
Take it to the limit (come on)
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit...
