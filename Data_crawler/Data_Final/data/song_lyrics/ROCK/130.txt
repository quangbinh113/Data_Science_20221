Song Name: Broken
I hate when I get left alone
I'm sure that all these calls are getting old
A short drive (a short drive), just get me home (just get me home)
The cost is nowhere near to what I owe
From the back of the car, it's sinking in
Like a shot of fear and adrenaline
I'm a lost cause with nothing left
Can't you see that?
My hands are torn up from all these broken bottles
I can't stand, lost too much
I know I've got my problems
I know I've got my problems
How did it start? (How did it start?)
This episode (this episode) has got me crawling and flying
I'm high and I'm low, oh
I watch from afar and make my bets
As you sit back and light a cigarette
A lost cause with nothing left
Can't you see that?
My hands are torn up from all these broken bottles
I can't stand, lost too much
I know I've got my problems
Every day I'm afraid that I might find the bottom
My hands are torn up
I know I've got my problems
I know I've got my problems
I know I've got my problems
Drink it down, I'm on empty
Shaking now, please don't worry
It surrounds all that I see
I'm on empty
My hands are torn up from all these broken bottles
I can't stand, lost too much
I know I've got my problems
Every day I'm afraid that I might find the bottom
My hands are torn up
I know I've got my problems
I've got my problems
I know I've got my problems
