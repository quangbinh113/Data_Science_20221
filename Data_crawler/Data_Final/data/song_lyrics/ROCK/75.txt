Song Name: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE MEANS
You don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
Know what love means
And it's killin' me
Holding on, spinning out
All my faith turns to doubts
Hopes and dreams, plans we had
Set ablaze, a burning crash
I hope you get all your shit back together
I hope you know only you can make you better
And there's a world in which the two of us can still be sane
You'll see, so let's be honest
Let's be honest
You don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
Don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
I tried and tried 'til it made me sick
Round and round, a toxic mix
Walls built up, you shut down
Ulcer grows, we'rе bleeding out
I hope you get all your shit back togethеr
I hope you know only you can make you better
Let's be honest
Yeah, let's be honest
You don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
Don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
We're colliding, losing hope
Can we make it further on our own?
We keep colliding and we're losin' hope
On a one-way street going down a broken road
Crashing endlessly
(I can't sleep, I can't eat
There's no rest and there's no peace)
So let's be honest
Let's be honest
Don't know what love means
And it's killin' me
Know what love means
And it's killin' me, yeah
We're colliding, losing hope
Can we make it further on our own?
We keep colliding and we're losin' hope
On a one-way street going down a broken road
Crashing endlessly
Crashing endlessly
We keep crashing (crashing)
We keep crashing endlessly
