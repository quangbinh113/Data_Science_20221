Song Name: New Era
Wake up every day thinking we could be great
Making waves, I'm tired of the same old thing
So today we will be brave, breaking chains
You're rolling with us or get out of the way
Give it all I have, there's no looking back
We are one, we are free, we are living the dream
We are done dealing with the hypocrisy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
We are one, we are free, we are liberty
We are done dealing with the bureaucracy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
Wake up every day thanking God for his grace
So I pray for anyone that needs a change
To a place where we are gracious, making changes
Moving on from the same old same
Give it all I have, there's no looking back
We are one, we are free, we are living the dream
We are done dealing with the hypocrisy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
We are one, we are free, we are liberty
We are done dealing with the bureaucracy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new era
Give it all I have, there's no looking back
There's no looking back
We are one, we are free, we are living the dream
We are done dealing with the hypocrisy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
We are one, we are free, we are liberty
We are done dealing with the bureaucracy
Welcome to the new
The new era
Welcome to the new
Welcome to the new era
Welcome to the new era
Welcome to the new
The new era
