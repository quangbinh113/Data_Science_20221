Song Name: Let's Go To Bed
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
Let me take your hands
I'm shaking like milk
Turning, turning blue
All over the windows and the floors
Fires outside in the sky
Looks as perfect as cats
The two of us together again
It's just the same - a stupid game
But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it if you won't say it first
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
You think you're tired now
But wait until three
Laughing at the Christmas lights
You remember from December
All of this then back again
Another girl, another name
Stay alive but stay the same
It's a stupid game, stupid game
But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't play it if you won't play it first
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
You can't even see now
So you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real
Because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway
And into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here
When I came here alone
But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't play it, if you won't play it first
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's go to bed!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's go to bed!
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Let's go to bed!
