Song Name: Surrender
You've always told me
That you know me
But you don't really know me at all (No)
You just played me
And betrayed me
And showed no sympathy at all
Why can't you just please surrender?
Surrender what you promised
Surrender what I need
Why can't you just see that sweet surrender in me?
One time
Surrender to me
So will you stand tall
And be accountable
And tell that little girl you lied? (oh no)
Oh, how you lost it
I'm so exhausted
And this is where I draw the line for the last time
Why can't you just surrender?
Surrender what you promised
Surrender what I need, oh baby
Why can't you just see that sweet surrender in me?
One time
Surrender to me
I'm done wastin' time
So sick of your lies
And every time you seem to change your mind
Manipulate
So quick to hate
A true master of your art, you demonstrate
But I need a break from you
I need to separate from you
I need to keep my faith and do
All the other things I promised to
Why'd you always make me wait on you?
I really need a break from you
I need to keep my faith and do
All the other things I promised to
I really need a break
I really need a break
I really need a break, break, break, break, break
Why can't you just please surrender?
Surrender what you promised
Surrender what I need, oh baby
Why can't you just see that sweet surrender in me?
One time
Surrender to me
Surrender to me
Surrender to me
