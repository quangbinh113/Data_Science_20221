Song Name: House of Cards
Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies
A half-moon away, way too close to heaven
She had the Iook, but no morality
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you'll regret eternally
Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away
How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down
It breaks your heart
When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards
It's so hard to find a way when life is in pieces
And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But the man who'll rise up from the ashes
Is no one else but me
I'm standing in a waterfall
To wash the lies away
How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down
It breaks your heart
House of cards
Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away
How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark
And no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down
And there is no one
When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards
