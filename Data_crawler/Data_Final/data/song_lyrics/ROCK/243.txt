Song Name: Key To The Highway - Piano Instrumental/Remastered 2009
I got the Key To The Highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
I'm going back to the border
Little girl, where I'm better known
'Cause you haven't done nothing
Drove a good man away from home
When the moon peek over the mountain
Little girl, I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roam this old highway
Until the break of day
Give me one more kiss darling
Little girl, just before I go
Because when I leave this time
I won't be back no more
I've got the Key To The Highway
Little darling, I got to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
