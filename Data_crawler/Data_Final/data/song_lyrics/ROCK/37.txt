Song Name: Jealousy
(La-la-la) jealousy is haunting me
So bad at biting my tongue
It gets so hard to breathe
Wish you were mine from day one
Don't mention any other name
That doesn't sound like mine, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
Who you've been with before
Burn all your old photos
They don't exist anymore
You know I'll never be replaced
'Cause I satisfy, ahh-ay, yeah
'Cause your smile tells me everything I need to know
You need to know that
It never ends
Look at the shade of my eyes
And I won't pretend
And I won't apologize
I gotta have you, gotta have you to myself
Why would I want anybody else?
In my defense
Jealousy's my best friend
(La-la-la) people like to shame me
You think that I care at all?
So bad at sharing
You know you infect my soul
Don't want it any other way
'Cause it gets you high, ahh-ay, yeah
I know I can't change the past
Better believe that I tried
Never meant to last
Makes me so happy inside
Come on my baby, time to play
'Cause you set me on fire, ahh-ay, yeah
It never ends
Look at the shade of my eyes
And I won't pretend
And I won't apologize
I gotta have you, gotta have you to myself
Why would I want anybody else?
In my defense
Jealousy's my best friend
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Jealousy's my best friend)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Jealousy's my best friend)
It never ends
Look at the shade of my eyes
And I won't pretend
And I won't apologize
I gotta have you, gotta have you to myself
Why would I want anybody else?
In my defense
Jealousy's my best friend
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Jealousy's my best friend)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh, yeah)
