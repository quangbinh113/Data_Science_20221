Song Name: Mannish Boy
Oh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Everythin' gon' be alright this mornin'
Now when I was young boy
At the age of five
My mother said I'ma be
The greatest man alive
But now I'm a man
I made 21
I want you to believe me, honey
We're having lots of fun
I'm a man (yeah)

That represents man (yeah)
No B, O, child, Y
That spell mannish boy
I'm a man (yeah)
I'm a full grown man (oh, yeah)
I'm a man (yeah)
I'm a rollin' stone (woo)

I'm a hoochie coochie man
Sittin' on the outside
Just me and my maid
I make the moon
Come up two hours late (yeah)
Wasn't that a man (yeah)

That represents man (yeah)
No B, O, child, Y
That spell mannish boy
I'm a man (yeah)

A full grown man
