Song Name: Cocaine
If you wanna hang out, you've gotta take her out
Cocaine
If you wanna get down, down on the ground
Cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
If you got that lose, you wanna kick them blues
Cocaine
When your day is done and you wanna run
Cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
If your day is gone and you wanna ride on
Cocaine

Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
