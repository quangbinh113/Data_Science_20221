Song Name: Judgement Day
One two one two
Ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch yeah!
I'm built for speed, wanna make you scream
Motor city madness gonna make you bleed
She's so tight, she's dynamite
Rollin down the Highway make you feel alright
Oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, alright
Buckle down better hold on tight
My 427 she's outta sight
Asphalt jungle beneath my seat
Smell my rubber when we hit the street
Oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, alright
It's coming down anytime any day
We're gonna ride, we're here to stay
You better run, you better hide, you better pray
Got the pedal down it's judgement day
She's coming now with a reptile tongue
It's burnin now, it's burnin strong
Octane boogie petrol fog
She's on your tail run like a dog
Oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, alright
It's coming down anytime anyday
We're gonna ride, we're here to stay
You better run, you better hide, you better pray
Got the pedal down it's judgement day
Ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch oh yeah!
It's coming down anytime any day
We're gonna ride, we're here to stay
You better run, you better hide, you better pray
Got the pedal down it's judgement day
Yeeaaah
Alright
Oh yeah
Alright
Oh yeah
It's judgement day
Oh yeah
Hahahahaha
