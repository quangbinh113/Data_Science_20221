Song Name: Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution
Alright!
Hey there, all you middlemen
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there sittin' on a fence
So get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock 'n' roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, just go
Ow
Ooh yeah
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations coming up from the floor
We're just listening to the rock that's giving too much noise
Are you deaf? You wanna hear some more?
We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive
Yes, it will, ha ha ha ha
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lying on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock 'n' roll instead
We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll, it's just rock 'n' roll
Oh, rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll, it'll never die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll
Oh, rock 'n' roll is just rock 'n' roll, yeah
