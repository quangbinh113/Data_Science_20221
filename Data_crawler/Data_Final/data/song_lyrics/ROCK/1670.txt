Song Name: Nightclubbing
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing
We're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances, brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
