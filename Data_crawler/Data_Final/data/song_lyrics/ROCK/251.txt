Song Name: Welcome To The Circus
Welcome to the circus
Welcome to the shit show, just another freak show
Hang your hat and hate at the door (door)
It's a game of torture, souls are made to order
Everything you wanted and more (more)
You've gotta kill somebody to thrill somebody
Everybody's gotta reason to bleed
You've gotta fuck somebody to know somebody
That motherfucker ain't me
Am I the only one that doesn't buy into the lies? (Lies)
Am I the only one that doesn't wear a disguise?
'Cause if I can't break it and I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one that isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus
Grab your favorite stones, they came for broken bones
That's what happens when you sign on the line (line)
There's no need for excuses, everybody loses
Only way you'll ever win is to die (die)
You've gotta burn somebody to learn somebody
Everybody's got a Jekyll and Hyde
You gotta curse somebody to hurt somebody
Everybody needs a reason to die
Am I the only one that doesn't buy into the lies? (Lies)
Am I the only one that doesn't wear a disguise?
'Cause if I can't break it and I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one that isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus
You gotta hide your face
(Sell them what they bought ya, teach them what they taught ya)
You gotta hide your veins
(This is how they gut ya, right before they cut ya)
You gotta hide your pain
(Ugly how they rule you, that's just how they screw you)
You gotta hide your rage
(Everyone has earned this, welcome to the circus...)
Tickey, tickey, tasket, time to burn the casket
Time to burn this motherfucker down
Am I the only one that doesn't buy into the lies? (Lies)
Am I the only one that doesn't wear a disguise? (Doesn't wear a disguise)
'Cause if I can't break it and I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one that isn't just here for the show? (Not just here for the-)
Am I?
Tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one that isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus
