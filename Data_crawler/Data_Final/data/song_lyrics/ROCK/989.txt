Song Name: Lick It Up
Yeah! Yeah!

Don't wanna wait 'til you know me better
Let's just be glad for the time together

Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it

There ain't a reason on earth to waste it
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
It's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Woo yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Come on, come on
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Don't need to wait for an invitation
You gotta live like you're on vacation
There's something sweet you can't buy with money
Lick it up (woah!) lick it up
It's all you need, so believe me honey
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
It's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Woo yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Come on, come on
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
C'mon
It's only right now
It's only right now
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
It's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Come on, come on
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Wooh!
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
