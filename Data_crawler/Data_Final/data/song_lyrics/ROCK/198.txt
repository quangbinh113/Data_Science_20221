Song Name: break me!
Every time you try to break me
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down
Taste you, and I breathe so deep
Heart beats hard, my knees go weak
Mouth glued shut, and I can't speak
Why does fear make me complete?
Little more lust, it's so addiction
I found love, for a quick minute
Trying to cope with self infliction
Drinking 'til I'm incoherent
Every time you try to break me
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down
Do-o-o-own
Do-o-o-own
Do-o-o-own
Break me down
You make my head spin crazy
You make my world go black
Even when my life gets hazy
I don't wanna die
A little more wind, from a little more speed
Tryna hold on, but it's pulling me
Side effects, they're killing me
Side effects, they're killing me
Every time you try to break me
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down
Do-o-o-own
Do-o-o-own
Do-o-o-own
Break me down
Little more lust and some addiction
I fell in love for a quick minute
Trying to cope with self-infliction
Drinking 'til I'm incoherent
Do-o-o-own
