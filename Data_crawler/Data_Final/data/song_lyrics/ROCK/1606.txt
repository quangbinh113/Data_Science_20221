Song Name: I Love You
Oh, When I look in your eyes, I see words I can't describe
And these words I'm tellin' you and I tell you, "I love you"
Aah, don't try to put me down
Aah, just because my back is turned around
I'm playing it straight for once
'Cause baby I love you
(Aah)
I really do
(Aah)
There's no one else like you
(Aah)
Baby I love, baby I love you
No matter what you do
Baby I love you and I tell you, "I love you"
Aah don't try to put me down
Just because my back is turned around
I'm playing it straight for once
'Cause baby I love you
(Aah)
I really do
(Aah)
There's no one else like you
(Aah)
Baby I love, aoh
Baby I love you
Oh yeah
'Cause baby I love you
(Aah)
I really do
(Aah)
There's no one like you
Baby I love you, baby I love you
(Aah)
Baby I love you, baby I love you
(Aah)
Baby I love you, baby I love
(Aah)
Baby I love you, no matter what I do
Baby I love you and I tell you, "I love you"
