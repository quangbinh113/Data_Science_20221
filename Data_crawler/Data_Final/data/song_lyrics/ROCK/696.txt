Song Name: Travelin' Band
737 comin' out of the sky
Oh, won't you take me down to Memphis
On a midnight ride?
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh, well
Come on, come on
Won't you get me to my room?
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Listen to the radio
Talkin' 'bout the last show
Someone got excited
Had to call the state militia
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh, wow
Here we come again on a Saturday night
Oh, with your fussin' and your fightin'
Won't you get me to the ride?
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh, wow
Oh, I'm playin' in a travelin' band
Playin' in a travelin' band
Won't you get me, take my hand?
Well, I'm playin' in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh, wow
Hey
