Song Name: Spanish Castle Magic
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there
If we travel by my... Dragonfly
No it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right
Hey
Hang on my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of a Spanish castle magic
The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out
Hang on my darling yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish castle magic
Yeah baby
Hang on my darling yeah
Hang on, hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish castle magic
Hey
A little bit of Spanish castle magic
Its all in your mind
A little bit of daydream here and there
