Song Name: Fingernails
I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one by one by one
I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one by one by one
God as my witness, no more compromise
I'm in the fight of my life
I've picked up the language and speaking it nice
I'm in the fight of my life
They taught me vicious, so they recognise
I'm in the fight for my life
Blood on your hands, and now blood covers mine
Having the time of my life with your fingernails
One by one by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails
One by onе by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails
Out hеre promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next, out here
One by one by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails one by one
Violence is history, and history has rhymed
We got the fight of our lives
Sign the petitions so peaceful, so quiet
We got the fight of our lives
I won't be no victim, won't be no messiah
I'm in the fight for my life
The days meant for love and the days meant for ire
I had the time of my life
I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one
Pulling off your fingernails one by one
By one by one by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails
One by one by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails
Out here promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next, out here
One by one by one by one
Pulling off your fingernails one by one
Why you wasted?
Why you wasted?
Why you wasted?
Why you wasted?
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
One by one by one by one
Out here promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next, out here
Pulling off your fingernails one by one by one by one
