Song Name: One Night (Second 'Sit-Down' Show) - Live
No strap for you
Is what I'm not looking for.
The things I did and I saw,
Would make the dreamer...
Dreamer...
Where is the strap?
Oh it feels good
Let me find my hands
And I know, baby I know
It's been too long
I said too long
You're on my mind
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Always lived very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that my life
Has being too lonely, too long
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make time stand still
Always lived very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I've lived very quiet life
Is being too lonely, too long
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
