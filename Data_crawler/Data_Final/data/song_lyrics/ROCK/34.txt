Song Name: Let You Down (feat. Charlotte Sands)
I'm not gonna let you down
I'm not gonna let you fade away another day
Don't run away, run away, run!
I would never turn my back on you
For you, I'd always be true and
I know that you've been hurt before and
You hide your face with your disguise
'Cause someone filled your head with lies
But you don't have to worry this time
No, you don't have to worry
'Cause I would never let you down
I will never let you fade away another day
Don't run away, run away
'Cause I will never let you drown
Don't fade away, let it out and let me in
Don't run away, run away, run!
You don't see what I see when you look at yourself
Wish you were someone else
I can see the pain behind those eyes
Don't get caught up in the lies
And don't tell me that this isn't real
I've never felt the way you make me feel
So I'm not letting you go
No, I'm not letting you go!
'Cause I would never let you down
I will never let you fade away another day
Don't run away, run away
'Cause I will never let you drown
Don't fade away, let it out and let me in
Don't run away, run away, run!
You hide your face with your disguise
'Cause someone filled your head with lies
They better pray they never meet me
And if they do, they better run!
Do you wish you were somebody else?
Do you wish you were somebody else?
Don't believe those lies
Don't believe those lies
Don't believe those lies
You don't have to worry
'Cause I would never let you down
I will never let you fade away another day
Don't run away, don't run away
'Cause I will never let you drown
Don't fade away, let it out and let me in
Don't run away, run away, run!
(Oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
