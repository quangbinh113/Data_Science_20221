Song Name: What Do You Do for Money Honey
You're working in bars, riding in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view on the finest avenue
Looking at your beat on the street
You're always pushing, shoving, satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be getting old
So stop your love on the road
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes, I wonder, I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Where you get your kicks?
You're loving on the take, and you're always on the make
Squeezing all the blood out of men
Yeah, we're standing in a queue, just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin', trying to get it back in
But girl, you must be getting slow
So stop your love on the road
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes, I wonder, yes, I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Yeah, what do you do for money, honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money, honey?
How you get your licks?
Go
Yow! Honey, what do you do for money?
I said, Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh honey (honey)
Oh yeah, honey, what do you do for money?
What you gonna do?
Hey now, honey (oh yea, honey), what do you do for money?
What you gonna do?
Oww, what you gonna do?
