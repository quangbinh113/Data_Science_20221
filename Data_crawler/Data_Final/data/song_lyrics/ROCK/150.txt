Song Name: Spillways
Through benediction
You tried to rid your mind of malediction
But through all this time
You try to peel it off, and it is such a ride
Your desolation led you into this
Vile incarnation of consummated bliss
I know you need it now to make you feel alive

All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
And I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
It is the cruel beast that you feed
It is your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
You keep a casket buried deep within
You try to mask it, but fall back in sin
You want to shake it off, but you are stuck inside
When stripped of rags of skin and spine
Human decay, Corpus dei
Terminally dispelled
And it is such a ride
All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
And I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Spillways, spillways
It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
