Song Name: You've Got To Hide Your Love Away - Remastered 2009
Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ryday
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she said to me
Love will find a way
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
