Song Name: Happy
Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
Always burned a hole in my pants
Never made the school mama happy
Never blew a second chance, oh no
I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Always took candy from strangers
Didn't wanna get me no trade
Never wanna be like papa
Workin' for the boss every night and day
I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love, baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, please keep me
I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby
Never got a flash out of cocktails
When I got some flesh off the bone
Never got a lift out of Learjet
When I can fly way back home
I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby
Happy
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Baby, won't ya keep me happy?
Oh, keep on dancin', keep me happy
Now baby, won't you squeeze it? (Happy)
Oh babe, you got to feel it (happy)
Now, now, now, now, now keep me happy
Come on now, keep me happy
Keep on dancin', keep me happy
Keep on dancin', keep me happy
Come on babe, keep me happy
