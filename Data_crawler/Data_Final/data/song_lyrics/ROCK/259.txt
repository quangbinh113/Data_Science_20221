Song Name: Mine
I will wear you down
I will break your crown because it's mine
Mine, all mine
I will scream your name
I'll make your body shake because it's mine
Mine, all mine
And I will take your fears (I will take your fears)
And make them disappear (and make them disappear)
But let me make it clear that I
I will break your heart
I will make you cry
I'll take you apart
Because you're mine
Like a brand-new toy
I'll destroy in time
Leave you in pieces, boy
Because you're mine
Mine, all mine
I will be your star
I will make it hard
Because it's mine
Mine, all mine
I will kiss and scratch and bite
I'll turn up the night
Because it's mine
Mine, all mine
And I will let you win (I will let you win)
But I can't let you win (I can't let you win)
And I won't let you forget that I
I will break your heart
I will make you cry
I'll take you apart
Because you're mine
Like a brand-new toy
I'll destroy in time
Leave you in pieces boy
Because you're mine
Mine all mine
I will love you so
I will make you whole, because you're mine
Mine, all mine
I will make you stay
Just to throw you away, because you're mine
Because you're mine
Break your heart, make you cry, take you apart, because you're mine
I will break your heart
I will make you cry
I'll take you apart
Because you're mine
Like a brand-new toy
I'll destroy in time
Leave you in pieces, boy
Because you're mine
Mine, all mine
