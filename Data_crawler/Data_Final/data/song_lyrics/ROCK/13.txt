Song Name: Supernatural
One last time
Let you back into my head
Yeah, black-black black and blue beat-up
High off everything you said
Oh, Chelsea morning
With the devil in my eyes
Where it's not so bad
I can't be mad
At white, white lies
If you want me, let me know
You flip me like a domino
Got ya hands all over my body
But you're actin' like you don't want me
Yeah, if you want me, let me know
You're terrifin' beautiful
Like a thunderbolt through my body
It's enough to make me feel supernatural
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, baby, I feel supernatural
Oh, what a shame
Your spirit never left
Possessed me like a demon
Made them worship at your bed
Oh, yeah
I must be outta my mind
Any cause to watch you cry
Is just one last line
If you want me let me know
You flip me like a domino
Got ya hands all over my body
But you're actin' like you don't want me
Yeah, if you want me let me know
You're terrifin' beautiful
Like a thunderbolt through my body
It's enough to make me feel supernatural
Supernatural
I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah, baby, I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural
Supernatural
I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah, baby, I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural
I do believe (I do believe)
That's the old me (that's the old me)
I'd never leave (I'm gonna be)
Yeah
I do believe (I do believe)
That's the old me (that's the old me)
I'd never leave (I'm gonna be)
Hey...
Supernatural
I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah, baby, I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural
Supernatural
I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable
I'm supernatural
