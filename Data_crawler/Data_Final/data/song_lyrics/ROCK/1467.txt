Song Name: With A Little Help From My Friends - Remastered 2009
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on you're own)
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
(Do you need anybody)
I need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody)
I want somebody to love
(Would you believe in a love at first sight)
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
(What do you see when you turn out the lights)
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
(Do you need anybody)
I just need someone to love
(Could it be anybody)
I want somebody to love
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
