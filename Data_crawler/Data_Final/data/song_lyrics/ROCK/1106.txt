Song Name: When You Know (Where You Come From)
With your head up in the clouds
You try to win the race
You're the leader of the pack
Always
The candle keeps burning from both ends
Until it's blowing out with a bang
When you think you know the game
You don't know anything at all
You cross the red line once again
Free fall
Hope you've learned your lesson well my friend
'Cause there will always be a second chance
When you know where you come from
You know where you're going
Just because you're a child of your time
When you know where you come from
You back down for no one
Just be true to yourself, it's your life
With your head up in the clouds
Your angels by your side
Someone up there keeps your dreams
Alive
The candle keeps burning from both ends
And the road calls your name once again
When you know where you come from
You know where you're going
Just because you're a child of your time
When you know where you come from
You back down for no one
Just be true to yourself, it's your life
Just be true to yourself, it's your life
And you keep driving down the highway of your life
There is no exit sign at all
There is a warning light that's flashing all the time
And only you can stop your downfall
When you know where you come from
You know where you're going
Just because you're a child of your time
When you know where you come from
You back down for no one
Just be true to yourself, it's your life
Just be true to yourself, it's your life
Just be true to yourself, it's your life...
