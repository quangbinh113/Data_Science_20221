Song Name: What Would You Do? [Feat. Gavin Rossdale]
Gotta find a better way to quit the cigarettes
Gotta drink another drink until I can forget
Gotta find a way to feel like I'm myself, whoa
(Well, this erodes my body, erodes my body) with the whiskey came the things that I do regret
(Erodes my body, breaks my body down) and I know there were things I should not have said
I believe you've already got them written down, whoa
When the world around me can feel so rotten
I am sorry for making you feel so low
Never gonna lose these feelings I regret
Always gonna be the same old tired shit
What would you do?
What would you do?
There will never be a feeling, I suspect
All apologies are something heaven-sent
What would you do?
What would you do?
I lie awake at night, I'm trying not to break a sweat
Mind is racing, there's no comfort for me yet
Gotta find a way to get away from myself, oh
(Well, this erodes my body, erodes my body) I really wish I could erase all the things I did
(Erodes my body, breaks my body down) I really wish I had a path to recompense
I really wish I had a way to cleanse myself, oh
When the world around me can feel so rotten
I am sorry for making you feel so low
Never gonna lose these feelings I regret
Always gonna be the same old tired shit
What would you do?
What would you do?
There will never be a feeling, I suspect
All apologies are something heaven-sent
What would you do?
What would you do?
Never gonna lose these feelings I regret
Always gonna be the same old tired shit
What would you do?
What would you do?
There will never be a feeling, I suspect
All apologies are something heaven-sent
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
