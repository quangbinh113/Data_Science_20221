Song Name: Livin' On The Edge Of The Night
You went off the river
Smoke stacks fade to blind
This town's my own, ridin'free and alone
And I'm looking back
Maybe I know some people
Maybe I break some rules
But this is the street, I've got to compete
Baby, I ain't no fool
So I take a little bad with the good
It ain't just black and white
(It still ain't black and white)
You've got to deal with the real
Woo, living on the edge of the night
Every wild desire
Beckons from the dark
I've made my bed but I can't risk my head
While I still swim with sharks
Everyone needs something
Sometimes they don't know why
But so much good's been misunderstood
In the blink of the eye
So I take a little bad with the good
It ain't just black and white
(It still ain't black and white)
You've got to deal with the real
Woo, living on the edge of the night
You say that you don't like it
Or maybe it's just my life
So you live yours and I'll keep mine
Rolling like a wheel through the city
Living on the edge of the night
And when the black rain's down
In this cold gray town
I'll be waiting
Waiting at the edge of the night
Woo, living on the edge of the night
Woo, living on the edge of the night
