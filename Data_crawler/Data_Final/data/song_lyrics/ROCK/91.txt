Song Name: Hurts Like Hell
I've got a fucked up complex
I want what makes me damaged
Deeper I fall in this cycle
I just can't deny
I must be outta my mind, 'cause when you dig in the knife
I kinda like it, like it when it hurts like hell
You cut me right to the bone, I'm feeling out of control
You know I like it, like it when it hurts like hell
If I could break the habit, then I could kill the addict inside
But I still like it, like it when it hurts like hell
How did you get so toxic? (Whoa-whoa)
Am I a sick psychotic? (Whoa whoa)
The deeper I fall in this cycle
I still can't deny
I must be outta my mind, 'cause when you dig in the knife
I kinda I like it, like it when it hurts like hell
You cut me right to the bone, I'm feeling out of control
You know I like it, like it when it hurts like hell
If I could break the habit, then I could kill the addict inside
But I still like it, like it when it hurts like hell
Something's gotta give
Wish I could hate you, wish I could hate you
I can't keep going on like this
Wish I could hate you, break you, quit you
Wish I could hate you
I must be outta my mind, 'cause when you dig in the knife
I kinda I like it, like it when it hurts like hell
You cut me right to the bone, I'm feeling out of control
You know I like it, like it when it hurts like hell
If I could break the habit, then I could kill the addict inside
But I still like it, like it when it hurts like hell
Like it when it hurts like hell
Like it when it hurts like
Like it when it hurts like hell
Like it when it, like it when it hurts like hell
