Song Name: Dead Flowers - 2009 Mix
1,2,3,4
Well, when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folk that you know
I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
Cause you know I could never be alone
Take me down little Susie take me down
Cause I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
You can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Well, when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on your Kentucky derby days
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
With another girl to take my pain away
Take me down little Susie take me down
Cause I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
Send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Take me down little Susie take me down
Cause I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
You can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
