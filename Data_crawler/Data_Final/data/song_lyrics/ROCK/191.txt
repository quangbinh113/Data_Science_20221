Song Name: Take Me Away
You got to get older yourself
I need a break from my brain
From the doubt, from the stress, from the pain
This anxiety is killing me and keeping me awake
I need a break from my temper
It's exhausting to live with the anger
It weighs me down and it holds me back
And it ties me to an anchor
Take me away
'Cause I'm not okay
I'm stuck at the bottom
In a prison of problems
That I can't escape
So take me away
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I need a break from my phone (yeah)
I'm jealous of these fuckers I don't even know (yeah)
Yeah, I never win and comparison is nothing but a black hole
Take me away (take me away)
'Cause I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I'm stuck at the bottom
In a prison of problems
That I can't escape
So take me away
Take me away in a car on a plane
This whole world keeps fucking with my brain
Take me away please give it a rest
I just need to take a break
From my brain
Take me away (take me away)
'Cause I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I'm stuck at the bottom
In a prison of problems
That I can't escape
So take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I need a break from my brain
