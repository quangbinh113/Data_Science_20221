Song Name: No One Like You
Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I've missed you since I've been away
Babe, wasn't easy to leave you alone
Getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice I would stay
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Ooh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine ya come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
