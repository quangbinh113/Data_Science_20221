Song Name: Ride On
It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle

Mmh and another empty bed

Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

Mmh, that's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) thumb in the air
(Ride on) one of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
'Til then I'll just keep riding on
Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord, I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?
(Ride on)
(Ride on) got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) goin' the wrong way
(Ride on)
(Ride on) gonna change my evil ways
(Ride on)
One of these days
One of these days
(Ride on)
(Ride on) I'm gonna
(Ride on)
(Ride on) mmh, lookin' for a truck
(Ride on) Mmh
(Ride on) keep on riding

Ridin' on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
(Ride on) have myself a good time
(Ride on) mmh, yeah
(Ride on) ride, ride, ride
(Ride on) one of these days
(Ride on) one of these days
