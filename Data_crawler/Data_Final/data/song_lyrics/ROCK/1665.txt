Song Name: Little Know It All
I'm the kid that no one knows
I live a life I never chose
With these thoughts in my mind
On my own, my own
I'm face to face with the unknown
My scary movie will be shown
I've got one you won't mind
Of my own, of my own
We take from one another
We never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side?
Well, nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you so blind?
Little know it all
Ten bucks in my hands
Little know it all
Don't cry I understand
I'm a target of the smart
They got ambition, I got heart
I'm analyzed and tagged
Before I start
So tell me who can I respect
I feel the leash around my neck
As I find out there's shame
In the game, in the game
We take from one another
And never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side?
Well, nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you so blind?
And I feel like
I'm caught outside the box
And I feel like
I'm sleeping when I'm not
We take from one another
And never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side?
Well, nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you so blind?
Little know it all
Ten bucks in my hands
Little know it all
Don't cry I understand
Little know it all
Ten bucks in my hands
Little know it all
Don't cry I understand
You'll never know it all
