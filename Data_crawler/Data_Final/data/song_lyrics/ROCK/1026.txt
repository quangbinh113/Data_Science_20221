Song Name: Not For The Innocent - Demo
I'm mean and I'm dirty like none you've ever seen
Bad habits drip like honey, no tongue can lick me clean
I'm not of royal blood, I've never been discreet
Better lock up your daughters
We're comin' to your town
We're here for the slaughter
Kick you when you're down
Kick you when you're down
We're not for the innocent
We're not for the innocent
Oh, we're not for the innocent
Let the beast run wild, yeah
I've been damned, I've been cursed, I've been guilty and abused
I spit the hangman in his face and hung him with his noose
Habitual threat, I got you in my claws
Gonna tan your hide
Rip the flesh off your bones
Look me in the eye
And you're gonna turn to stone
You're gonna turn to stone
We're not for the innocent
Oh, we're not for the innocent
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're not for the innocent
Let the beast run wild
Better lock up your daughters
We're comin' to your town
You better pray we're not around
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Let the beast run wild
Not for the innocent
Oh no, not for, not for the innocent
Yeah, not for the innocent
Let the beast run wild
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
