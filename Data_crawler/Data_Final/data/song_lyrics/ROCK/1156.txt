Song Name: Can't You Hear Me Knocking - 2009 Mix
Yeah, you got satin shoes
Yeah, you got plastic boots

Y'all got cocaine eyes
Yeah, you got speed freak jive, jive
Can't you hear me knockin'?
On your window
Can't you hear me knockin'?
On your door, oh oh
Can't you hear me knockin'?
Down your dirty street
Yeah
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Can't you hear me knockin'?
Ahh, are you safe asleep?
Can't you hear me knockin'?
Yeah, down the gas light street, now
Can't you hear me knockin'?
Yeah, throw me down the keys
Alright now

Hear me ringin' big bell tolls
Hear me singin' soft and low
I've been beggin' on my knees
I've been kickin', help me please
Hear me prowlin'
I'm gonna take you down
Hear me growlin'
Yeah, I've got fatter feet now, now, now, now
Hear me howlin'
And all, all around your street now
Hear me knockin'
And all, all around your town
