Song Name: Inbetween Days
Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on, and disappear
Go on, go on away from here
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you
Without you
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back, come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
What can't you see?
Come back, come back
Come back to me
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
