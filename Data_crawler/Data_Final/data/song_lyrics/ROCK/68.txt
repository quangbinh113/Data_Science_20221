Song Name: Make Believe
It's not the same as it used to be
And I'm afraid it's pointing back at me
I have to question what I still believe
I just hope I find the missing piece
Feels like every day's the same
Chemicals inside my brain
Make me think I'm in a simulation
Nothing ever seems to change
And it's written on my face
Am I living in my own creation?
Am I alive or am I just breathing?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I've been lost, looking for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losing hope
Is this all a dream?
Tell me, is it make-believe?
I'm not the same as I used to be
I think I'm haunted by the things I've seen
Is anybody else the same as me?
(Is anybody else the same as me?)
Feels like every day's the same
Chemicals inside my brain
Make me think I'm in a simulation
Nothing ever seems to change
And it's written on my face
Am I headed for my own damnation?
Am I alive or am I just breathing?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I've been lost, looking for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losing hope
Is this all a dream?
Tell me, is it make-believe?
Am I glitching in and out again?
When the game is over, will I see the end?
Maybe they just forgot to plug me in
The screen is black, and now I'm seeing red
Now I'm seeing red
When the game is over, will I see the end?
Am I alive or am I just breathing?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I've been lost, looking for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losing hope
Is this all a dream?
Tell me, is it make-believe?
