Song Name: Come Together
Here come ol' flat top
He come grooving up slowly
He got juju eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together, right now, over me
He bag production
He got walrus gumboot
He got Ono side board
He won spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair
You can feel his disease
Come together, right now, over me
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He won mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good-looking
'Cause he so hard to see
Come together, right now, over me
Come together, ooh!
Come together
Come together
Come together
Come together
Yeah
