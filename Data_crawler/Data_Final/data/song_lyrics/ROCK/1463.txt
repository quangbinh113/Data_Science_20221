Song Name: Eminence Front
The sun shines
People forget

The spray flies as the speedboat glides
People forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
People forget

The snow packs as the skier tracks
People forget
Forget they're hiding
Behind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put-on

It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put-on
An eminence front
Eminence front, put-on
Eminence front
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put-on
It's a put-on
It's a put-on
It's a put-on

Come and join the party
Dress to kill
Won't you come and join the party
Dress to kill
Dress to kill
The drinks flow
People forget

That big wheel spins, the hair thins
People forget
Forget they're hiding
The news slows
People forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they're hiding
Behind an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put-on
It's just an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put-on
An eminence front
An eminence front, put-on
Eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put-on
It's a put-on
It's a put-on
It's a put-on
Come and join the party
Dress to
Come and join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come and join the party
Dress to kill
Dress yourself to kill
