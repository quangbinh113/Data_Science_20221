Song Name: Fashion - 2017 Remaster
There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there
But we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Oh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk
But it's not very clear, oh, bop
That people from good homes
Are talking this year, oh, bop, fashion
It's loud and it's tasteless
I've not heard it before, oh, bop
You shout it while you're dancing
On the dance floor, oh, bop, fashion
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion
Fashion

We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No
Beep-beep, beep beep
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion, la-la-la-la la la la la la
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion, la-la-la-la la la la la
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion, la-la la la la la la

Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion
Oh, bop, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Fa fa fa fa fashion, la-la-la-la la la la la la
