Song Name: I'll Remember You
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely, oh, so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember you
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday, I'll return to stay
'Til then I will remember too
Every bright star we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Ooh, you'll remember too
(I'll remember you)
I'll remember you
