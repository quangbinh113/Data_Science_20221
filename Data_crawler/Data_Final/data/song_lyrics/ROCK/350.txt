Song Name: Your Love
Oh hey
Look at me
Seems Like I got everything
I know you hate me, The look in your eyes
Too bad you'll never be mine
I see you on the sidelines
You're busy with the white lines
I'm watching with my wide eyes
Oh yeah, I
Oh I need your love
Found out what you're made of
Turns out your mine I know
Your love I stole and own
Maybe I'm just vain
You'll say I'm insane
But really, you're great
Knowing I'm in pain
I know one day
You'll see it my way
You're so far away
Oh yeah, I
Oh, I need your love
Found out what you're made of
Turns out Your mine I know
Your love I stole and own
Your love I stole and own
Your love I stole and own
Ooh, I
Ooh, I
Ooh, I
Ooh, I
