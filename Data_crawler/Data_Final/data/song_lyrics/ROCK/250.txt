Song Name: Blessed Are the Meek - Remastered
You know the story about a woman and a man
In a garden living free
The only danger was a stranger by a tree
Selling apples by the score
Blessed are the meek, blessed are the true lovers
It's anybody's guess really more or less
Where it's gonna go
Better make a break before we get in big trouble
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
The way it's gotta be
Another story about a woman and a man
The only difference is the time
He had a lover, she knew his long hair was his strength
So he lost it all for love
Blessed are the meek, blessed are the true lovers
It's anybody's guess really more or less
Where it's gonna go
Better make a break before we get in big trouble
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
The way it's gotta be
Gotta do something seriously
Oh oh oh can't ignore it any longer
Oh no no, oh no
Another story about a woman and a man
Who can say it's right or wrong?
He was the new king in the making, but he said
Gonna give it up for love
Blessed are the meek, blessed are the true lovers
It's anybody's guess really more or less
Where it's gonna go
Better make a break before we get in big trouble
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
The way it's gotta be
Blessed are the meek, blessed are the true lovers
It's anybody's guess really more or less
Where it's gonna go
