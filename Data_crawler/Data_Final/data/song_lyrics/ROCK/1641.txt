Song Name: Complete Control
They said release 'Remote Control'
But we didn't want it on the label
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"
The people laughed, but the press went mad
Ohh, oh, ohh, someone's really smart
Ohh, oh, ohh, complete control, that's a laugh
On the last tour, my mates they couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
At every hotel, we was met by the law
Come for the party, come to make sure
Ohh, oh, ohh, have we done something wrong?
Ohh, oh, ohh, complete control, even over this song
You're my guitar hero!
They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant let's make a lotsa money
And worry about it later
Ohh, oh, ohh, I'll never understand
Ohh, oh, ohh, complete control, let me see your other hand
I don't trust you, why should you trust me?
â€”Huh?
All over news, spread fast
They're dirty, they're filthy
They ain't a gonna last
(Total) This is Joe Public speaking
(C-O-N, Control)
I'm controlled in the body
I'm controlled in the mind
(Total) This is punk rockers
(C-O-N, Control)
We're controlled in the price
Of the hard drugs we must have to find
Total C-O-N, Control
Total (Parent! Control!)
C-O-N, Control
We've gotta?
(C-O-N, Control)
That means you
I kick it, I fight it, I gotta get up at it
(C-O-N, Control)
I gotta kick it
