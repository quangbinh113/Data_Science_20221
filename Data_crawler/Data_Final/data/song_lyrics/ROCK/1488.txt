Song Name: 1921
Got a feeling '21
Is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
So you think '21
Is gonna be a good year
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no never
I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You won't say nothing to no one
Never in your life
You never heard it
How absurd it all seems
Without any proof
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it, not a word of it
You won't say nothing to no one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the truth
Got a feeling '21
Is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
Got a feeling '21
Is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy?
