Song Name: Heat Wave - Mono Version
Heat wave
Heat wave
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's
Filled with fire
Could be that I'm
Very sentimental
Or is this just the
Way love's supposed
To be?
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
Can't explain
I feel, yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood
Pressure's got a
Hold on me
'Cause this is the
Way love's supposed
To be
()
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave
