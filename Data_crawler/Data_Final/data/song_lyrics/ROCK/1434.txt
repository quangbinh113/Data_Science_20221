Song Name: You're Lost Little Girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you?
Think that you know what to do
Impossible? Yes, but it's true
I think that you know what to do, yeah
Sure that you know what to do
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you?
Think that you know what to do
Impossible? Yes, but it's true
I think that you know what to do, girl
Sure that you know what to do
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
