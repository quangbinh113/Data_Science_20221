Song Name: ur a <stranger>
The least you could do is find someone else
The least you could do, ooh
I know the least you could do is find someone else
The least you could do, ooh
She used to be mine, now she's yours and that's fine
Guess I ran out of time to please
I never thought I'd be angry, you're so fucking shady
I gave you your lady, such a shame you'd forget
Me, me
Me, me
The least you could do is find someone else
The least you could do, ooh
I know the least you could do is find someone else
The least you could do, ooh
I can't see you
Oh, I don't fucking need to
You think you're so good together?
Oh, my God, yeah, me too
You're a stranger, when I see you, I don't speak
See you, I can't breathe
You're a stranger, when I see you, I don't speak
See you, I can't breathe
Breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't breathe
