Song Name: Charlotte Sometimes - Single 10/81
All the faces, all the voices blur
Change to one face, change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed
The light seems bright and glares on white walls
All the sounds of Charlotte, sometimes

Into the night with Charlotte, sometimes
Night after night, she lay alone in bed
Her eyes so open to the dark
Streets all looked so strange, they seemed so far away
Charlotte did not cry
People seemed so close
Playing expressionless games
People seemed so close
So many other names
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Expressionless the trance
Sometimes I'm dreaming
So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes
On a different world
Come to me
Scared princess
Charlotte sometimes
On that bleak track, see the sun is gone again
The tears were pouring down her face
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before
Sometimes I dream
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
So many different names
Sometimes I dream
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte, sometimes crying for herself
Charlotte, sometimes dreams a wall around herself
But it's always with love
With so much love it looks like
Everything else
Charlotte sometimes
So far away, glass sealed and pretty
Charlotte sometimes
