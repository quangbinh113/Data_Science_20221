Song Name: Never Going Back Again - 2004 Remaster
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
Mmh
Mmh
You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again
Been down one time
Been down two times
Mmh, I'm never going back again
Mmh
