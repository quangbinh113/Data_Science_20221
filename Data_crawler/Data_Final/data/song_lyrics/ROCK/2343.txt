Song Name: Elevation
Yeah, yeah
High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips, eclipse
You elevate my soul
I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
A star, lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you can educate my mind
Explain all these controls
Can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
Love
Lift me up out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true?
I believe in you
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
