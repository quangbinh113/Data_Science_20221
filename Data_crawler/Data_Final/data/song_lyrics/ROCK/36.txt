Song Name: FUCK ABOUT IT (feat. blackbear)
I like you but I need some space
I like you kinda far away
It's not hard to kill a day
Looking at your face
I like you but I need some room
Been giving me your attitude
It doesn't always stay that way
I hate the aftertaste
I don't wanna leave you hanging on
But when we fight, it's like a marathon
Give me three days, three days alone, yeah
We can fuck about it later, if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong, 'cause you
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later
We can fuck about it later, if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we got, baby
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
You've been at my crib for like seventh day up in a row
You've been doing silly things like checking who I follow
I know you're waiting by the phone
But I just wanna be all alone, tonight
And it's all right, I won't lie, to you
But sometimes, when we fight
It's like scars on my wrist
When I think about the shit that we did to one another, baby
We can fuck about it later, if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong, 'cause you
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
We can fuck about it later, if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we got, baby
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
I don't wanna leave you hanging on
But it's kinda hard to miss who's never gone
Give me three days, three days alone, yeah
We can fuck about it later, if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong, 'cause you
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later (yeah)
We can fuck about it later, if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we got, baby
You don't seem like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
We can fuck about it later, if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong, 'cause you
You don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later
