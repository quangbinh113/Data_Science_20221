Song Name: SAY
"Go on and
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree with me
You're shining like a gaslighter
Nobody lights up a room like ya
You light my fuse
Like someone's gonna lose
Like I lost a couple' screws in your
Fire
You treat me like I'm made of plastic
One day I might snap like an elastic
This lowbrow cash cow
Never had the know-how
Might as well just quit now
"Go on and
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree with me"
You said, "hurry 'coz you're use-by-dated
And your image is far too complicated
Just be one thing
Little puppet on a string
Just shut your mouth and sing
Just shut your mouth and -
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree with me"
Crack me like a pinata
Just hit me harder
To get what you, to get what you want
Crack me like a pinata
Just hit me harder
To get what you, to get what you want
And it's the same old boring story
A million in his-story
These big bloodsuckers
Abusing power for glory
They're just getting way more stealthy now...
So shutup, shutup, shutup...
"Go on and
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree
Say what you wanna
Say what you wanna
Say
As long as you agree with me"
Crack me like a pinata
Just hit me harder
To get what you, to get what you want
Crack me like a pinata
Just hit me harder
To get what you, to get what you want
