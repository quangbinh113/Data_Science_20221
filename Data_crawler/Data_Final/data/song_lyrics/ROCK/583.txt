Song Name: Close My Eyes Forever
Baby, I get so scared inside
And I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind
Or is it fantasy?
Heaven, is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do
With a childhood tragedy?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same?
Sometimes, it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my veins
And when we sleep would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same?
Will you ever take me?
No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?
No I'll never feel the same
(Oh)
I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same?
(Oh yeah)
Close your eyes, close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me
