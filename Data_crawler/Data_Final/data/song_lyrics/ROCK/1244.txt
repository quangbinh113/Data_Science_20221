Song Name: Fat Bottomed Girls - 2011 Remaster
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Aah, down beside that red fire light
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Hey!
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey!
I've been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
C'mon
Oh, won't you take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red fire light
Oh, and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Hey, listen here
Now I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality, I tell you
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman, you done made a big man out of me
Now get this
Are (I know) you gonna take me home tonight? (Please)
Oh, down beside that red fire light
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round (yeah)
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Get on your bikes and ride
Oh yeah, oh yeah, them fat bottomed girls
Fat bottomed girls
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, ride 'em cowboy
Fat bottomed girls
Yes, yes
