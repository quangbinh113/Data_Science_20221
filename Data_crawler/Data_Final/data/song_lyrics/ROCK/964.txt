Song Name: Waitin' for the Bus - 2006 Remaster
Have mercy
Been waitin' for the bus all day
Have mercy
Been waitin' for the bus all day
I got my brown paper bag and my take-home pay
Have mercy
Old bus be packed up tight
Have mercy
Old bus be packed up tight
Well, I'm glad just to get on and home tonight
Right on
That bus done got me back
Right on
That bus done got me back
Well, I'll be ridin' on the bus till I Cadillac
