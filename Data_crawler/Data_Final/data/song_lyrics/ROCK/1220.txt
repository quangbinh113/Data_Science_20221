Song Name: Let It Bleed
Well we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well you can lean on me
Yeah we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well you can lean on me
She said my breasts they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy
Yeah we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah we all need someone we can cream on
Yeah and if you want to, well you can cream on me
I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse
Oh what pleasant company, ha
'Cause we all need someone we can feed on
Yeah and if you want it, well you can feed on me, hey
Take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby don't you take my head
Woo
Yeah we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah and if you want it baby, well you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, yeah, and if you want it, baby
Why don't ya bleed on me
All over, woo
Yeah
(C'mon back)
Ah get it on rider, woo
Get it on rider, get it on rider
You can bleed all over me, yeah
Get it on rider, woo
Get it on rider, yeah you can be my rider
You can cum all over me, ah
Get it on rider, babe
Get it on rider
Get it on rider, you can cum all over me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Yeah, c'mom, c'mon
Ah get it on rider
Baby cum all over me, yeah, yeah me
Get it on rider nah, nah, nah
Get it on rider, oh
