Song Name: Smile
I may not smile as you turn and walk away
My heart just falls on every words you say
I will not fight
'Cause you will not listen
And no, I never led my troops to war, oh-ooh
And no, I never learned what my life was for, oh-ooh
And all I ever got was nothing
'Cause you always said "One day"
You always said, "Soon I'll do it"
You always said "Now" but waited
Now you've waited to long, waited to long
I thought you was right
'Cause I knew I was wrong
Now you can cry if you want, cry if you want
I will hang in myself, myself, myself
I will return as a brilliant shining light
The things I've said will all be proven right
One failure one night
And your whole life's wasted
And no, you never led your troops to war, oh-ooh
And no, you never learned what your life was for, oh-ooh
And all I ever gave you was nothing
'Cause I always said "One day"
I always said "Soon I'll do it"
I always said "Now" but you waited
Now you've waited to long, waited to long
Thought I was weak but proved I was strong
Now you can cry if you want it, cry if you want
You can hang in yourself, yourself, yourself
You can cry if you want
I could cry if I want
We can cry if we want, want
Let's stop hanging ourselves
