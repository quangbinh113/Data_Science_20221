Song Name: Born to Touch Your Feelings - Studio Edit
I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
Close your eyes and I'll try to get in
Touch in your heart like the spring
'Cause I was born to touch your feelings
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
It's the only way to feel alright
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
Just the only way to feel alright
You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's chime in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out, learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I touch your feelings
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
It's the only way to feel alright
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
Just the only way to feel alright
