Song Name: Shine A Light
Saw you stretched out in room ten o'nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh couldn't seem to get a line on you
My sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you
My-my sweet honey love
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
When you're drunk in the alley, baby with your clothes all torn
When your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Whoa I just seen so many flies on you
I just can't brush 'em off
The angels beating all their wings in time
Smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up now
Come on up now
Come on up now
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Yeah, make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Yeah, warm like the evening sun, ah-nah-nah yeah
Come on up now
Come on up now
Come on up now
Come on up now
(May the good Lord) Yeah, yeah, yeah (shine a light on you)
Ah my Lord, make every song you sing your favorite tune
Ah yeah, (May the good Lord) Yeah, yeah Lord, shine a light on you
My, my, my, my warm like the evening sun
My, my, my, my, my yeah, yeah-yeah
