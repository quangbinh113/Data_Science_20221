Song Name: Dani California
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna?
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I loved my baby to death
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota
Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast!
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
