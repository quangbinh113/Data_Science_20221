Song Name: Big City Nights - 2015 - Remaster
When the daylight
Is falling down
Into the night
And the sharks try
To cut a big piece
Out of life
It feels alright
To go out to catch
An outrageous thrill
But it's more like
Spinning wheels
Of fortune
Which never stand still
Big city,
Big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city,
Big city nights
When the sunlight
Is rising up
In my eyes
And the long night
Has left me back
At somebody's side
It feels alright
For a long sweet minute
Like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something
I can't find anymore
Big city,
Big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city,
Big city nights
Always yearning
Big city,
Big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city,
Big city nights
There is no dream
That you can't make true,
If you're looking for love
But there's no girl
Who's burning the ice
Away from my heart
Maybe tonight!
Big city,
Big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city,
Big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
