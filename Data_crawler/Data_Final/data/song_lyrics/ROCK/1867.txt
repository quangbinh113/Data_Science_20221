Song Name: Carol / Little Queenie (Live from Blueberry Hill)
Oh Carol, Carol, Carol, Carol
Oh Carol, don't let him steal it away
Gonna learn to dance if it takes me night and day
Climb into my machine so we can cruise out
I know a swingin' little joint where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride
Park your car out in the open, then walk inside
A little cute girl takes your hat and you thank her, ma'am
Every time you make the scene, the joint is jammed
Oh Carol
Carol, Carol, Carol, oh Carol
Don't let him steal it away
Gonna learn to dance if it takes me night and day
Now if you want to hear some music like the Johnny Goode play
Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let the base carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you, the guitar too loud
Don't the music intrigue you when the drummer get proud?
Y'all can't dance, I know you wish you could
Stuck at the drummer, make 'em feel good
Oh Carol, Carol, Carol, Carol, oh Carol
Don't let him steal it away
Gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I oughta take it
If she can dance, we can make it
C'mon queenie, let's shake it
I said go, go, go, little queenie
Everybody say "go", little queenie
Everybody say "go", I say, little queenie
One more time, now everybody, little queenie
I say, little queenie
I say, queenie
Tell me who's the girl standin' over by the record machine
Looking like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile, I was still thinking
If it's a slow song, let's omit it
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it
And if it's good, y'all gonna admit it
Well, c'mon then, let's get with it
I say, little queenie
I say (go, go, go), little queenie
I say (go, go, go), little queenie
