Song Name: Sacred Kiss
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
Yeah, oh
Oh
It's a crime, forever shifting blame
I won't even bother to explain
First class one season then cut by the glass
Pointing fingers as we fight for the scratch
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
It's not an issue if you just trust yourself
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
So you be careful, you might just fuck yourself
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
Second chances just don't feel the same
Don't tell me that this is a fair game
Severed sincerely, I no longer ask
Rising fevers as the drip slides right back
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
Yeah
Force-fed, shut down, grasping at straws
Bloodshed for crowns, the devil's law
Something's got to give
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to tell
We're paralyzed by the sacred kiss
It's no surprise, it's a one-way trip, yeah
Too many lies, something's gotta give
We love the secrets that we just hate to (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) that we just hate to
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
