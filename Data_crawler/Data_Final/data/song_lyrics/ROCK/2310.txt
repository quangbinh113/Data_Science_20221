Song Name: The Caterpillar
Flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowin' and fillin' up my hopeless heart
Oh never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stall is the day you change
And fly away from me
You flicker and you're beautiful
You glow inside my head
You hold me hypnotized, I'm mesmerized
Your flames are flames that kiss me dead
I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stall is the day you change
And fly away from me
Oh, flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowin' and fillin' up my hopeless heart
Oh never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stall is the day you change
Fly away, away from me
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
