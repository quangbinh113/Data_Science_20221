Song Name: dead inside
Three, four
Woo!
Woo!
There's a picture in my head, running through my brain
My heart's a burning shed, don't let me in, I'll never stay
These scars I cover up, I carry all this pain
Numb this broken world, I feel you in my veins
I'm already fakin' the words I say
I've already taken too much today
I'm in love with all the voices inside my head
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
Just another broken dream in my lonely bed
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
I'm so dead inside
Woo!
Woo!
There's a memory on my mind, it keeps on coming back
Made a promise to myself I wouldn't let it get this bad
Now I'm lying wide awake, sleepless in my bed
My heart's a frozen lake, there's ice inside my chest
I'm already fakin' the words I say
I've already taken too much today
I'm looking for love in an empty space
Every stranger that I meet
I swear to God, I see your fucking face (and it's a shame)
I'm in love with all the voices inside my head
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
Just another broken dream in my lonely bed
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
Even though I'm still alive, I feel dead inside
It's the fact that it's so wrong, but it feels so right
Why do I feel all alone when I'm by your side?
Even though I'm still alive, I feel dead inside
I'm so dead inside
Tell me how it's gonna be
When you don't know me at all
Remember how you used to feel
Now I wake up, stare at the wall
Tell me how it's gonna be
Better off if I'm not around
Six feet under the ground
Even though I'm still alive, I feel dead inside
The fact that it's so wrong, but it feels so right
Why do I feel all alone when I'm by your side?
Even though I'm still alive, I feel dead inside
I'm so dead inside
I'm so dead inside
I'm so dead inside
I'm so dead inside, yeah
I'm in love with all the voices inside my head
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
Another broken dream in my lonely bed
You're so beautiful inside, but inside I'm dead
I'm so dead inside
