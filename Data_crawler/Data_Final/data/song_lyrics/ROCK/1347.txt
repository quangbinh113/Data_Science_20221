Song Name: No Quarter - Remaster
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight

The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter, they hold no quarter
Walking side by side with death

The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through

To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter, they ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they ask no quarter
They give no quarter
