Song Name: Rain Parade
Can you feel it
From so far away
It's too dark you and you just wanna run away
Times of trouble
You're still right here
Be the storm, take back all your fear
All those feelings tearing up your heart - can you let it go?
All those hopes, all your dreams - can you say them out loud?
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Heart pounding
Time to leverage light
Through the cracks, time to fight
Big breath,
You're standing tall
Roaring right through the squall.
All that heart all that soul, ridin high, come along
All those fears beating in your heart, can you sing them out loud?
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Undefeated,
Hope wont make make a sound
Time to scream out loud
Undefeated,
Hope wont make make a sound
Time to scream out loud
All those feelings tearing up your heart - time to let it all go!
All those hopes, all your dreams - time to scream it out loud!
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
Come join the rain parade
