Song Name: Let The Music Do The Talking
Rock-a-bye baby if you wanna dance
Grab yourself a body and take a chance
Said one time around is all you get
I'm still dancin' so you lost your bet
I got a hardcore mama with a hot hoochie coo
Make my wheels start spinning like a formula two
Got one for the money, two for the show
Three for my honey and four to let you know that I
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking 'cause I can't wait
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Cheese cake maybe if I take another bite
I'm a real fat city I'm an aero delight
Threw out my pipe and my alkaline
Got a squeaky clean body and a dirty mind
I'm a real fine dancer, I'll be cuttin' the rug
Got a brand-new baby, she's my brand-new drug
I got one for the money two for the show
Three for my honey and four to let you know that I
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking ('cause I can't wait)
Let the music do the talking (I gotta get it)
Let the music do the talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
