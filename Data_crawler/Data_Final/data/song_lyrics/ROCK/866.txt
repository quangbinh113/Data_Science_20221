Song Name: Have a Drink on Me
Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass I'm pretty handy
I'm trying to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine
So join me for a drink boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the cheque
We'll get hell to pay
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Yeah
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
On me
Come on
Dizzy, drunk and fightin'
On tequila white lightnin'
My glass is getting shorter
On whiskey, ice and water
So come on and have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the cheque
We'll get hell to pay
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
On me
Get stoned
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Yeah
Have A Drink On Me
Come on
Oooh
Gonna roll around
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swing
Have another drink
Gonna drink it dry
Gonna get me high
Come on all the boys
Make a noise
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have A Drink On Me
Have a drink oooooooon me
