Song Name: War Inside of Me
Gotta let me go
(G-g-g-go now)
I'm rotting from your ghost
(G-g-g-go)
These dreams won't let me sleep
(Just let me sleep now)
You need to release
(Me)
I've suffered enough
Who really cares?
We've all let our demons through the door
I'll take this loss
Leave it with me
And i'll find a way to turn this into war
Turn this into war
I'm gonna lose my mind
(J-j-just stop it)
You're bleeding in my eyes
(You've got to go)
Go haunt another soul
(Just let me sleep now)
You need to release
(Me)
I've suffered enough
Who really cares?
We've all let our demons through the door
I'll take this loss
Leave it with me
And i'll find a way to turn this into war
I'll turn this into war
Inside of me, this war inside of me
Inside of me, this war inside of me
Inside of me, this war inside of me
I'm ready for this line to break
Inside of me, this war inside of me
Inside of me, this war inside of me
Inside of me, this war inside of me
I've suffered enough
Who really cares?
We all let our demons through the door
I'll take this loss
Leave it with me
And i'll find a way to turn this into war
I'll turn this into war
(Go turn this into war)
(War)
Inside me
Inside of me
(War)
Inside me
Inside of me
(Inside of me, this war inside of me)
(Inside of me, this war inside of me)
I've suffered enough
(Inside of me, this war inside of me)
And I'm willing to bleed for the war inside of me
