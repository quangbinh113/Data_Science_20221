Song Name: Roadhouse Blues
Keep your eyes on the road
Your hand upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road
Your hand upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the Roadhouse
Gonna have a real-
Good time
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse
They got some bungalows
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse
They got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll
All night long
Do it, Robbie, do it
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta thrill my soul, alright
Roll, roll, roll, roll, a-thrill my soul
You gotta beep a gunk a chucha
Honk konk konk kadanta
Each ya puna ney cha
Bap pa lula ni chao
Pao pati cha
Ni saong kong
Yeah, ride
Ashen lady
Ashen lady
Give up your vows
Give up your vows
Save our city
Save our city
Right now
Well, I woke up this mornin'
And I got myself a beer
Well, I woke up this mornin'
And I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain
And the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll
All night long
