Song Name: All We Need
If you could read my mind now
What do you think you would see?
You'd see my life in your hands now
You got a hold over me
I see it in your eyes 'cause they tell no lies
I guess it's part of the thrill
You're like a shooting star with a vacant heart
That's going in for the kill
We got a good thing going
So don't let it die
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) all we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) and to believe in the dream
Is all we need
This ain't no bedtime story
This one you'll never forget
You're like a night never ending
That I can't wait to regret
I can't control myself, don't want nobody else
Is this too good to be true?
You gotta dance just like there's no one watchin'
So come on, kick off your shoes
We got a good thing going
So don't let it die
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) all we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) and to believe in the dream
Is all we need
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) all we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) and to believe in the dream
Is all we need
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) all we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) and to believe in the dream
Is all we need
Oh, it's all we need
Yeah, it's all we need
It's all we need
Yeah, it's all we need
We got a good thing going
Oh, it's all we need
We got a good thing going
Yeah, it's all we need
We got a good thing going
So don't let it die
