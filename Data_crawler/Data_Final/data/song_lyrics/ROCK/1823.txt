Song Name: Shot Down in Flames
Ooooh!
Wow!
One, Two!
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me
I'm really burning up
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, Baby what's the going price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no!
Said, Baby, you're driving me crazy
Layed it out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said:
Toss off buddy she's mine, uh
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Hey you, Angus!, shoot me, shoot
That's nice, wow
Uh, oh oh, woooooh
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames, NO!
Shot! Shot down in flames uhh
Shot down in flames!
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't need the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ooooohhh
