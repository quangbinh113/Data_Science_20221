Song Name: Thousand Lifetimes
C'mon!
Sick of feeling right and feeling wrong
I've been in this place way too long
I've been down and I've been strong
Like, what the hell is going on?
It's getting harder, but I know I'll make it
And there's no code in my DNA to front or fake it
I got these clouds hovering and hangin'
And the darkness consumes me
(Oh-oh-oh)
How long will I stand and fight?
God knows that I paid the price of a thousand lifetimes
My soul, my blood
Ain't that enough?
God knows that I paid the price for a thousand lifetimes
I must confess I break from the stress
I tell my story, get it off my chest
Green light 'til I get it right
Ain't no stopping 'til I save my life
Harder to breathe, it's getting harder to see
A future in front of me
Suffocated and vindicated
Never a minute goes by that's justified
(Oh-oh-oh)
How long will I stand and fight?
God knows that I paid the price of a thousand lifetimes
My soul, my blood
Ain't that enough?
God knows that I paid the price for a thousand lifetimes
Give it my all
Even when I fall
Back against the wall
When push comes to shove then I'm not giving up
No, no
Dedicated to the overworked
Who put everything on the line for those they love until it hurts
Kept your head up when it got tough
Kept faith and love when the roads dem get rough
A thousand lives couldn't pay for-
The strength you gave or the energy you gave up
I haven't prayed in years
But I know you're there somewhere
How long will I stand and fight?
God knows that I paid the price of a thousand lifetimes
My soul, my blood
Ain't that enough?
God knows that I paid the price of a thousand lifetimes
Oh yeah, a thousand lifetimes
I paid the price of a thousand lifetimes
