Song Name: Say It (To My Face)
I'm a b- and my band is an industry plant
Least that's what it says on the internet
Think you know who I am, you say you're not a fan
But you got all my songs playing in your head
It's so obvious you really want my attention
Hope you're having fun
Still stuck in your mothers basement (still stuck)
Talk trash, but you're like a million miles away
I'm not for your entertainment (I'm not)
I just laugh 'cause you're never ever gonna
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (oh)
You're so irrelevant, almost didn't commit
Almost didn't write you a second verse
Really wish I could stay, gotta fly to LA
Play a show at the wiltern
It's so obvious you really need some attention
Hope you're having fun
Still stuck in your mothers basement (still stuck)
Talk trash, but you're like a million miles away
I'm not for your entertainment (I'm not)
I just laugh 'cause you're never ever gonna
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (oh)
I know, I know
That you really need your mom
Run home, run home
Go home
Still stuck in your mothers basement
Talk trash, but you're like a million miles away
I'm not for your entertainment
I just laugh 'cause you're never ever gonna
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Say it to my face (say it to my face)
Why can't you say it to my face? (say it to my face)
Say it to my face
Meet me at the altar sucks
Nailed it
That's a wrap, folks
