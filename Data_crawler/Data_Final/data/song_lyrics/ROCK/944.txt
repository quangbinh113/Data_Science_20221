Make a love like a man

Lookin' for a guy who's a real go-getter, yeah
Every guy grab a girl
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better, yeah
Everybody (you want it)
I'm the one (I got it)
I'm Mr. Fun (you need it)

And I've come for you, come on
Don't call me gigolo, don't call me Casanova
Just call me on the phone and, baby, come on over
When you need someone
When you need someone to
Make a love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am, yeah
Make a love like a man
Your kind of man

Every day, every night
Take her little heart 'til it beats like a hammer, yeah, oh
Come on, do it good, do it right
Crazy little girl gonna stutter 'n' stammer (stammer)
Oh, yeah
Don't call me gigolo, don't call me Casanova
Just call me on the phone and, baby, come on over
When you need someone
When you need someone to
Make a love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am, yeah
Make a love like a man
Your kind of man
That's what I am
Gimme something rock 'n' roll
Little bit of rock 'n' roll
Gotta be rock 'n' roll
Little bit of rock 'n' roll
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
Gotta get it on if you really wanna get her
Never, ever wait it's a little to late
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better (you want it)
Yeah, baby (I got it)
I know (you need it)
Oh, oh (come get it)
Oh, come on
Don't call me gigolo, don't call me Casanova
Just call me on the phone and, baby, come on over
When you need someone (when you need someone)
When you need someone to
