Song Name: Need Your Love So Bad
I need someone's hand
To lead me through the night
I need someone's arms
To hold and squeeze me tight
And when the night begins
I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad
I need some lips, to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up
And tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low
And it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you give it up?
And bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby
So it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me
And stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I, I need your love so bad
I need a soft voice
To a talk to me at night
I don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make
Everything allright
Listen to my plea, baby
Bring it to me
Because I need your love so bad
