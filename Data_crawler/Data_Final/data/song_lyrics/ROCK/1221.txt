Song Name: Like A Rolling Stone - Edit
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're
Bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
About having to be scrounging for your
Next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
You've went to the finest school all right,
Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced
In it
Nobody has ever taught you how to
Live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have
To get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery trend, but now you
Realize
That he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel

How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
And a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
