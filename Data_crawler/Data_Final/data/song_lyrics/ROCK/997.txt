Song Name: God Gave Rock 'N' Roll To You II
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone

Do you know what you want?
You don't know for sure
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're gettin'
Less than what you're lookin' for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishin' on a falling star
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone (oh yeah)
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
"Now listen"
If you wanna be a singer, or play guitar
Man, you gotta sweat or you won't get far
'Cause it's never too late to work nine-to-five
You can take a stand, or you can compromise
You can work real hard or just fantasize
But you don't start livin' 'till you realize -
"I gotta tell ya!"
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you

Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul
God gave rock and roll to you
(To everyone he gave the song to be sung)
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
(To everyone he gave the song to be sung)
Gave rock and roll to you
Saved rock and roll for everyone
Saved rock and roll
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone (Oh yeah)
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
(I know life sometimes can get tough)
Gave rock and roll to you
(I know life sometimes can be a drag)
(But people, we have been given a gift)
Put it in the soul of everyone
(We have been given a road)
God gave rock and roll to you
(And that road's name is... Rock and Roll!" yeah yeah)
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
(And that means you, and)
Gave rock and roll to you
(That means you, and that means you too)
Gave rock and roll to everyone
(How many people here like)
(The sound of Rock n Roll?)
God gave rock and roll to you
I do, I do, I do)
