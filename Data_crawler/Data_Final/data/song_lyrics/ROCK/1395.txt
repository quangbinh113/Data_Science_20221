Song Name: Long Hot Summer Night
It sure was a long
Long, long hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well my heart was way down
Cold cold winter storm
Well my darlin' where can you be?
(Where can you be baby, where can you be?)
There were three sugar walls, and a-two candy cane windows
(Woop, woop, woop, woop)
But the silliest move melted all those inside (all those inside)
Well everybody's on fire, but I'm a
Snowin' in a cold blizzard
Where are you on this a-hot cold summer?
Where are you on this a-hot cold summer?
Where are you on this a-hot cold summer?
Night (night, night)
Around about this time the telephone
Blew its horn across the room
Scared little Annie, clean out of her mind, every time yeah
Roman the Candle, he peeps out of his
Peekaboo hide and seek
And grabbed little Annie from the sinner, just in time
And the telephone a-keeps on screamin'
Yeah-yeah-yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
"Hello," said my shaky voice
"Well, how are you doing?"
I start to stutter
Ah, ah, can't you tell I'm a-doin' fine?
(Can't you tell I'm doin' fine)
It was my baby talkin'
She's way down 'cross the border
She says "I'm goin' to hurry to ya, I've been a fool
And I'm tired of cryin'"
(Ah-ah) so tired of cryin' (ah-ah)
Yeah, I said long (long)
Long (long) hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see
(As far as my eyes can see)
I could feel the heat comin' on
As my baby's gettin' closer
I'm so glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me
(Glad that my baby's coming to recue) I say
So glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me
(Glad that my baby's coming to recue)
Don't cry, my baby's comin' to rescue me
(Glad that my baby's coming to recue)
(Rescue, woo, rescue)
(Rescue, woo, rescue)
(Rescue, rescue) what I say?
(Rescue me, rescue woo)
(Rescue, rescue woo)
(Rescue me, rescue)
