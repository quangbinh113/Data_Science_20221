Song Name: Keep Yourself Alive - Live At The Rainbow
Tell you what
It's time you all enjoy it
Everybody
It's call Keep yourself alive
Yeah right
Keep yourself alive
Get up
Yeah
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Tried to grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Sold a million mirrors in a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a super star"
Tell you just be satisfied, stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
That's right
That's right
Woo!
Well I loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Take you on your time and honey
Honey, you survive
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Hey, thank you
