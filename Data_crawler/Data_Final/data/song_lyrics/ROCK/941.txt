Song Name: Fire It Up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Born to raise hell since I lost my heaven
Couldn't find nine kid, I'm on cloud seven
Cherry top lover with a chemical metal
Heater on high like pot on kettle
Jukebox gospel, raise it up another level
Young street apostles with their hallelujah peddles
Preachers in the bleachers keep on dancin' with the devil
Swingin' with the king like an Elvis made of velvet
Bring the beat, beat back
Bring the beat, beat back (woahhh)
Let me see ya light
Spark the dynamite
Here we go
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
Blaze on
Nuclear radio, kiss the devastation
Cradle to the stadium, burnin' on the pavement
Fishin' for religion on a mission salvation
History's the soundtrack, wake ya generation
Bring the beat, beat back
Bring the beat, beat back (woahhh)
Let me see ya light
Spark the dynamite
Here we go
Fire It Up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on
Hi-hi-higher, hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher (ooouu)
Hi-hi-higher, hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher
Let me see ya light
Spark the dynamite
Here we go
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on
Blaze on
Blaze on
