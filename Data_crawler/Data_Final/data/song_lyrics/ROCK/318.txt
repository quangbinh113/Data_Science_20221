Song Name: I Guess It's Never Enough
Is there a reason you waited so long to tell me?
Just to tell me the truth
What have you got to lose?
'Cause I can't wait for you to figure it out
Left for dead, I guess we'll work out how that
I'm to blame, everyone's talking it up
I guess it's never enough
Maybe I've waited too long to tell you
But here's the truth
Maybe I wasn't the reason you couldn't sleep at night
I'm just a garbage for you to throw broken merchandise
You say you're sorry but madam maybe you think you're wise
I see a reasonable doubt in every single line
'Cause I can't wait for you to figure it out
Left for dead, I guess we'll work out how that
I'm to blame, everyone's talking it up
I guess it's never enough
You're the talk of the town
(Don't talk a piece I'll forget it)
Why don't you figure it out?
(If you could just keep work at it)
Yeah, you're the talk of the town, yeah
Why don't you listen to me?
'Cause I can't wait for you to figure it out
Left for dead, I guess we'll work out how that
I'm to blame, everyone's talking it up
'Cause I can't wait for you to figure it out
Left for dead, I guess we'll work out how that
I'm to blame, everyone's talking it up
I guess it's never enough
I guess it's never enough
I guess it's never enough
