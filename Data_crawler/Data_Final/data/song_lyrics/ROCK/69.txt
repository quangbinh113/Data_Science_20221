Song Name: Divide
Is this a nightmare?
Where no one fights fair
I get the same stare
Don't risk thinking
We're barely human
We self abuse and
What's so confusing?
Just keep sleeping
Trapped within our flesh and blood
Medicated till we're done
'Cause you're sick, you're bred into it
Our families fed into it
Oh, it's so pathetic
We'll never break free
The truths alive
You fail the soul
So paralyzed
You choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Watch the divide
They'll entertain you
Control the ways to
Can it sustain through
Generations
You feel connected
Through self expression
Don't ask a question
Or they might kill you
Trapped within our flesh and blood
Medicated till we're done
'Cause you're sick, you're bred into it
Our families fed into it
Oh, it's so pathetic
We'll never break free
The truths alive
You fail the soul
So paralyzed
You choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Watch the divide
I can't fucking take it
We falter as they flourish
They fill their banks with lies
We see our peace discouraged
Our will to fight subsides
The truths alive
You fail the soul
So paralyzed
You choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Choose a side
They will take it all
They will take it all
Watch the divide
