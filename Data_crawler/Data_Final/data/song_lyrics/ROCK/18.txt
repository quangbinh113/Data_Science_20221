Song Name: September Rain
My pain clouding my brain
I pray I will find me again
I'm crossing the white lines
The flies are crawling up and out my eyes
Will I sleep when I die?
When will I feel alive?
Will I sleep when I die?
When will I feel alive?
September rain, watch it fall away
I separate and wash away
When I'm descending, oh, it's never ending
Away
Watch me wash away!
Heart rips, tearin' and splits
I wish I wouldn't make me so sick
I can't drown it out, the night is callin'
Can you hear it now?
Will I sleep when I die?
When will I feel alive?
Will I sleep when I die?
When will I feel alive?
September rain, watch it fall away
I separate and wash away
When I'm descending, oh, it's never ending
Away
Watch me wash away!
Fallin' under, oh
Fallin' under, yeah
Fallin' under, yeah
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
September rain, watch it fall away
I separate and wash away
When I'm descending, oh, it's never ending
Away
Watch me wash away!
I'm fallin' under, yeah
I'm fallin' under, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm fallin' under, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
