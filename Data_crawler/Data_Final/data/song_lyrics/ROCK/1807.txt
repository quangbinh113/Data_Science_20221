Song Name: Life's Been Good - Live; 1999 Remaster
I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all
They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far
My Maserati does 185
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a Limo, ride in the trunk
I lock the doors in case I get drunk
I make hit record, my fans, they can't wait
They write Tim letters, tell Glenn Don's great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody says I'm cool, he's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far
I go to parties, sometimes until 4:00
It's hard to leave when you can't find some more
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, we're all insane
They say I'm lazy, but it takes all my time
(Everybody say oh, yeah, oh, yeah) oh, yeah
Keep on going, guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, ooh
Thank you
