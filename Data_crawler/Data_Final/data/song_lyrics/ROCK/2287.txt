Song Name: Fire In Cairo
Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, the nighttime follows
Silence and black, mirror pool
Mirrors the lonely place where I meet you
See your head in the fading light
And through the dark, your eyes shine bright
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Shifting crimson veil, silken hips
Slide under my hand, solar lips
Whisper my name and I yearn
You take me in your arms and start to burn
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
Then the heat disappears
And the mirage fades away
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E-I-N-C-A-I-R-O
Burn like a fire in Cairo
Burn like a
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)
Blaze like a fire in Cairo
Blaze like a
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)
Flare
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
