Song Name: Dandelions
I've waited so long to be swept out with the tide
I burn up my youth, playing it lose
Just trying to survive
I sold my tears (sold my tears)
And I paid my dues
I faced my fears (faced my fears)
And I sang the blues
I sang for you (for you, I sang for you)
When there's no one left to love
And we've all turned to dust (dust)
We float like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
When there's no one left to trust
And we're all out of luck (luck)
We grow like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
I've been here so long in these cold and lonely nights (nights)
I ran from my past, hoping it'd last
Frozen here in time (time)
I sold my soul (sold my soul)
And I lost my way
I spill my blood (spill my blood)
And you rode my wave
You dug my grave (you dug my grave)
When there's no one left to love
And we've all turned to dust (dust)
We float like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
When there's no one left to trust
And we're all out of luck (luck)
We grow like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
We all turn
We all turn to dust
We all turn
We all turn to dust
When there's no one left to love (love)
And we've all turned to dust
We float like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
When there's no one left to trust
And we're all out of luck (luck)
We grow like dandelions (lions)
And ravage everything we touch
