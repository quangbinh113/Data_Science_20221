Song Name: Behind Your Walls
Tell me how do I reach you when all I see is a stare?
How do you look for the signs when nothing is there?
So you think
When the water won't cut the flame
And the anger drives you insane
Tell me how does it look from behind your walls of pain?
Tell me how do I reach you when all I see is a stare?
How do you look for the signs when nothing is there?
So you think
When the water won't cut the flame
And the anger drives you insane
Tell me, how does it look from behind your walls of pain?
Walls of pain
BÐµhind the walls, behind the walls of pain (Pain)
When you just can't take anymore
And the last lights fade from the shore
Tell me how does it look from behind your walls of pain?
I've been thinking
Spend my time worrying
About the way you don't seem the same
Hoping, waiting
For back to how you were again
There's gotta be something
I can say
Behind the walls, behind the walls of pain (Pain)
When the faces all look the same
And the angels cry out your name
Tell me how does it look from behind your walls of pain?
I've been thinking
Spend my time worrying
About the way you don't seem the same
Hoping, waiting
For back to how you were again
There's gotta be something
I can say
Tell me how do I reach you when all I see is a stare?
How do you look for the signs when nothing is there?
So you think
But I'm stepping out on the ledge
So before you go over the edge
Tell me how does it look from behind your walls of pain?
Behind your walls of pain
Behind your walls of pain
Behind your walls of pain
Behind your walls of pain
