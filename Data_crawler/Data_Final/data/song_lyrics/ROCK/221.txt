Song Name: The Chemistry (Between Us)
I never gained
End the game
Calm me over
Never again
Will I gain?
I'm against me, why?
Come up again and again
Overpower, enough of shame
Enter fame, up again, unwise
It's all a game
We fall in love again
With someone after all
Whenever I'm a saint
I'll pay it all in cents
I never gained
End the game
Calm me over
Never again
Will I gain?
I'm against me, why?
Come up again and again
Overpower, enough of shame
Enter fame, up again, unwise
It's all a game
We fall in love again
As easy it should be
Whenever I'm a saint
I'll pay it all in cents
Silky colored
Will you love me?
Silky colored
Will you leave me?
Silky colored
Indecision
Silky colored
Cause I'm Asian
We fall in love again
With someone after all
Whenever I'm a saint
I'll pay it all in cents
I'll pay it all in cents
We fall in love again
We fall in love again
