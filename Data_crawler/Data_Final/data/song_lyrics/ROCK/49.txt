Song Name: TAKE THIS CROWN (feat. Good Charlotte)
Woke up to the sirens
Still might be a good day
I got some shit that I'm hiding
But I kill myself real slowly
So pour another one for me
Let me see how fast I fall
I got some friends who might never leave
I ain't seen them since I been gone, but I'm holding on
Take this crown away from me (take this crown away from me)
I hold myself with no esteem (I hold myself with no esteem)
There's no joy in victory (there's no joy, there's no joy)
All my heart feels is defeat
See me right back where I started
They kept me so in the dark there
I try to relate with these people
They can't see my face in this place, I don't need you
I pray for the things that I wanted
I got them each nail in my coffin
Then realize we're all broken-hearted
This game it was over
The day that we started
Take this crown away from me (take this crown away from me)
I hold myself with no esteem (I hold myself with no esteem)
There's no joy in victory (there's no joy, there's no joy)
All my heart feels is defeat (all my heart feels is defeat)
No kingdom, no reason
Can't feel it, I can't see them
Take this crown away from me (take this crown away from me)
Looking for something that I can hold to
You can't tell on the outside
Something crazy, I never told you
I dig a grave full of my lies
Can you understand my truth?
Then you might know why
Night terrors, they creep in my room
But still, I hold mine
(All my heart feels is defeat)
Take this crown away from me (take this crown, take this crown)
I hold myself with no esteem (I hold myself with no esteem)
There's no joy in victory (there's no joy, there's no joy)
All my heart feels is defeat (all my heart feels is defeat)
No kingdom, no reason
Can't feel it, I can't see them
So take this crown away from me (take this crown away from me)
No kingdom, no reasons
No love here, no seasons
So take this crown away from me
(Take this crown away from me)
