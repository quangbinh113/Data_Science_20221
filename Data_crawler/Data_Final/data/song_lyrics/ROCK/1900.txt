Song Name: Let's Get It Up
My, My, My
Lose lips, sink ships
So come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Crusing on the seven seas
A pirate on my knobby knees
I'm never going down, never going down
So let's get it up
Let's get it up
Get right up, yeah
Let's get it up
Right to the top
Let's get it up
Right now
Lose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So screw em off and plug em in
Let's switch it off and and start all over again
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Ticking like a time bomb
Blowing up the fuse box
I'm never going down, never going down
So let's get it up
Let's get it up
Get it up oh oh
Let's get it up
Right to the top
Let's get it up
Right now
Get up
Come on here, right now
Let's get it up
Come on let's get it up
Hey get it get it
Let's get it up
Switch it on start it up
Let's get it up oh yeah yeah
Let's get it up
Let's get it up
Let's get it up
Let's get it up
Get it up
Get it up
Get it up
Right up
