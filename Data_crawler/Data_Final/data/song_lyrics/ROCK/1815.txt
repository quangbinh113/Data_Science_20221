Song Name: Good Vibrations - Remastered 2001
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitations)
She's giving me the good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitations)
She's giving me the good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitations)
She's giving me the good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitations)
She's giving me the good vibrations (ooh bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Ah, my, my, what a sensation)
(Ah, my, my, what elations)
(Ah my, my, what)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
Ah
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop, bop, excitations)
She's giving me the good vibrations (good, good, good, good vibrations)
