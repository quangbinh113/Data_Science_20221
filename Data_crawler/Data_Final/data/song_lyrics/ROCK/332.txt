Song Name: Madame Murder
I woke up from a dream
I cannot believe what I had seen
A gunshot wakes me still
See a cowboy smoking himself ill
His mistress waits at night
He's a sinner just like you and I
As she kisses on his neck
He forgets about his own respect
His wife comes homes just to pray
Door sways open to a pale face
Bullets spray with mal-intent
He knew better but still came to collect
There is blood upon the wall
He made a killer to his fault
I woke up from a dream
I cannot believe what I had seen
