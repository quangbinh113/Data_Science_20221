Song Name: Listen to the Music
Don't you feel it growin' day by day?
People gettin' ready for the news
Some are happy some are sad...
Oh... we got to let the music play
Umm-hmm
What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through...
Oh now mama don't you ask me why
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
All the time...
Well I know you know better everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh... we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feelin' good to you
And you're feelin' good to me
There ain't nothin' we can't do or say
Feelin' good, feeling fine
Oh, baby let the music play
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
All the time...
Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
All the time...
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
All the time...
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music
All the time...
Whoa oh whoa...
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)

Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
All the time...
Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
Whoa oh whoa... Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
All the time
Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
Whoa oh whoa... (Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
Whoa oh whoa... Listen to the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the music)
