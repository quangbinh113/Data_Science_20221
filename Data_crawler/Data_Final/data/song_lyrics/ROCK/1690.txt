Song Name: Chocolate Drops
When your love of life is an empty beach
Don't cry, don't cry
When your enemy has you in his reach
Don't die, don't die
When it's painful to express the pains you feel, inside
When it hurts to share because they're bare and real, so real
So every day is judgement day, I will pray, I will pray
When there is no one to share that empty chair, well OK, OK
When you get to the bottom you 're near the top
Where shit turns into chocolate drops
When you get to the bottom you 're near the top
Where shit turns into chocolate drops, drops
So fly, so fly
So fly, so fly
When your love of life is an empty beach
Don't cry
When it's painful to express the things you feel
Inside
When you get to the bottom you 're near the top
Where shit turns into chocolate drops
When you get to the bottom you 're near the top
Where shit turns into chocolate drops
There's nothing in the stars
If you fail to move
There's nothing in the dark
It's just some old excuse
Hangin'on, let it go
