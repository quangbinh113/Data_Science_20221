Song Name: Omens
(Omens, omens)
I cut the weight of connection and lead myself astray
The end will justify the means, but in the end it stays the same
There's nothing left at all, nothing left to see
A restrictive empty exercise within a hollow scheme
Do you see the omens?
Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
Omens
Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
An endless recitation thrown right through the looking glass
I'm trapped inside a parody, a fabricated past
Searching for release from all this rising stress
Charted past the point of caring with a broken compass
Motes in the eye of God, indulging Armageddon
The devil slits the muse's throat and drinks her last confession
Do you see the omens?
Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
Omens
Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
I've fallen out of touch with who you think I am
I can't pretend to care or bother to condemn
All this rising apathy, it's growing everyday
I can't pretend to care about how this will end
All I see are omens
Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
I see omens
I hear omens
I say
Fuck it all, ignore the omens!
