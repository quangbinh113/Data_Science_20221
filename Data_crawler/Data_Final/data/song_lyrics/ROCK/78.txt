Song Name: A Disappearing Act
He lives inside an existence that strays far beyond
The time perceived as normal, bends all limitation
A king among the binary waves conjoined
In our reality, perceived to be null and void
While I wait for him to show me a sign or be destroyed
I implore... go on walk all over me
I'm a long, long way from giving up
Call me old-fashioned, call me a fool
His eyes a shade from waking up
A boy lost in the pattern
Over and over repeat
How long have you waited here?
For someone to touch you
For someone to hear you scream?
It's okay to be afraid, I'm here with you
Will we allow ourselves a cure before it does harm?
How long before the mind it gets too weak
Before it fails to witness
Before it gets a fair chance to start?
I'm a long, long way from giving up
Call me old-fashioned, call me a fool
His eyes a shade from waking up
A boy lost in the pattern
Over and over repeat
How long have you waited here?
For someone to touch you
For someone to hear you scream?
It's okay to be afraid, I'm here with you
A world in limbo waiting opening up
A world in limbo waiting to open for us
A world in limbo waiting opening up
A world in limbo waiting
A world in limbo waiting opening up
A world in limbo waiting to open for us
A world in limbo waiting opening up
A world in limbo waiting
How long have you waited here?
For someone to touch you
For someone to hear you scream?
It's okay to be afraid, I'm here with you
My love, we'll make it
My hands you can leave or take 'em
We're strong enough to face our fears
Now watch time disappear
Woh-ooo oh-oh-ow
Time disappear
Woh-ooo oh-oh-ow
