Song Name: World Turning
Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just wanna be back where I belong
World turning, mm
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
Maybe I'm wrong, but who's to say what's right?
I need somebody to help me through the night
World turning, mm
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
Maybe I'm wrong, but who's to say what's right?
I need somebody to help me through the night
World turning, mm
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
Turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down
