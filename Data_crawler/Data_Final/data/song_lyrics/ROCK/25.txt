Song Name: Riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
Finally frozen, no more emotion
Started escaping, now everything's numb
Dove in the deep end, stuck and I can't swim
So outta breath, I know I don't have long
Yeah, this is way to much, just give me the rush
Yeah, this is way to much, just give me the rush
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
I'm so ashamed of my vicious problems
Keeping the worst of me all to myself
It's overwhelming, not ever telling
The ones I love that I gotta find help
Yeah, this is way to much, just give me the rush
Yeah, this is way to much
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide
Don't wanna die, I guess I gotta let it go
Don't wanna die, I guess I gotta let it go
Ooooooohhhh
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, yeah
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
