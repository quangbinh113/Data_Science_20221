Song Name: Silver Tongue
Sitting in my ivory tower
Invincible to fall
Some would say my final hour
As you scale the wall
Step inside, I dare you all
And breathe the lies and heed the call
When this all is said and done, I will have my way
And you will take the blame
You're over the line, under the gun
I am the reason for what you've done
Tooth of a crime you can't outrun
Under the spell of my silver tongue, yeah
I swear to God I'll find a way
To prove I still belong
I'd rather watch it burn away
Than say that I was wrong
So step inside, I dare you all
And breathe my fire and heed my call
You're over the line, under the gun
I am the reason for what you've done
Tooth of a crime you can't outrun
Under the spell of my silver tongue
You're over the line, under the gun
I'll keep on scheming for what's to come
Tooth of a crime you can't outrun
Under the spell of my silver tongue
This alliance built on fear and rage
Ends in violence if I have my way
Fear, spite, lie to divide us
Hate, strife, bring decay
You're over the line, under the gun
I am the reason for what you've done
Tooth of a crime you will not outrun
Now you're under the spell of my tongue
You're over the line, under the gun
I am the reason for what you've done
Tooth of a crime you can't outrun
Under the spell of my silver tongue
