Song Name: Spanish Bombs - Remastered
Spanish songs in Andalucía
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of Guardia civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
But after they died it was mockingbird hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
The hillsides ring with free the people
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Oh mi corazón...

Oh mi corazón...
Spanish songs in Andalucía, mandolina, oh mi corazón
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazón

Oh mi corazón...
Oh mi corazón...

Oh mi corazón...
Oh mi corazón...
End
