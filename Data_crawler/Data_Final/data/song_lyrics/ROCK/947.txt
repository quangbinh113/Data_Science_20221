Song Name: Rock Brigade
Well, in the middle of the night and the early morning light
You can hear them a million miles away
They'll be bangin' on their drums bangin' on your door
Waving their flags telling you to score
Watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away
So when they hit your town you'd better get down
I'm telling no lies to you mister
Cause they live for rock'n'roll they'll try to steal your soul
Might even try to steal your sister
Watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Oh no it's the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away, away
So in the middle of the night or the early morning light
If you hear them comin' your way
Well you'd better watch your step don't step out of line
Cause here they come one more time
Watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Oh no it's the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
You better watch for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
I say watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Don't let your eyes off the rock brigade (rock brigade)
They'll be leading you away, away, away
