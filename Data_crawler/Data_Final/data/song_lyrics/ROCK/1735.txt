Song Name: Rock or Bust
Hey, ya here
Are you ready?
We be a guitar band
We play across the land
Shootin' out tonight
Gon' keep you up alright
You hear the guitar sound
Playin' nice and loud
Rock you to your knees
Gonna make your destiny
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock and roll we trust, it's rock or bust, come on
We hear the siren scream
It sound so lean and mean
We love to shake you down
Know what we're talkin' 'bout
We turn the amps up high
The crowd's gonna hit the sky
We play it fast and loose
Because this night we're gonna pull the fuse
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock and roll we trust, it's rock or bust
Hey, ya here
Somebody else's chord?
Maybe up to no good
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
That's right, we're just a band
Yeah, that is true, that's so true
