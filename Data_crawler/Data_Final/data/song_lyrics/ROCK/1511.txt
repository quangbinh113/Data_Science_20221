Song Name: Every Breath You Take
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watchin' you
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watchin' you
(Every breath you take)
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
I'll be watchin' you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every game you play)
I'll be watchin' you
(Every move you make)
(Every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake)
I'll be watchin' you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every claim you stake)
I'll be watchin' you
