Song Name: White Dove
A place without a name
Under a burning sky
There's no milk and honey here
In the land of God
Someone holds a sign it says
We are human too
And while the sun goes down
The world goes by
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
Tat hope will not die
Where the children cry
Waves, big like a house
They're stranded on a piece of wood
To leave it all behind
To start again
But, instead of a new life
All they find is a door that's closed
And they keep looking for
A place called hope
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Can anyone tell me why?
(Can anyone tell me why?)
The children of the world
(The children of the world)
Have to pay the price
(Pay another price)
And now your telling me
You've seen it all before
I know that's right but still
It breaks my heart
Well, the golden lamb we sent
Makes us feel better now
But you know it's just a drop
In a sea of tears
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
