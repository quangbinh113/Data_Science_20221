Song Name: Take Me To The Clouds Above - LMC Vs. U2 / Radio Edit
There's a boy I know
He the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above, clouds above...
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
There's a boy I know
He the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
There's a boy I know
He the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me
Take me to the clouds above
Tell me if it's really love
Tell me if it's really love
Tell me if it's really love...
