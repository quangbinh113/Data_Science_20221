Song Name: I Heard It Through The Grapevine - Edit
Bet you're wondering how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you found someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
People say you hear from what you see
Not, not, not from what you hear
I can't help, bein' confused
If it's true, won't you tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine
