Song Name: From Today
Watching fear take over life, streets go silent cities die
Tomorrow slowly slipped away, lost a friend to one more lie
Are we wrong to be afraid are we strong if we pretend
No matter what, I swear to god
These fucking thoughts, won't keep me down
These fucking thoughts, won't keep me down
I'm going loud into the night, won't give up without a fight
From today from today, you will hear me when I cry
Take my money take my time, you will never take my light
From today from today, all my demons listen to me
Random words turn into knives, hearts get broken over time
Will we let it be the way, knowing hate is at it's prime
Am I wrong to be at rage, am I strong if I engage
No matter what, I swear to god, these fucking thoughts
Won't keep me down, these fucking thoughts
Won't keep me down
I'm going loud into the night, won't give up without a fight
From today from today, you will hear me when I cry
Take my money take my time, you will never take my light
From today from today, all my demons listen to me
Listen to me
Take my money, take my time
You will never take my light
Take my money, take my time
You will never take me, this is my resolution
This is my final stand, I'm going loud into the night
Won't give up without a fight, from today from today
You will hear me when I cry, take my money take my time
You will never take my light, from today from today
All my demons listen to me, this is my resolution
This is my final stand listen to me
This is my resolution, this is my final stand
