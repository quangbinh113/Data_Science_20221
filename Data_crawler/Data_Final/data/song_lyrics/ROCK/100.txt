Song Name: Overrated
She's over me, says I'm overrated
I'm such a freak, yeah, I love the way she hates it
She says I'm a waste of time, and I think she might be right (yeah)
Even if I end up fuckin' famous, she'd say I'm overrated

What did I do this time, mamacita?
Did it cross your mind that I'm no good for ya?
I've realized you overanalyze everythin' I do
Thought I was your vato, guess I'm really not, though
Looks like
She's over me, says I'm overrated
I'm such a freak, I love the way she hates it
She says I'm a waste of time, and I think she might be right (yeah)
Even if I end up fuckin' famous, she'd say I'm overrated
Yeah, I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day lately
And I don't blame me if you really hate me
Been thinkin' 'bout all the dirty things, all the filthy things
We do behind closed doors
I can see how it's gettin' to your head (gettin' to your head)
But I'm just out here tryna make some bread (tryna make some bread)
I thought that we were fine, and you were mine, but
She's over me, says I'm overrated
I'm such a freak, I love the way she hates it
She says I'm a waste of time, and I think she might be right (yeah)
Even if I end up fuckin' famous, she'd say I'm overrated
She's over me, says I'm overrated
I'm such a freak, yeah, I love the way she hates it
She says I'm a waste of time, and I think she might be right (yeah)
Even if I end up fuckin' famous, she'd say I'm overrated
She'd say I'm overrated, yeah
