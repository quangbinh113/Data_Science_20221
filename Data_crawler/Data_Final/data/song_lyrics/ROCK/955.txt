Song Name: Lifeless
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I couldn't breathe as I watched you leave
I thought we had something but I wanted more
I played my cards but I pushed you too hard
I feel like a shipwreck washed up on your shore
Something's happening that I couldn't see
I can't get my head around what you did to me
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone
You left me out on my own
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
I can't let go, it's body and soul
I'm drowning in memories
So, just throw me a line (throw me)
I feel betrayed and my nerves are all frayed
Like the last rose of summer as it dies on the vine
(Ooh) something's happening, but I didn't know
I can't turn the time back and it's starting to show
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
I just can't believe a word they said
I've got these voices in my head
And they won't leave me alone (leave me alone)
So, come on now, come in from the cold
Don't leave me lifeless
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
You said to me, "Take it alone" (take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (you let me)
You left me lifeless
