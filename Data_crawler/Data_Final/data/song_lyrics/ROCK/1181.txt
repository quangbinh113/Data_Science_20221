Song Name: Falling Down
The summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all
We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with god to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said "if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with god to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said "if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"
The summer sun, blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
