Song Name: You Got It
Every time I look into your loving eyes

I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Every time I hold you I begin to understand

Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live (I live)
My life (my life)
To be (To be)
With you (with you)
No one (no one)
Can do (can do)
The things (the things)
You do (you do)
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Anything you want (you got it)
Anything you need (you got it)
Anything at all
Do-do-do-do-doo (oh)
Do-do-do-do-doo (oh, yeah)
Do-do-do-do-doo (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(You got it)
I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything at all (you got it)
Baby
You got it
