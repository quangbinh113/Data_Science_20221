Song Name: Draw The Line
Checkmate honey
Beat'choo at'chor own damn game
No dice honey
I'm livin' on the astral plane
Feet's on the ground
And your head's going down the drain

Oh heads I win, tails you lose
To the never mind
When you Draw The Line
The Indian summer
Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner
And rarely ever left the store
She'd sang and dance all night
And wronged all the right outta me
Oh pass me the vile and cross your fingers
It don't take time
Nowhere to Draw The Line
"High Ho Silver" we were singin' all the cowboy songs
Oh you told Carrie
And promised her you wouldn't be long

Heads I win, tails you lose
Lord it's such a crime
No dice honey
You the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey
You the only one who's got to choose
Where they Draw The Line
Checkmate
Don't be late
Take another pull
That's right
Impossible...
... when you got to be yourself
Your the boss of the toss
The dice... the price
Write yourself a song... and... draw the line
Ooo- line
(Repeat)
