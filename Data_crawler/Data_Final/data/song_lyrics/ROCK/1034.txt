Song Name: 100,000 Years
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
Well, how could you have waited so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up with fear
In a 100,000 years
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up with fear
In a 100,000 years
And baby won't you let me
I think I'm goin' outta my head
I'm just about to, ooh yeah
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while, would you babe?
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
