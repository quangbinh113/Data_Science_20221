Song Name: No Longer Broken
All my defenses are falling down
Leaving me breathless
Can you hear me now?
Lost in the void
Am I dead or alive
One look and then I'm back to life
Nothing's ever going to be the same
My heart only beats your name
I'm no longer broken
Not empty inside
I'm done feeling hopeless
I will survive
I'm no longer broken
All my agressions are calming down
Roses grow from the ashes
I'm reborn right now
Lost in the void
Am I dead or alive
One look and then I'm back to life
Nothing's ever going to be the same
And now I'm no longer broken
Not empty inside
I'm done feeling hopeless
I will survive
I'm no longer broken
I'm ready this time
I'm done feeling hopeless
I will survive
I'm no longer broken
You picked up the pieces
Brought me back to life
All my defenses are falling down
Leaving me breathless
Can you hear me now
I'm no longer broken
Not empty inside
I'm done feeling hopeless
I will survive
I'm no longer broken
I'm ready this time
I'm done feeling hopeless
I will survive
I'm no longer broken
I'm no longer broken
I'm no longer broken
