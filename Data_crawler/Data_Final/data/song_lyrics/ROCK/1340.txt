Song Name: The Rain Song - Remaster
It is the springtime of my loving

The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me Keepers of the Gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh, oh oh
Talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us
But I know that I love you so, oh oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I seek the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the coldest quotient
Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
It's just a little rain, oh, oh, ooh, yeah
