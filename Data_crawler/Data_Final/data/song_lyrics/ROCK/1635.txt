Song Name: Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad - Remastered
It's "Lucy in the sky" and all kinds of apple pie
She giggles at the screen 'cos it looks so green
There's carpets on the pavements
And feathers in her eye
But sooner or later
Her new friends will realize
That Julie's been working for the drug squad
Julie's been working for the drug squad
She can even look you in the eye
Well it seemed like a dream
Too good to be true
Stash it in the bank while the tablets grow high
In their millions
And everybody's high
Hi, man
But there's someone looking down
From that mountainside
Cause Julie's been working for the drug squad
Cause Julie's been working for the drug squad
Gumbo
Ten years for you
Nineteen for you
And you can get out in twenty-five
That is if you're still alive
Oh, alive
Oh yeah, alive
Oh, alive
Oh
And then there came the night of the greatest ever raid
They arrested every drug that had ever been made
They took eighty-two laws
Through eighty-two doors
And they didn't halt the pull
Till the cells were all full
'Cos julie was working for the drug squad
Julie's been working for the drug squad
They put him in a cell
They said you wait here
You've got the time to count all of your hair
You've got fifteen years
A mighty long time
You could have been a physicist
But now your name is on the mailbag list
Julie's been working for the drug squad
Julie's been working for the drug squad
Gumbo
Ten years for you
Nineteen for you
And you can get out in twenty-five
That is if you're still alive
Oh, alive
You're still
I said, you're stil
