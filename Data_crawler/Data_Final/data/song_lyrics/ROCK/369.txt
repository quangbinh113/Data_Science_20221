Song Name: Bloodshot
Barely
Hanging on
Yeah you struggle to survive
You've got money for groceries
And cash to get high
Oh you stare into the sun
But it hurts your eyes
Oh you like the pain
What it does to your mind
You hitchhiked a ride
A couple counties away
Your buddy's got a place
He might let you stay
A button-down shirt
A nice pair of slacks
Wake up for nothin'
No one's calling you back
Bloodshot Late nights
Swim through
The red wine
Bloodshot
Half lies
Swim through
The red
Hold onto the fire's coal
Sleep until you never get old
It's not like you do what you're told
Just hold onto the fire
Got a paper tongue
A finger to your lips
She said
Hush little baby
Gonna sink this ship
I'm feeling through the flowers
Had a brush with the night
You're a one-trick pony
On a carousel ride
Oh I found a destination
We were caught up on a trip
Looking for a journey
We were calling it quits
But no one ever told me
It would be this way
So break me down easy
I got nothing to say
Bloodshot
Late nights
Swim through
The red wine
Bloodshot
Half lies
Swim through
The red
Hold onto the fire's coal
Sleep until you never get old
It's not like you do what you're told
Just hold onto the fire
