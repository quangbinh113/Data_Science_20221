Song Name: Can't Stop Lovin' You
Hah
There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothin's gonna come
Oh no, nothin's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh, could you let it be?
I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
You have to hear me say
I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
But you know my heart is true, oh-oh
I can't stop loving you
You can change your friends, your place of life
You can change your mind
We can change the things we say and do anytime
Oh no, but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh baby, I'll be there
Yeah, hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on
I just wanna hear you say
I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true, oh-oh
I can't stop lovin' you
Oh, I'm so twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender
And when it's over
I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die
Oh, not fade away
And I can't stop lovin' you
No matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true, oh-oh
I can't stop lovin' you
And I know what I got to do
And babe, what you said is true, oh-oh
I can't stop lovin' you, oh
Oh, I can't stop lovin' you
