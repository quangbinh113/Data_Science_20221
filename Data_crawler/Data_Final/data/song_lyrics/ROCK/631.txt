Song Name: Sirens
Can you put me back together please?
Right now darling I'm a disassembled body of a human being
Sirens woke me up this morning
I wondered who was hurt, who had fallen
Then I saw the screams were coming from me
I was looking down at my own body
You don't realize how bad it's gotten till you go too far
To undo the damage you've done to your own heart
Can you put me back together please?
Right now darling I'm a disassembled body of a human being
Right now darling my best days are far behind me
And I don't wanna die incomplete
Can you put me back together please?
I know we're probably bad for each other
But sometimes I just need to feel another
Hurting heart beating against mine
Cause then I don't feel so alone at night
You don't realize how bad it's gotten till you go too far
To undo the damage you've done to your own heart
Can you put me back together please?
Right now darling I'm a disassembled body of a human being
Right now darling my best days are far behind me
And I don't wanna die incomplete
No I don't wanna die!
Love drunk
Stitch me up
Drank it all from your empty cup
I hate you
To the moon
Stuck on earth
But I'm leaving soon
(Leaving soon)
Love drunk
Stitch me up
Drank it all from your empty cup
I hate you
To the moon
Stuck on earth
But I'm leaving soon
(But I'm leaving soon)
And I don't wanna die incomplete
Can you put me back together please?
