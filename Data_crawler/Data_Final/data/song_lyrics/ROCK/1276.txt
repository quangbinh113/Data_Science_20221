Song Name: The Invisible Man - Remastered 2011
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
(Freddy Mercury)
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
(John Deacon)
Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Hah, hah, hah, hello (professor)
Hah, hah, hah, okay (professor)
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello
Hello-hello
Never had a real good friend
Not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through
Let my flag unfurl
So l make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
(Brian May, Brian May)
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
Don't you look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
Can't shake me, shake me, dear
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me (watch me)
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
(Look at me, look at me)

(Roger Taylor)
Shake you, shake you, shake you, dear
