Song Name: I'm Outta Time
Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we'd done
You gotta keep on keeping on

Out to sea
It's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some peace of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I am to go
In my heart you'd grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I am to go
In my heart you'd grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I am to go
In my heart you'd grow
And that's where you belong
Guess I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
