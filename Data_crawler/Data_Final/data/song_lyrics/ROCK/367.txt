Song Name: Stone
Such a heavy mind you got there
I'm already high, but thank you
You've been watching me
From so far away
Punch my lip and I'll grant your wish
I guess we're not done being kids
I will stare into this phone until I turn to stone
Do you feel alone
I do
I do
Stalked from stalk to stalk from branches
Heard the words I talked behind backs
Do you wanna be
Petty just like me
I don't care but
Maybe a bad apology
Is enough to make up for what I did
You keep talking to yourself
In front of everyone else
'Til they say
Are you okay
Punch my mouth and nothing comes out
What did you need
I needed help
Hate me three times more than you did
You can come get all of your shit
I will stare into this phone until I turn to stone
You are all alone
I am all alone
Do you even know
I do
I do
