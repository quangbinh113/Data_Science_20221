Song Name: Never Been To Spain - Live at Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA - April 10, 1972
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say, the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it, never gonna lose
Oh, I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
So I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it to Virginia, ooh
I got to feel it, must be near
Oh it feels so good, feel so good
Well I've never been to Heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona, yeah
What does it matter
What does it ma...
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it, they never gonna lose it
Yeah, I can't refuse it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Well, I've never been to Heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
Oh yeah In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
What does it matter
In Oklahoma or Arizona
Yeah, what does it matter
What does it matter
"Thankyou, you're beautiful"
"Thankyou, okay, thankyou"
