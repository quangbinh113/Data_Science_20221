Song Name: Bankrobber
My Daddy was a bankrobber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
Some is rich and some is poor
And thats the way the world is
And I don't believe in lying back
And saying how bad your life is
So we came to jaz it up
Never loved a shovel
Break your back earn your pay
And don't forget to grovel
Daddy was a bankrobber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to take your money (What law?)
The old man spoke up in a bar
Said I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison
Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
What do you think they want to say to us
While we were being clever
Someday you'll meet your rockin chair
Cause that's where we're spinnin
There's no point to want to comb your hair
When its grey and thinin (Hey)
Hey
Daddy was a bankrobber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
So we came to jaz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back earn your pay
And don't forget to grovel (Hey)
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away
Daddy was a bankrobber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
Run, Laddy, run
Strike out boy
For the hills
I can't find that hole in the wall
I know that they never will
My Daddy was a bankrobber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
