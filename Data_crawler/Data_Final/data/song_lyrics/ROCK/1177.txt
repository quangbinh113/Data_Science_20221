Song Name: I Hope, I Think, I Know - Remastered
They're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I've gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's no disgrace
'Cause in the end the past means nothing
You tell me I'm free then you tie me down
And from my chains I think it's a pity
What did it cost you to wear my crown?
You don't like me, why don't you admit it?
I feel a little down today and I ain't got much to say
But you're gonna miss me when I'm not there
You know I don't care
You know I don't care
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know if I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall 'cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's your disgrace
'Cause in the end, your laugh means nothing
To feel a little down today but you ain't got much to say
Who's gonna miss you when your not there
You know we don't care
You know we don't care
'Cause as we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know if I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall 'cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know, if I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall 'cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
