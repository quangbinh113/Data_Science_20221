Song Name: All Hell's Breakin' Loose
Street hustler comes up to me one day
And I'm walkin' down the street
Mindin' my own business
Now he looks me up and he looks me down and says
"Hey man, what be this" and "What be that"
And "Why you gotta look like that?"
Well I just looked at him, I kinda laughed, I said
"Hey man, I am cool, I am the breeze"
Haven't you heard, there's a new revolution
Gotta spread the word, too much confusion
(All hell's breakin' loose) Hey hey have you read the news?
(All hell's breakin' loose) Overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
(All hell's breakin' loose) Day and night, baby, night and day
(All hell's breakin' loose) In the streets there's a brand new way, yeah
You know we ain't always winners
But this is the life we choose
And we won't change or rearrange
And we ain't never ever gonna lose
It ain't always easy
When the goin' gets rough
When you're gettin' even
You gotta show your stuff, tell about it now
Take a look around, only one solution
Set the world on fire, fight the institution
Gonna stand our ground, feel the new sensation
Something's goin' down, ooh, rock the nation
(All hell's breakin' loose) Hey hey have you read the news?
(All hell's breakin' loose) Overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
(All hell's breakin' loose) Day and night, baby, night and day
(All hell's breakin' loose) Ah, take it
Haven't you heard, only one solution
Gotta spread the word, you gotta tell it to the people right now
Take a look around, feel the new sensation
Set the world on fire, ooh, rock the nation
(All hell's breakin' loose)
(All hell's breakin' loose)
(All hell's breakin' loose)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, whoo
(All hell's breakin' loose) Hey hey have you read the news?
(All hell's breakin' loose) Overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
(All hell's breakin' loose)] Day and night, baby, night and day
(All hell's breakin' loose) In the streets, you can hear them say
(All hell's breakin' loose) Hello people, have you read the news?
(All hell's breakin' loose) Overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
(All hell's breakin' loose) It's day and night, baby, night and day
(All hell's breakin' loose) In the streets, you can hear them say
(All hell's breakin' loose) Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All hell's breakin' loose) Yeah, yeah
(All hell's breakin' loose) Hello people, have you read the news
