Song Name: One Vision - Remastered 2011
One man one goal one mission
One heart one goal just one solution
One flash of light yeah one god One Vision
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One voice one hope
One real decision
Wowowowo gimme One Vision

No wrong no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood no stain
All we need is one world wide vision
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One race one hope
One real decision
Wowowowo oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I had a dream
When I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dreams
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction
One world one nation
Yeah One Vision
No hate no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration wowowowo yeah
One one one one...
One Vision...
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One voice one hope
One real decision
Gimme one light
Gimme one hope
Just gimme
One man one man
One bar one night
One day hey hey
Just gimme gimme gimme gimme
Fried chicken
