Song Name: End - Live In Paris / 1992
I think I've reached that point
Where giving up and going on
Are both the same dead end to me
Are both the same old song
I think I've reached that point
Where every wish has come true
And tired, disguised, oblivion
Is everything I do
Please stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things
Please stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things
I am none of these things
None of these things
I think I've reached that point
Where all the things you have to say
And hopes for something more from me
Are just games, to pass the time away
Stop loving me
Stop loving me
I am none of these things
Stop loving me
Loving me
I am none of these things
I am none of these things
(I am, none of these, things)
I think I've reached that point
Where every word that you write
Of every book I've seen
And every sober night
And every dream you dream me in
And every perfect free from sin
And burning eyes, and hearts on fire
Are just the same, old song
Stop loving me
Stop loving me
I am none of these things
Stop loving me
Stop loving me
I am none of these things
None of these things
Stop loving me
Stop loving me
I am none of these things
Stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things
I am none of these things
(I am, none of these, things)
