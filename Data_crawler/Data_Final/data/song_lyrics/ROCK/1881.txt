Song Name: Viva Las Vegas
Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
And even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack, and poker, and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashin'
And your one arm bandits crashin'
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime
And turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once, you'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck, please, let the dice stay hot
And let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vega, Viva, Viva Las Vegas
