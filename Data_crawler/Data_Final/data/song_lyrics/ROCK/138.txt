Song Name: Talk & Walk
Where you going now?
Where you going now?
Lying just a little bit
What's it all about?
What's it all about?
Hiding every piece of it
Never find out
We'll never find out
I can't believe how far you'd go to leave the truth out
It's such sickness
How can you live this?
Can't believe how far you'd go to keep us in this
You'd like me to believe in you
But you haven't got a clue
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
But now that's over
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
The lies you own them
You say just what I need to hear
Every little bit
You won't get away with it
You let the secret out
Now you scream and shout
Is anybody listening?
Live your life in doubt
Hope they don't find out
The truth is really sickening
All around now
It's all around now
I can't believe how far you'd go to leave the truth out
So many fires
When you're a liar
I can't believe how far you'd go
You must be tired
You'd like me to believe in you
But you haven't got a clue
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
But now that's over
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
The lies you own them
You say just what I need to hear
Every little bit
You won't get away with it
You've gone too far
Yeah, no one can save you
It's all your fault
And nobody made you
Choke on your words
The world you created
It's falling down
You are a liar
Liar
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
But now that's over
Talk a little bit
Walk a little bit
The lies you own them
You say just what I need to hear
Every little bit
You won't get away with it
You won't get away with it
You won't get away with it
