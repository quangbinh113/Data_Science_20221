Song Name: Graveyard
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Nothing but misery and loneliness
Under this ground
Surrounded by skeletons
That were lost and never found
Buried in complacency, but it's time for me to get out
When it's time to leave the dead things behind
I'm feeling my heartbeat now
(I'm feeling my heartbeat now)
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Looking back into this grave I see
There's a pale, cold lifeless version of me
But I'm finally out of this hole, reclaim my soul
Filling all the vacancy with the new world that I found
And it's time to leave the dead things behind
I'm feeling my heartbeat now
(I'm feeling my heartbeat now)
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
I'm ringing the bell
Six feet further from hell
I'm ringing the bell
Six feet further from hell
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Out of this graveyard
