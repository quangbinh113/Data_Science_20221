Song Name: Otherside
Aye
Are you dying to live
Or living to die?
When you meet your maker
Is your head held high? (High)
Who did you love?
What did you give? (Who did you love, what did you give)
What did you take?
What did you burn? (Burn, burn)
Was something missed? (Missed)
Do you dream of something more (more)
Before death comes knocking at your door?
Going to ride this feeling, gonna free my mind (mind)
Gonna live my moment, gonna chase this high (high)
Nothing lasts forever, so I let it fly (fly)
'Cause I can't take it with me to the otherside
The otherside, the otherside
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
The otherside, the otherside
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
Did you dig for the dollar? (Dollar)
Did you lie for the gold? (Gold)
Did you get what you wanted? (Wanted)
Did you sell your soul?
Who did you hurt?
How did it feel? (Feel, who did you hurt? How did it feel?)
How did you break?
What was it worth? (Worth)
And will it heal? (Heal)
'Cause there's truth you can't ignore (ignore)
Before death comes knocking at your door
Gonna ride this feeling, gonna free my mind (mind)
Gonna live my moment, gonna chase this high (high)
Nothing lasts forever, so I let it fly (fly)
'Cause I can't take it with me to the otherside
The otherside, the otherside
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
The otherside, the otherside
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
Uh-ahh
Yeah
Gonna ride this feeling, gonna free my mind
Gonna live my moment, gonna chase this high
Nothing lasts forever, so I let it fly
'Cause I can't take it with me to the otherside
The otherside, no, no
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
No, I can't take it with me to the otherside
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Woah!
The otherside, the otherside
