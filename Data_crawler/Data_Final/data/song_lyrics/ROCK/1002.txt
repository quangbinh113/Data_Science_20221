Song Name: Reason To Live
Out of love
There's nobody around
All I hear is the sound of a broken heart
Out of time
No more waiting for you
Now the hurting's through and a new day starts
And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights and made it alive
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
Out of touch
With myself for so long
Now a feeling so strong coming over me
Down the line
There's a lesson I've learned
You can love and get burned if it has to be
And I see a change in my life
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside and I realize
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
And I feel a change in my life
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside and I realize

Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
No, it can't be your love
No, it can't be your love
No, it can't be your love
