Song Name: Surfin' U.S.A. - Remastered 2001
If everybody had an ocean
Across the U.S.A.
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californ-I-A
You'd see 'em wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo
Surfin' U.S.A.
You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar (inside, outside U.S.A.)
Ventura county line (inside, outside U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestle (inside, outside U.S.A.)
Australia's Narrabeen (inside, outside U.S.A.)
All over Manhattan (inside, outside U.S.A.)
And down Doheny way (inside, outside)
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
We'll all be planning out a route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
And Haggerties and Swamies (inside, outside U.S.A.)
Pacific Palisades (inside, outside U.S.A.)
San Onofre and sunset (inside, outside U.S.A.)
Redondo Beach L.A. (Inside, outside U.S.A.)
All over La Jolla (inside, outside U.S.A.)
At Waimea Bay (inside, outside)
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
Yeah, everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
Yeah, everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
