Song Name: Rainy Day, Dream Away
Cough, cough, sniff, sniff
Hey man, take a look out the window
And see what's happening
Hey man, its rainin' its rainin' outside man
Oh don't worry about that, brother
Everything's gonna be everything
We'll get into something real nice, you know
Why don't ya sit back and groove on a rainy day
Sniff, yeah
Sniff
Yeah I see what you mean brother
Maybe I can groove
Rainy day dream away
Let the sun take a holiday
Flowers bathe and uh
See the children play
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Well I can see a bunch of wet preachers, look at 'em on the run
The carnival traffic noise, it sinks
Into the splashy hum
Even the ducks can groove
Rain burdened in a park-side pool
And I'm leanin' out my window sill
Diggin' everything
And uh you too
Rainy day rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' up tight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain
Your worries away
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
