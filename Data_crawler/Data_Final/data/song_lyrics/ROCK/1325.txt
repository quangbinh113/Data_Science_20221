Song Name: Kashmir - Remaster
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, with stars to fill my dream.
I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been.
To sit with elders of a gentle race this world has seldom seen.
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed.
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear.
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear.
Whoa-oh-hoh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oooh, oh, baby, I've been flyin'
No, yeah, mama cares, ain't no denyin'
Oh, oooh yeah, I've been flyin'
Mama My, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no...
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground.
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land.
Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah...
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream.
Heed the path that led me to that place with yellow desert stream.
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again.
Sure as the dust that blows high in June, when movin' through Kashmir.
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear.
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-hoh, oh, ohh
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah-eah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, so down...
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there...
Oh, oh, come on, come on, oh, let me take you there...
Let me take you there, woo, yeah-yeah, woo, yeah-yeah
Let me take you there...
