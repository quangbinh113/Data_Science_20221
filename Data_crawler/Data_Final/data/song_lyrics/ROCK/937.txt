Song Name: Gone Shootin'
Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Found a ticket of her own accord
Yeah i don't know
Packed her heart in a travelling bag And never said bye bye
Somethings missing in the neighbourhood
All the cryin' eyes
I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Do a favourite tune
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Wrap yourself around
Like a second skin
Packed her favourite bag
But she could never win
I took your number in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in overdrive
Up until my overkill
She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?
Gone shootin'
She's gone, gone gone gone
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Lil' child
Gone Shootin'
I thought that she wouldn't even know
Gone Shootin
Hey look out, look out, look out, look out!
Gone shootin
She's shootin heroin!
Gone shootin
She's shootin loaded
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Gone shootin
I'm gonna have to get a gun
Look out, look out
She could have anyone
She sure is loaded
I used to love her so
