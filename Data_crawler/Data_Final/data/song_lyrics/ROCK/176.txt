Song Name: Money Spent
All the money spent on you
Can't take me there, way back where you left me
On and on my way to you
Just take me there, right there where you left me
I hate it hurts to think of you
Way back, way back when you loved me
Well, I got better things to do
Than backtrack way back when you loved me, uh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
A bloody nose and I've got the shakes
I'd blame myself, but I'm too ashamed
It makes me think of all the good times
Wе'd drink and watch the sunrise
But the sun is gonе and so are you
Oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ah-la-la
