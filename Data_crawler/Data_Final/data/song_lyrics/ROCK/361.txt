Song Name: Tuning In
Down in the states they got the left versus the right
Media give you news where its side against side
Broadcast a place to do all your hating
Bring out your fear because it gets ratings
Corporations own 'em and they tell 'em what to say
Tellin' all of us to keep our hatred away
From the billionaires that 'cause the real glooming
Tell your fam and your friends that they need to stop
Tuning in
Tuning in
Tuning in
Tuning in
Public consent with a manufacture date
Nothing's ever done at the red and blue debate
Never gonna talk about going green
Doesn't really fit into the money machine
Five corporations own the media outlets
Throw out your cable box and your TV set
Program propaganda that they need consuming
Tell your fam and your friends that they need to stop
Tuning in
