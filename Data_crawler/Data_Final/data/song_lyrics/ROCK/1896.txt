Song Name: Sin City
Diamonds and dust
Poor man last, rich man first
Lamborginis, caviar
Dry martini's, shangri-la
I got a burnin' feelin'
Deep inside o' me
It's yearnin'
But I'm gonna set it free
I'm going in to sin city
I'm gonna win in sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm gonna win in sin city
Oh let me roll ya baby
Ladders and snakes
Ladders give, snakes take
Rich man, poor man
Beggarman, thief
Ain't gonna hope it hell
That's my belief
Finger freddy
Diamond Jim
They're getting ready
Look out I'm comin' in
So sping that wheel cut that pack
And roll them loaded dice
Bring on the dancin' girls
And put the champagne on ice
I'm going in to sin city
I'm gonna win in sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm going in to sin city
