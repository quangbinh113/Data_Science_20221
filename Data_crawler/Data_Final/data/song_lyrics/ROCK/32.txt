Song Name: ANIMAL
I'm not something you can tame that easy, tame that easy
You don't know shit about the pain I'm feeling, pain I'm feeling, yeah
Two-sided like a Gemini, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini-ni
Somebody you don't recognize, recognize, recognize, recogni-nize
Don't tell me that you know me, know me
Saying what I feel, what I do, what I want
Quit acting like you own me, own me
Saying that I'm yours to control, but I'm not
Your animal (ah-ah)
Under control (oh)
Your animal (ah-ah)
Saying what I feel, what I do, what I want
Is this a twisted fantasy? A fantasy, yeah
Some pleasure can be damaging, unfair to be in, yeah
You know I tell you every time, every time, every time, every time
Two-sided like a Gemini, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini-ni
Don't tell me that you know me, know me
Saying what I feel, what I do, what I want
Quit acting like you own me, own me
Saying that I'm yours to control, but I'm not
Your animal (ah-ah)
Under control (oh)
Your animal (ah-ah)
Saying what I feel, what I do, what I want
When you cage an animal
Their claws will start to show
They're aiming at your throat
It's time to let them go
When you cage an animal
Their claws will start to show
They're aimin' at your throat
It's time to let them go
Quit acting like you own me, own me
Saying that I'm yours to control, but I'm not
Your animal (ah-ah)
Under control (oh)
Your animal (ah-ah)
Saying what I feel, what I do, what I want
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
