Song Name: Wind of Change
Follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers
The future's in the air
Can feel it everywhere
I'm blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me (Take me) o the magic of the moment
On a glory night (The glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (with you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (the glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say (say)
Take me (take me) o the magic of the moment
On a glory night (the glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (with you and me)
Take me (take me) o the magic of the moment
On a glory night (the glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
In the wind of change (in the wind of change)
