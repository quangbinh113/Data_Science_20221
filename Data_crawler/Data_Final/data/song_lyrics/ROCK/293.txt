Song Name: No More Tears To Cry
I think it's time to recognise these demons in my head
They're killing me internally, I know they want me dead
Let's take the time to analyse and get this off my chest
By digging up the skeletons to finally confess
Wait, am I losing it?
There's an itch under my skin, is this pain another sin?
Wait, am I losing it?
Will this rope around my neck make it easy to forget?
I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface, there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside of me
So nothing seems to ease my mind, no matter what I try
An endless vicious circle on a loop that won't rewind
I'm outta luck, outta time, is this just all in vain?
I've had enough, I'm giving up, I'm feeling so afraid
Wait, am I losing it?
With no hope, there's nothing left, and you're not afraid of death
Wait, am I losing it?
When you can't rely on faith, cut this cycle of self-hate
I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface, there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface, there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
I'm cut into pieces, pushed over the edge
Feeling so worthless, God, when will this end?
Every minute a battle, an hour a war
Feeling so helpless, God, when will it end?
Nobody's listening, does nobody care?
I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface, there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface, there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
