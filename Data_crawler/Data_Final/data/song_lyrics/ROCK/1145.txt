Song Name: Street Fighting Man - 50th Anniversary Edition
Everywhere I hear the sound of marchin', chargin' feet, boy
'Cause summer's here, and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No
Hey, think the time is right for a violent revolution
But where I live, the game to play is compromise solution
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No
Get down
Hey, said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream
I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No
Get down
