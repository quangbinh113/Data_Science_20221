Song Name: Louie Louie
And now, the news
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I gotta go now
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I really gotta go now
The communist world is fallin' apart
The capitalists are just breakin' hearts
Money is the reason to be
It makes me just wanna sing, Louie Louie
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I gotta go now
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I really gotta go now
And a fine little girl, she is waitin' for me
But I'm as bent as Dostoevsky
I think about the meaning of my life again
And I have to sing, Louie Louie again
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I gotta go now
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I really gotta go now
Oh, let's give it to 'em, right now
Alright
Oh man, I, I dunno like man like you know
I dunno like health insurance
And the homeless and world peace
And aids and education, I mean that
I'm tryin' to do right but hey
Life after Bush and Gorbachev
The wall is down but something is lost
Turn on the news, it looks like a movie
It makes me wanna sing, Louie Louie
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I gotta go now
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, I really gotta go now
Said, I gotta go now
I gotta go now
I really gotta go now
Well, let's go
