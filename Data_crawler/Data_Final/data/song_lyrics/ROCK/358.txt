Song Name: Lemondrops (Radio Edit)
Now that I'm wasting my time I
I see the doubt inside
I see the doubt inside
Holiday it's beginning to be
Such a shitty place
I can't see my fate
The night is growing cold
The night is frozen whole
People dying all around
And they scream to make a sound
People dying all around
And they scream to make a sound
I'm not allowed much danger
I turned my love into a stranger
Take it to the death
It's all I know
Take it to the band
It's all that I can handle
Next day's the weekend love
Next day's the workday mantel
Trouble trouble trouble
The night is growing cold
The night is frozen whole
People dying all around
They don't have to make a sound
People dying all around
And they scream to make a sound
The night is growing cold
The night is frozen whole
The night is growing cold
