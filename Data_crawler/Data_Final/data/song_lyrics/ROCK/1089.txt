Song Name: You See Me Crying
You see me crying don't let it get'cha down
You see me crying I'm back to the lost and found
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words that I said
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words that I said
You see me crying say you're a ladies man
You see me crying I'm so hard to understand
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words that I said
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words that I said
You see me crying please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover honey let me take you to town
And I'll show you everything that I know
And I'll never ever let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry-go-round
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words I said
Honey what'cha done to your head
Honey was the words I said
Aaahh...
