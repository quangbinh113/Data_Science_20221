Song Name: She's a Sensation - 2002 Remaster
She's a sensation
She's a sensation
She looks so sweet
She's a sensation
She's a sensation
Good enough to eat
She's a sensation
Oh, oh, oh
She looks a so fine
She's a sensation
She's a sensation
I'm gonna make her mine
No matter what you do
I give my heart to you
And oh, oh, baby
I will give it to you
No matter what they say
Yeah, we can find a way
And oh, oh, baby
We can find a way
I really didn't know
Till I walked you home
That I feel the way I do
And I don't care
What the neighbors say
I always will be true
I always will love you
Love you, a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
She's a sensation
She's a sensation

She's a sensation
I'm gonna make her mine
No matter what you do

I always will love you
Love you, a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
