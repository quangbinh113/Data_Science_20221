Song Name: Listen Up
Listen up, what's the time?
Said today, I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day there's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think and the words
They won't let you say
One fine day
Gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time
Sailin' down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
Listen up, what's the time?
Said today, I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day there's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think and the words
They won't let you say
One fine day
Gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time
Sailin' down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said, that I don't mind being on my own
Sailin' down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
I said, that I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said, that I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said, that I don't mind being on my own
