Song Name: You Don't Have To Say You Love Me - Live at Madison Square Garden - June 10, 1972, The Afternoon Show
When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you no that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me (believe me), believe me (believe me) I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, oh believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand, believe me (believe me), believe me (believe me)
Oh believe
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
