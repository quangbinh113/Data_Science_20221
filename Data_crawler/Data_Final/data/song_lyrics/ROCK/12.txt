Song Name: curious/furious
I always knew there was an order to this
The wind in the trees whispering mathematics
I always knew I tried my best to talk back
Refract the wisdom to heal the abyss
Somebody needs to know that
And when this life is looking dark, it's all that we have
And when nobody wants to talk about it
All that we can do is step into dread, that's what I said
And I'm takin' this adventure on my own
Walking through a darkened forest, goin' home
Curious, furious, I feel alone, oh, oh
Getting over it now and I
Never wear a frown
Because life doesn't choose either side
Win or lose, right or wrong
It's a battle that's all in your mind
You better open wide
Getting over it now and I
Never wear a frown
Because life doesn't choose either side
Win or lose, right or wrong
It's a battle that's all in your mind
You better open wide
Shielding myself from the depths of my heart
The surface is calm, inside, the chaos restarts
Don't know what to do, my questions endless
And the only thing that I want
I don't wanna start a fight
But you know when it gets heated, that's just what I like
And I never wanna talk about it
I just wanna sit in my room instead, that's what I said
And I'm takin' this adventure on my own
Walking through a darkened forest, goin' home
Curious, furious, I feel alone, oh, oh, oh
Getting over it now and I
Never wear a frown
Because life doesn't choose either side
Win or lose, right or wrong
It's a battle that's all in your mind
You better open wide
Getting over it now and I
Never wear a frown
Because life doesn't choose either side
Win or lose, right or wrong
It's a battle that's all in your mind
You better open wide
