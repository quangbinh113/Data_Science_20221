Song Name: For Your Life - Remaster
You said I was the only, With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit, emotion second hand.
Had to pull away to save me, maybe next time around
And she said, 'don't you wanna'?
Don't you wanna cook it, cook it, cook it?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah.
Heard a cry for mercy, In the cfvity of the damned
Oh oh babe, damned.
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground.
Oh, hello underground.
Wine and roses ain't quite over, fate deals a losing hand

And I said: didn't mean to... did not mean to fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it
You wanna do it, you wanna
You wanna do it when you wanna
You wanna do it, do it when you wanna
When you blow it, babe, You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama, baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama, please fake it right (for yourself babe)
When you fake it baby
You're fakin' it for your life,
For your life, for your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it when you wanna
Oh, I can have you, baby, but I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothin' I could do
On the balance of a crystal, Payin' through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow.
And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please.
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it, I over-ran it, (fryin)
For your life, for your life.
