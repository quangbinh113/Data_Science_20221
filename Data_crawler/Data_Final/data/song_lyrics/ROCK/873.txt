Song Name: Misunderstood
Should I? Could I?
Have said the wrong things right a thousand times
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine
You cried, I died
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south, and
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one
I'm wasting time
When I think about it
I should have drove all night
Would've run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn
Misunderstood
Could I? Should I?
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
Staying out too late with all of my friends
You found me passed out in the yard again
You cried, I tried
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
It's not so bad
You think about it
I should have drove all night
Would've run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn
Misunderstood, intentions good
It's you and I
Just think about it
I should have drove all night
Would've run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
I'm hanging outside your door
I've been here before, misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn
Misunderstood, intentions good
