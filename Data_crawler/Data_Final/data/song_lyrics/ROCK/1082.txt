Song Name: Sunshine
I sold my soul for a
One night stand
I followed Alice into Wonderland
I ate the mushroom and I
Danced with the queen
Yeah, we danced in between
All the lines
I followed daylight right
Into the dark
Took to the Hatter
Like a walk in the park
But then I met her, yeah, she
Felt so right
No child of the night, yeah, was she
They called her Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah, yeah, Sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah, yeah, Sunshine, yeah
Her kind of love's
What I adore
What kind of trouble
Am I in for?
My kind of heaven lies at
Hell's back door
And I got more than I need
'Cause I need Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah, yeah, my Sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah, yeah, Sunshine, yeah
I got the karma but it don't
Come free
I'll chase that rabbit up her bodi tree
The caterpillar's tryin' to
Cop a plea
But the smoke ain't got
Nothin' on me
Ya gotta have my Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah, yeah, my Sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah, yeah
She's Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah, yeah, Sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine
Sunshine, yeah
