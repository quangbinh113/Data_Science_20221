Song Name: Love Of My Life - Remastered 2011
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (my love)
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see? (Please bring it back)
Bring it back, bring it back (back)
Don't take it away from me (take it away from me)
Because you don't know (ooh-ooh-ooh know)
What it means to me (means to me)
You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way (ooh)
When I grow older (yeah)
I will be there at your side (ooh)
To remind you how I still love you (to remind you)
(I still love you)
Back, hurry back (back, back)
Please, bring it back home to me (bring it back home to me)
Because you don't know (ooh-ooh-ooh know)
What it means to me (means to me)
Love of my life
Love of my life
(Ooh, ooh)
