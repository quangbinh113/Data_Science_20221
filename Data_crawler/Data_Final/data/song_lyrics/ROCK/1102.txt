Song Name: Anybody Seen My Baby? - Remastered
She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor
Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize
That she's really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
Getting on a motor bike
Looking rather lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave? Hmm
Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Is she really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around
Oh, yeah
That's what I'm saying
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And The Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody like this
Anybody seen my baby
Has anybody seen her
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around
Oh, yeah
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around (Lost, lost and never found)
Oh, yeah
I must, I must have called her a thousand times
Oh, sometimes I just think she's just in my imagination
Oh, yeah
Lost, lost in the crowd
