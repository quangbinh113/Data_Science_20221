Song Name: 5:15
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau-de-cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
Magically bored
On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes
Quiet stormwater
M-m-my generation
Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows
Inside outside
Leave me alone
Inside outside
Nowhere is home
Inside outside
Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen
Out of my brain on a train
Out of my brain on a train
On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching
He man drag
In the glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous
In my high heel shoes
Tightly undone
Know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news
Inside outside
Leave me alone
Inside outside
Nowhere is home
Inside outside
Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen
Out of my brain on a train
Out of my brain on a train, on a train
Wow, I'm out of my brain
Woo
Out of my brain on a train
Here it comes
Woo!
Out of my brain on a train, on a train
Out of my brain on a train
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
