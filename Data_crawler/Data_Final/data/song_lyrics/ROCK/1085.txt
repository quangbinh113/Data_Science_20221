Song Name: Nine Lives
Well well well
I feel just like i'm fallin' in love
There's a new cool
Some kind of verbooty
That fits me like a velvet glove
And it's cool
Ooh babu dooby
She's talkin'to me juba to jive
Yeah, the girl's in love
No doubt about it
The moment of truth has arrived
And in a wink
The funk was all around me
And i think
I'm dead in love again
Nine lives - feelin'lucky
Nine lives - live again
Nine lives - it ain't over
Nine lives - live for ten
I got good luck
In certain situations
I'm feelin' like i hung the moon
And then at times
I'm so weak from lovin'
I couldn't even carry a tune
But now i'm back
Oh yes i am
I maybe fall apart at the seams
I had a nightmare
Believe me when i tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams
I think, i need a stay of execution
In a wink, i'm dead in love again
Nine lives - puss & booty
Nine lives - live again
Nine lives - it ain't over
Nine lives - live for ten
Well well well
Engine room to bombardier
Is this a dream
I died and went to heaven
She's enough to make you
Cry in your beer
How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip into a fare thee well
And how can one man's
Little bit o' heaven
Turn into another man's hell
I think i need a stay of execution
In a wink, i'm dead in love again
Nine lives - hello lucky
Nine lives - live again
Nine lives - it ain't over
Nine lives - live for ten
Nine lives - takin' over
Nine lives - live again
Nine lives - it ain't over
Nine lives - try for ten
Nine lives - hello lucky
Nine lives - live again
Nine lives - it ain't over
Nine lives - live for ten
