Song Name: Fuck You
Cannot move
The Misery
Need to go back to sleep
Never mind
Fragile mind
Feeling betrayed by this
Empty that's inside of me
The empty that won't seem to leave
You made a promise said that you'd never change
You broke that promise and all I can say is
Fuck you
For making me feel like I do
Whenever you walk in the room
You control me
You take me you own me
Fuck you
I'm a shell of the one I once knew
Cannot speak
Not a peep
Where have I gone and where
Will I be a memory
Never was a part of this
Empty that's inside of me
This empty that won't seem to leave
You made a promise said that you'd never change
You broke that promise and all I can say is
Fuck you
For making me feel like I do
Whenever you walk in the room
You control me
You take me you own me
Fuck you
I'm a shell of the one I once knew
Nothing left for me to hold
I've been down but never felt like this before
Never felt like this before
Fuck you
For making me feel like I do
Whenever you walk in the room
You control me
You take me you own me
Fuck you
I'm a shell of the one I once knew
Fuck you
I'm a shell of the one I once knew
