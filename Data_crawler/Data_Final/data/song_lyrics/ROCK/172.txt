Song Name: Whatever
Can't you see
This ain't what you need
You're swimming in the same recycled shit all over your feed
It's just A-B-C's
It's stuck in your brain
I hate to say this shit is easy
But it's still gonna bang
Come on come on just give it up
Just give it up
Go reign supreme
We're just doing the same damn thing
In a room of empty faces don't go changing
So come on come on
Just give it up
Just give it up
It's so overrated
Come on come on
Just give it up
It's all fake
Can't you think of something new to make
I can't help but notice that
Every single time you open your mouth it's the same damn thing
Looking for gold in the dust on your shelf
Blaming the world when should blame yourself
Go reign supreme
We're just doing the same damn thing
In a room of empty faces don't go changing
So come on come on
Just give it up
Just give it up
It's so overrated
Come on come on
Just give it up
It's all fake
(It's all fucking fake)
I can't remember what you said
But I hear it on the radio all night
I went away to give myself
Another chance to figure it out
Surrender
Whatever
I hope I don't end up like you
Like you
Go reign supreme
We're just doing the same damn thing
In a room of empty faces don't go changing
So come on come on
Just give it up
Just give it up
It's so overrated
Come on come on
Just give it up
It's all fake
It's all fake
It's all fake
Go, go, go, go reign supreme
We're just doing the same damn thing
In a room of empty faces don't go changing
So come on come on
Just give it up
Just give it up
It's so overrated
Come on come on
Just give it up
It's all fake
Can't you think of something new to make
Can't you think of something new to make
Come on come on
Just give it up
Just give it up
