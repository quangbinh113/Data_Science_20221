Song Name: Bonzo Goes to Bitburg
You've got to pick up the pieces
Come on, sort your trash better
Pull yourself back together
Maybe you've got too much cash
Better, call, call the law
When you gonna turn yourself in, yeah
You're a politician
Don't become one of Hitler's children
Bonzo goes to Bitburg
Then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV
Somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town
To understand your foreign policy
Pick up the pieces
(Ah, na-na-na)
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
I need something to slow me down
(Ah, na-na-na) ooh, yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
And I need something to slow me down
Shoulda wished her happiness
Wish her the very best
50,000 dollar dress
Shaking hands with your highness
See through you like cellophane
You watch the world complain
But you do it anyway
Who am I, am I to say?
Bonzo goes to Bitburg
Then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV
Somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town
To understand your foreign policy
Pick up the pieces
(Ah, na-na-na)
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
I need something to slow me down
(Ah, na-na-na) ooh, yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
And I need something to slow me down
There's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind their politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last
(Ah, na-na-na) ooh, yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
I need something to slow me down
(Ah, na-na-na) ooh, yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
And I need something to slow me down
(Ah, na-na-na) ooh, yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
(Ah, na-na-na)
And I need something to slow me down
(Ah, na-na-na)
My brain is hanging upside down
