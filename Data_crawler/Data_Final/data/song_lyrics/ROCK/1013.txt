Song Name: Domino
Lemme tell ya my story
I got a man-sized predicament
And it's a big one
Goes like this, yeah
My my, ow, yeah!
Never had confession
Never had a home
Never had no worry
Until I met Domino
Ain't the virgin Mary
Love her, I confess
Got my hesitations
'Cause she kisses like the kiss of death
Loves lots of money
Back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy
She knows she's got me by the balls
They call her Domino
So fine
Ow
Got a reputation
Haven't got a hope
It's a sticky situation
If she ain't old enough to vote
Loves to play with fire
Loves to hurt so good
Loves to keep me burnin'
'Cause she's a bad habit, bad habit
Bad habit that's good, good, good
They call her Domino
Domino, Domino
Every damn time I walk through that door
It's the same damn thing
That bitch bends over
And I forget my name, ow
Loves lots of money
Back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy
She knows she's got me by the balls - ow!
Loves to play with fire
Love her I confess
Got no hesitations
'Cause she's a bad habit, yeah
Bad habit
She's a bad habit
Yeah
