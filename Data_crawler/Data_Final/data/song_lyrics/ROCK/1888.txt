Song Name: She's Not You
Her hair is soft, and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be, but she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want, but she's not you
And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've gotta stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And when we're dancing
It almost feels insane
I've gotta stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
