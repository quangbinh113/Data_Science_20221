Song Name: Blue Jean Blues - 2005 Remaster
I done ran
Into my baby
And fin'lly found
My old blue jean
I done ran
Into my baby
And fin'lly found
My old blue jean
I could tell that
They was mine
From the oil
And the gasoline
If I ever get back
My blue jean
Lord, how happy
Could one man be
If I ever get back
My blue jean
Lord, how happy
Could one man be
'Cause if I get back
Those blue jeans
You know, my baby
Be, bringin' 'em home to me
