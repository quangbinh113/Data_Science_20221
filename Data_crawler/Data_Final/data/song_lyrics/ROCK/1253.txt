Song Name: Somebody to Love
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end, (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I go down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes Lord
Somebody, (somebody)
Ooh somebody (somebody)
Yeah! Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(He works hard) Everyday (everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah they ain't got no common sense
He's got nobody left to believe in
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Lord)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
Can anybody find me, somebody to love?
(Can't anybody find me someone to love?)
I got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep on losing and losing)
I'm alright, I'm alright (he's alright he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
Wanna hear every single person
See every single of your hands
Three, four!
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody, (somebody)
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody find me
Somebody find me
Somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah!
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love
Find me find, me find, me find, me find me
Ooh somebody to love
Anybody, any way
Anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah, yeah
Thank you very much
Goodnight, take care!
