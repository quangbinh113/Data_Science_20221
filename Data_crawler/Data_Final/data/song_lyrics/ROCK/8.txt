Song Name: EDGING
I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hanging me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp"
No way, no, I leave the broken-hearted
Oh, no, look at the mess we started
Oh, no, I leave the broken hearts this way
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only letting you down
They pursue me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control
Oh, no, I leave the broken-hearted
Oh, no, look at the mess we started
Oh, no, I leave the broken hearts this way
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?
Nightmare, daydream
You can't save me
No way, no, I leave the broken-hearted
Oh, no, look at the mess we started
Oh, no, I leave the broken hearts this way (shit!)
Oh, no, I leave the broken-hearted
Oh, no, look at the mess we started
Oh, no, I leave the broken hearts this way
Whatcha say? Every day it's a waste, wanna play?
