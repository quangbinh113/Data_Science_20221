Song Name: Girls of Summer
When winter hush turns summer pink
In half the time it takes to blink
But it all depends on what'choo think
About the girls of summer
When all you think of all day long
Is a pretty face inside a song
With a thought like that you can't go wrong
About the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (do you know... what everybody talkin' about)
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Over & over again
My favorite thing that drives me wild
Is when a city girl walks a country mile
For a boy she loves
God bless the child inside the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (do you know... what everybody talkin' about)
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Yeah... over & over again
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah
They get'choo climbin' the walls
They get'choo caught in their spell
They get'choo speakin' in tongues
Could this be heaven or hell
To fall in love twice a day
Is such a sweet place to be
S'il - vous - plait
The best things about life are free
The pussywillow up your tree
To the one who climbs
They'll always be the girl... yeah
Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls no doubt about it
Some girls are born to make you cry
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls got twenty reasons why
Over and over and over and over and over...
