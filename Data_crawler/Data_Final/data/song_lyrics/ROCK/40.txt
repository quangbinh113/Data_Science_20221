Song Name: Without Me
How did we let it all come to nothing? (Nothing)
Feeling like I should've been feeling something (something)
Lately, I've been puttin' it off to see if (to see if)
You'd come back crawling
The floor is falling out
So don't you hold me if you don't wanna know me
Don't you play dumb when I see what you run from
So don't you leave me empty when it's only in my eyes
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me, but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?
Call me when you know you're feeling lovesick (lovesick)
Or you can call it off when you see that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)
Lately, I've been putting it off to see you
Don't come back crawling
The floor is falling out
So don't you hold me if you don't wanna know me
Don't you play dumb
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me, but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?
So don't you hold me
If you don't wanna know me
So don't you leave me empty
When it's only in my eyes
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me, but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel?
How do you feel
Without me?
