Song Name: Space Between
Oo, ah, oo
We the people want our freedom but they're sticking it to us
Will someone shake me till they wake me up?
I've been somewhere in the middle of a nightmare and a dream
Uh uh, America's not what it seems
You're not ready for
You're not ready for me
To bring the change you say you wanna see
I'm not ready for
I'm not ready for you
To break the walls I built around my heart
I've been walking in the space between
(In between)
My heart and mind, and the things that I don't see
(I don't see)
Am I a ghost?
Will I come and go?
Or am I stuck in the space between?
Oo, ah, not going anywhere
Oo, ah, you stay right here
I hear the kids shouting for freedom
While both sides bang a gong
How long?
How long do we gotta sing this song?
Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters tearing me at the seams
I'm hoping that love can keep our unity
I'm not ready for
Still not ready for you
To bring the change we wanna see
I've been walking in the space between
(In between)
My heart and mind, and the things that I don't see
(I don't see)
Am I a ghost?
Will I come and go?
Or am I stuck in the space between?
They've been cashing the check
Lining their pockets
How long until we go free?
We're all stuck in the space between
I've been walking in the space between
My heart and mind, a higher plane that we can't see
I hear your ghost saying, "no we cannot walk alone"
I've been walking in the space between
(In between)
My heart and mind, and the things that I don't see
(I don't see)
Am I a ghost?
Will I come and go?
Or am I stuck in the space between?
Oo, ah, not going anywhere
Oo, ah, oo
