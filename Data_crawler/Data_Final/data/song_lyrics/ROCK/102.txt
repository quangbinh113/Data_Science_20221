Song Name: Vivien
You rise from the lakebed
Our bodies sank into
The lights from the highway
Were shining shapes on you
I saw you in the water clutching to my hand
Falling deep into your dripping heart again
Last night I found you wet (I found you wet)
I was dry, but you pulled me in
And we drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We knew when the wave hit
That all our fears were through
I go down with you all the way
Timeless in our tomb
I found you in the water, you were soaking wet
Falling deep into your dripping heart again
Last night I found you wet (I found you wet)
I was dry, but you pulled me in
And we drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We drowned in silence (go down with you again)
Last night I saw you wet (I saw you wet)
I was dry, you dragged me in
And we drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We drowned in silence (go down with you again)
I found you in the water, you were soaking wet
Falling deep into your dripping heart again
I saw you in the water clutching to my hand
Falling deep into your dripping eyes again
Again, again, again
Last night I found you wet (I found you wet)
I was dry, but you pulled me in
And we drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We drowned in silence (go down with you again)
Last night I saw you wet (I saw you wet)
I was dry, you dragged me in
And we drowned in silence (go down with you again)
We drowned in silence (go down with you again)
