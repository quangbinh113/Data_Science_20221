Song Name: Cinnamon
You've been playing with my mind
I always let you get the best of me
How can you be so unkind?
Yet taste so damn sweet
Now I'm not saying I'm addicted to you babe
But I've been craving you all week
Oh it burns when I touch you darling
So you got yourself between my eye and teeth
Oh-oh, I want your cinnamon hips
And the taste of your lips on mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, and I'm losing my grip 'cause I just can't resist
Your cinnamon
My innocence is on the line
And I'm waiting at the bed
'Cause every time I say I need you
You just turn around and call it quits honey
That's just how it is
Oh-oh, I want your cinnamon hips
And the taste of your lips on mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, and I'm losing my grip 'cause I just can't resist
Your cinnamon
Oh-oh, I want your cinnamon hips
Oh, and the taste of your, the taste of your lips on mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, and I'm losing my grip 'cause I just cannot resist
Your cinnamon
