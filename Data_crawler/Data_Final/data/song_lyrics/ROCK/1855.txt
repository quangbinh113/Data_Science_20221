Song Name: Swanee River
Well, John and Georgia never swanee
River keep on rollin' up far
You know I didn't roam million miles away
From where my mama let me run and play
That's where my heart is cryin', Johnny
I'll be good to keep on rockin' up
That's where my grandma and my grandpa stayed
All the whole world today, so mixed up
People want to hassle me
Everywhere I go, every place I roam
I'm going back
Where I've been up on the swanee and picked up
My mammy's little sharny
'Cause that's where I belong
That's my grandma and my grandpa's home
If I would've done this like the old folks told me
Instead I like I wanted
'Til I believe I'd be in better shape today
At least I would not have no house and
But I took off on a double
And caused my, self a lot of trouble
And now I got to boogie like my grandma and my grandpa say
I am better tryna fool with these phoney
People I've been known are now far
A far, too far for my own good
I don't wanna to get myself together and go back
When I'm up on the swanee
Walk up to the river and stand there
Where my grandma and my grandpa stood
All, the whole world today, so mixed up
People want to hassle you
Everywhere you go, everywhere you stay
I'm going back
Where I've been up on the swanee and picked up
My mammy's little sharny
'Cause that's where I belong
That's my grandma and my grandpa's home
