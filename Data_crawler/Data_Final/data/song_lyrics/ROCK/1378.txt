Song Name: Bold as Love
Anger!
He smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armour.
Queen jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground.
Blue are the life-giving waters, taken for granted,
They quietly understand.
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on.
But they're are all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident, that he flashes trophies of war
And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young and full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around.
My yellow in this case is not so mellow in fact I'm trying to say,
It's frightened like me, and all these emotions of mine
Keep holding me from giving my life to a rainbow like you,
But I'm a... yeah
I'm bold as love, yeah, yeah
Well I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking
I'm bold as love,
Just ask the axis, he knows everything.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
