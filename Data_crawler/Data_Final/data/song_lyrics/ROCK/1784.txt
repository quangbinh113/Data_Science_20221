Song Name: One of These Nights - 2013 Remaster
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out pretty mama
What turns on your lights?
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons, you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own
Ooh, someone to be kind to in between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the Devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight
Ooh, loneliness will blind you in between the wrong and the right
Oh-whoa-oh
Ooh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
(One of these nights)
Ooh, in between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
Get ya, baby, one of these nights
(One of these nights)
Hoo-hoo-hoo hoo-hoo-hoo
(One of these nights)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(One of these nights)
Coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you now
(One of these nights)
It gets so dark, so dark, and all alone
(One of these nights)
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
(One of these nights)
Swear I'm gonna find you, coming right behind you
(One of these nights)
Hoo-hoo-o-o-o-h
(One of these nights)
I wanna say aaah
(One of these nights)
One of these, one of these
(One of these nights)
Coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
(One of these nights...)
