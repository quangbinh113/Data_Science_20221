Song Name: Let's Twist Again
Come on everybody
Clap your hands
Aw, you're looking good
I'm goona sing my song
It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist and it goes like this
Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
And 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby make me know
You love me so, and then
Twist again
Like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Twist
Who's that, flyin up there
Is it a bird? (No)
Is it a plane? (No)
Is it the twister? (Yeah)
Twist again, like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
And 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby make me know
You love me so, and then
Come on, twist again
Like we did last summer
Let's twist again
Like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
