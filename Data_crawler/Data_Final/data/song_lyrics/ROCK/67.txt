Song Name: Faded Out (feat. Within Temptation)
I don't wanna wake up lately
The days are getting longer
It feels just like I'm going through the motions
And I don't know what's wrong with me
I wanna try, I wanna care
I wanna feel alive like I used to
I wanna be someone, do something
But it feels a little like sleepwalking
I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out
And it's not getting better
Give me something real to hold on to
'Cause I don't know what's real anymore
I'm walking through the haze tryna find you
The person that I was before
I gave it all, but I found a hole
That I didn't know was hiding
Thought I knew who I was, looks like I was wrong
And I've been out lost sleepwalking
I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out (lost myself, once again)
And it's not getting better
I wanna find some piece of mind
I need a lifeline, please somebody, please somebody
I can't seem to wake up
Something's gotta give 'fore I give up
I can't live like this
I hate everything I feel 'cause I don't feel anything anymore
And I don't know why
I just wanna stop time to catch my breath
I'm faded out (lost myself, once again)
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down (falling down)
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off? (Shake it off)
Is it not enough (not enough) to wanna get better?
I'm faded out (lost myself, once again)
And it's not getting better!
