Song Name: Dead Man Walking
I threw my phone out of the window, I'm so over it
Weight on my shoulders, every day another storm to live
I'm standing at the ledge
My foot's about to slide
What if it takes the fall for me to learn to fly
I try to run from what I've done
And it cost me everyone, all it left me was feeling numb
Sunrise stayed up 'til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I'm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don't pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain't no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking
Russian roulette, I swear I don't have many chances left
No I should change, but man I swear I'd rather dance with death
I'm just a desperate soul
Another broken human
I know some stars are falling
I know some stars are shooting
I get so high
I'm froze in time
Shattered pieces fell on the floor of a heart no longer pure
Sunrise stayed up 'til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I'm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don't pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain't no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking
Ain't no saving a-
(Dead man walking)
(A dead man walking)
(Dead man walking) I threw my phone out of the window I'm so over it
Weight on my shoulders every day another storm to live
Sunrise stayed up 'til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I'm locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don't pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain't no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking
Ain't no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking
