Song Name: Tonight
I saw my baby
She was turning blue
Oh, I knew that soon
Her young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said
Everything will be all right, tonight
Everything will be all right, tonight
No one moves, no one talks
No one thinks, no one walks, tonight
Everything will be all right, tonight
Everything will be all right, tonight
No one moves, no one talks
No one thinks, no one walks, tonight, tonight
I am gonna love her to the end
I am gonna love her to the end
I will love her 'til I die
I will see her in the sky, tonight
I will see her in the sky, tonight
I will see her in the sky, tonight
I will see her in the sky, tonight
I will see her in the sky, tonight
