Song Name: Hey, Hey, What Can I Do - Remaster
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
Ah, she's the only one that I been dreamin' of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love
I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true
Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standin' in line
I said they come to pray to the Lord
With my little girl, looks so fine
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around
Lookin' for my street corner girl
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind sharin' what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman and she won't be true
I said she won't be true, no
Yeah, no, yeah, no
Yeah, no, yeah, no (hey, hey, what can I say?)
Ah (hey, hey, what can I do)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
(No, no, what can I say?) she won't
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on (hey, hey, what can I do?)
(No, no, what can I say?)
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
(No, no, what can I say?)
Hey, hey what can I do
I got a woman, she won't be true
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, hear what I said
I got a woman, want to ball all day
(No, no, what can I say?) keep on, keep on
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
