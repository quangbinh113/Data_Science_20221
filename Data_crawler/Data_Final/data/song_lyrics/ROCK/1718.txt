Song Name: Gypsy
So I'm back to the velvet underground
Back to the floor that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was do the gypsy that I was...
Doo,doo-doo-doo
And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does when lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night...
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy
To the gypsy that remains faces freedom
With a little fear
I have no fear
I have only love
And if I was a child and the child was enough
Enough for me to love enough to love...
She is dancing away from you now
She was just a wish she was just a wish
And her memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy oh
You see your gypsy
Ooh,ooh,oh,oh,oh
Oh,oh,oh,oh

Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
Ooh,oh,oh,oh
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice
It all (Oh,oh,oh) comes down to you
I still see your your bright eyes bright eyes
It all comes down to you
