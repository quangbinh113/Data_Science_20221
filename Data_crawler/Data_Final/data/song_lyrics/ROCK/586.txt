Song Name: Kool Thing
Kool thing sittin' with a kiddie
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a chance here
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Kool thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Yeah, tell'em about it,
Hit'em where it hurts
Hey, kool thing, come here, sit down
There's something I go to ask you.
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is!
Huh?
Yeah!
Don't be shy
Word up!
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby!
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Come on, come on, come on, come on let everybody know
Kool thing, kool thing
When you're a star, I know you'll fix everything
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
