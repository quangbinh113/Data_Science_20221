Song Name: Baptism By Fire
Let's get the party started
And lemme do you tricks
Let's get the join jumpin'
The boys need their kicks
We're gonna shock the nation
Make em flip their lips
Get on you?
Oh, bring a lotta bottles and join the clip
I said ride ride ride, up all night
Ride, it'll blow yo mind
Baptism by the fire
Don't let me roll the tires
Baptism by the fire
You stir the fire rewindin'
Play yo hand, come on and make a stand
Feelin' the track of thunder
Or feel the lightning spike
Get in the? and fire?
It's lit for tools night
Ride ride ride, up all night
Ride, it'll blow yo mind
Baptism by the fire
Don't let me roll the tires
Baptism by the fire? burnin' wider
Baptism by the fire
Shootin' high and shootin'?
Play yo hand, come on and play yo hand
And let me show ya how
Come on and make a stand
It'll blow yo mind
Baptism by the fire
Sweet sweet desire
Baptism by the fire
You're gonna burn the wire
Baptism by the fire
Shootin' high and shootin'?
