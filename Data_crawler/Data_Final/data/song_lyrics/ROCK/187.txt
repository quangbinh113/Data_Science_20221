Song Name: Ringin' In My Head
People, people, your attention please
I need to tell all y'all about a new disease
It's crept right up from beneath our nose
And what happens next, we already know
You get a ringin' in your head
Your bones start shakin'
You got something needin' to be said
You got a ringin'
I got a ringin' in my head
My bones are shakin'
I got somethin' needin' be said
I can feel it in my chest
I got a ringin' in my head
The whole world's been shaken
By the time they find us dead
They got a ringin' in their heads
Brother, brother could you lend a hand
I'm in a prison in my own land
Enlist resistance with a peaceful heart
Can't let these times tear us all apart
I got a ringin' in my head
My bones are shakin'
I got somethin' needin' be said
I can feel it in my chest
I got a ringin' in my head
The whole world's been shaken
By the time they find us dead
They got a ringin' in their heads
You get a ringin' in your head
Your bones start shakin'
You got something needin' to be said
You got a ringin'
I got a ringin' in my head
My bones are shakin'
I got somethin' needin' be said
I can feel it in my chest
I got a ringin' in my head
The whole world's been shaken
By the time they find us dead
They got a ringin' in their heads
I got a ringin' in my head
My bones are shakin'
I got somethin' needin' be said
I can feel it in my chest
I got a ringin' in my head
The whole world's been shaken
By the time they find us dead
They got a ringin' in their heads
I got a ringin' in my head
My bones are shakin'
I got somethin' needin' be said
I can feel it in my chest
I got a ringin' in my head
The whole world's been shaken
By the time they find us dead
They got a ringin' in their heads
