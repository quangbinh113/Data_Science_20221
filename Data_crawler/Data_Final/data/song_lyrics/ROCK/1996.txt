Song Name: Paris Blues
I wish I was a girl of sixteen
Be the queen of the magazine
I'd drive around in a great big car
I'd see the world as a great big dream
All night long you could hear me scream
Hear me scream
When you look around
When you look all around you
Can you believe the shape she's in
Look all around you
Can you believe the shape she's in
Know where I'm goin'
Can't remember where I've been
Know right where I'm goin'
Well I can't remember where I've been
Goin' to the city of love
Gonna start my life all over again, yeah
Once I was young
Now I'm gettin' old
Once I was warm, babe
Now I feel cold
Well I'm goin' overseas
Gonna grab me some of that gold
