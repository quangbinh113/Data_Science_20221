Song Name: Take What You Want
Love's complicated, love it or hate it
I'm in this to win
You don't have to believe it, take it or leave it
Just let it begin
From two different worlds we come crashing in
It's like a brand new day (ooh-ooh)
Stand shoulder to shoulder, soldier to soldier
So show me the way
Take what you want, take what you need
Take anything, but just leave some for me
So take what you like if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free
Life is elective, the unexpected
It's part of the deal
Don't try to move me, this ain't like a movie
This ending is real
From two different worlds we come crashing in
It's like a perfect storm (ooh-ooh)
Stand shoulder to shoulder, soldier to soldier
So just bring it on
So take what you want, take what you need
Take anything, but just leave some for me
So take what you like if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free
All alone, return to stone
As the king is overthrown
The truth begins to shine
And it's mine for now and forever
So take what you want, take what you need
Take anything, but just leave some for me
So take what you like if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
