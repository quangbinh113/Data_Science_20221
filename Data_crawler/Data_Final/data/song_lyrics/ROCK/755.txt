Song Name: Here I Go Again - 2018 Remaster
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I sure know where I've been
Hangin' on the promises in songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wastin' no more time
Here I go again

Here I go again
Though I keep searchin' for an answer
I never did I find what I'm lookin' for
Ooh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
But I've made up my mind
I ain't wastin' no more time
I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waitin' on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wastin' no more time
But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again

Here I go
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wastin' no more time
And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
