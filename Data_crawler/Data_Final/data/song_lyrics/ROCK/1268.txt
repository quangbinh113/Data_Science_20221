Song Name: Stone Cold Crazy - Remastered 2011
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outta town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Woo
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Aww, get 'em all
Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet with my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and get at me
I gotta give it, get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Ow
