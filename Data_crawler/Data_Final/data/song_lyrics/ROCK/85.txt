Song Name: Worst Is On Its Way
Look out, tell me this is nothing
Something's playing tricks and it's chipping away
I kept swirling is the trouble
Disguised in the paces, they're blocking my way
Calling me
I feel it coursing through the inside
And I can't get away, away inside
I feel it breathing and I realize
The worst is on its way
It is always something
Life keeps throwing things that don't go my way
I'm damned, awful thoughts devour me
All familiar places I can't escape
Calling me
I feel it coursing through the inside
And I can't get away, away inside
I feel it breathing and I realize
The worst is on its way

It makes me sick
But I deal with it
Set it all aside
My confidence overrides
Calling me
I feel it coursing through the inside
Calling me
I feel it coursing through the inside
And I can't get away, away inside
I feel it breathing and I realize
The worst is on its way
The worst is on its way
The worst is on its way
It makes me sick
But I deal with it
Set it all aside
My confidence overrides
