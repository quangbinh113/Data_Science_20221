Song Name: We Want the Airwaves - 2002 Remaster
Nine to five and five to nine
Ain't gonna take it, it's our time
We want the world and we want it now
We're gonna take it anyhow
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Well, let's rock
Tonight, all night
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Well, let's rock
Tonight, all night, all night
Where's your guts and will to survive?
Don't you wanna keep rock 'n' roll music alive?
Mr. Programmer, I got my hammer
For to smash my, smash my radio
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Let's rock
Tonight, all night
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Let's rock
Tonight, all night, all night
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
