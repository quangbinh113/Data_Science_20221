Song Name: Realize
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
The moment you realize
Those moments just pass you by
Gonna take you to paradise
Move it
Make you prove it, yeah
Breakin' out
Break it down
Feel the chill, feel the chill
Movin' down your spine
When we recall and realize
Make you realize
I've got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
And your eyes playin' tricks on you
And your mind will seek the truth
You know you're gonna make it through
I said, move it
Make you prove it
Shake it out
Shake it down
Feel the chill, feel the chill
Movin' down your spine

When we recall and realize, hey yeah
Gonna make you realize

I got the power to electrify
Make or break or satisfy
And feel a chill up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
Fly, fly
When we recall and realize
Gonna make you realize

I got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
