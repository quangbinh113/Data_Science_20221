Song Name: Sheena Is a Punk Rocker - 2017 Remaster
Go
Well, the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now
They got their surfboards and they're going to the Discotheque a Go Go
But she just couldn't stay
She had to break away
Well, New York City really has it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Well, she's a punk-punk, a punk rocker
Punk-punk, a punk rocker, ooh
Punk-punk, a punk rocker
Punk-punk, a punk rocker
Well, the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now
They got their surfboards 'cause they're going to the Discotheque a Go Go
But she just couldn't stay
She had to break away
Well, New York City really has it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Well, she's a punk-punk, a punk rocker
Punk-punk, a punk rocker, ooh
Punk-punk, a punk rocker
Punk-punk, a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
