Song Name: Sympathy For The Devil - 50th Anniversary Edition
Yeow - Yeow - Yeow
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul an faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out
Who killed the Kennedy's
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah
Ah get down, baby
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo)
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you
Is just the nature of my game, mm yeah
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politeness
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, mm mean it
Get down
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
(Woo-woo, woo-woo)
Woo-who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Ah yeah
Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooh-who
