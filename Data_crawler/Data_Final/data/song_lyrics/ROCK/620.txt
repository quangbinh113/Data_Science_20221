Song Name: Do You See Me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Find out what my heart needs
My desires – my dreams
Won't promise you anything
Life has its own ways
I'll always stand my ground
Though I sometimes lose control
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Do you feel discomfort
When you see my pain
Are you feeling frightened
Am I pushing you away
All you see in my eyes
Is who I really am
Take a look inside me
It's the soul of a man
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
Come on, come on, come on
Do you see me
When you look into my eyes
What do you see
When you look into my eyes
What do you see
When you look into my eyes
What do you see
When you look into my eyes
Do you know – now is the time
Do you know- here is the place
There is nothing left to hide
So let's lose our poker face
Will we see each other
Allow us to be free
With our miracle souls
I see you and you see me
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me
When you look into my eyes
What do you see(I'm here)
When you look into my eyes
What do you see(I'm here)
When you look into my eyes
What do you see(I'm here)
When you look into my eyes
What do you see(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
Come on - come on - come on
Do you see me(I'm here)
I'm here
I'm here
Do you see me
