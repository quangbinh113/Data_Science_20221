Song Name: Hammer To Fall - Remastered 2011
Hey hey hey hey, "Hammer to Fall"!
Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all, yeah
And it's time for the hammer to fall
Every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build up...
Tow your line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain, oh, yeah
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it's time for the hammer to, hammer to fall
It's going to fall!
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
One more time
Waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time!
