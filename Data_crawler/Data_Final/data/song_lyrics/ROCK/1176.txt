Song Name: She Is Love
When the sunshine beckons to ya
And your wings begin to unfold
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
Are gonna keep me from the cold
And if the sword is hidden among ya
And its words may wound my soul
You can fill me up with what you got
'Cause my heart's been keeping old
She is love
And the ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
You had all my thoughts of passion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
Well, you keep it warm at night
I don't know where you come from
And no, I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love with someone who loves me too
She is love
And the ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
She is love
And the ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
