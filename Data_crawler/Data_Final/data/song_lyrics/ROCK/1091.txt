Song Name: Waiting On A Friend - Remastered 2009
Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense
Out of these girls passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on friend
Mmm a smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Ooh don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Ooh making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
