Song Name: It Simply Isn't Christmas...
You'll find I'm free on the 25th
Now it doesn't mean a thing
Your exit caused my world to shift
When you took off your ring
The holidays were the special time
I always spent with you
I can't go on like life's sublime
Look what you made me do
I'm not listening to no carolers singing
I can't bear all of those sleigh bells jingling
Don't wish me Merry Christmas
While I'm sinkin' into a deep abyss
Yeah I've exed X-mas off my list to do
Cos it simply isn't Christmas without you
No frantic shopping in the mall
I've avoided every store
I'm not decking any halls
Til you walk in the door
I heard Mistletoe's a parasite
Like my friends all said of you
I'm tangled up like Christmas lights
You turned my yuletide blue
I don't wanna build a snowman - no man
I just had to let it go
You know for me there's only one man - one man
With whom I'd frolic in the snow
No rockin' round my Christmas tree
No tinsel shinin' bright
This year it isn't meant for me
I just have silent nights
That Santa's just a sharp dressed man
Who needs to watch the carbs
But I could be his biggest fan
If he'll put you in my arms
I'm not listening to no carolers singin
I can't bear all those sleigh bells jinglin
Don't wish me a Merry Christmas
While I'm sinkin' into a deep abyss
Yeah I've exed X-mas off my list to do
Cos it simply isn't Christmas without you
Cos it simply isn't Christmas without you
