Oh, well, oh, well, I feel so good today (uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
We just touched ground on an international runway (uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
Jet propelled back home, from overseas to the U.S.A. (oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
New York, Los Angeles, oh, how I yearned for you (uh-huh-huh, mm-huh)

Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway? (Uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
From the coast of California to the shores of Delaware Bay (uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
You can bet your life I did, till I got back in the U.S.A. (oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

Lookin' hard for a drive-in, searching for a corner caf√© (uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day (uh-huh-huh, oh, yeah)
Yeah, and the juke-box jumping with records like in the U.S.A. (oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Well, I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A. (uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yes, I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A. (uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Anything you want, they got right here in the U.S.A. (mm-huh, mm-huh)
I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A. (mm-huh, mm-huh)
