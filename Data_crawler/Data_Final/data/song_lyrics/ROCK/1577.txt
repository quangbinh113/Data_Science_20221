Song Name: Havana Affair - 2016 Remaster
PT Boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a livin' man pickin' the banana
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray! for the U.S.A
Baby, baby, make me loco
Baby, baby, make me mambo
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop Havana go-go
I used to make a living man pickin' the banana
Hooray! for Havana
Baby, baby, make me loco
Baby, baby, make me mambo
PT Boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a livin' man pickin' the banana
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray! for the U.S.A
Baby, baby, make me loco
Baby, baby, make me mambo
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop Havana go-go
I used to make a living man pickin' the banana
Hooray! for Havana
Baby, baby, make me loco
Baby, baby, make me mambo
