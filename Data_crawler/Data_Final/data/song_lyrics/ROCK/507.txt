Song Name: Edge of Seventeen - 2016 Remaster
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooo, baby, ooo
And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, (everything's not)
Baby, nothin' else mattered
He was no more, than a baby then
Well he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of, seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
"Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Said "Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, well, the music there
Well it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody, nothing else mattered
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
"Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Said "Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colours, but the sea
Does not change
And so with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age old desire to please
On the edge of, seventeen
Ooooooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
"Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
"Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standing in the hall, yeah yeah
Well in a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard her fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird, singing "Come away" (Come away)
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooo, baby, ooo
Said "Ooo"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
"Ooo, baby, ooo"
Said "Ooo"
Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
Sometime to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
(I'm a few years older than you) my love
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooo, baby, ooo
Said "Ooo"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooo, baby, ooo
Said "Ooo"
