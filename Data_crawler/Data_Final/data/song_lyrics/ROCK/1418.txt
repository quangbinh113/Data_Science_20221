Song Name: Riders On The Storm - Fredwreck Remix
Hey yo Jim man
Why don't ya
You don't you kick some of that
You know, you know how you do it man
It's a trip people don't even believe were together right now (wow)
But tell your story, man
You know the one I like
Say it for me (Ride, ride, ride)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Into this house we're born (Into this house we're born)
Into this world we're thrown (Into this world we're thrown)
Like a dog without a bone (Like a dog without a bone)
An actor out on loan(An actor out alone)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
There's a killer on the road (Killer, Murder)
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday (holidays, holidays)
Let your children play (play)
If ya give this man a ride
Sweet family will die (Die)
Killer on the road, yeah (Killer, Murder)
Goin' off of this roll off of that with the Lizard king
Bumpin' in the back (wow) how bout that (yeah)
Driftin', Liftin', Swiftin', coastin', Testaroastin'
But the wheels won't stop 200 (errrr) on the highway fresh
Up off the block he's a rider, na he's a killer dresses in all black
But his hat says Stella (Stella)
Pedal to the metal I gotta go hard
Drive by and say hello hey Fredwreck you my mello now let me
Hear what I sound like acapella (shhh) wow ride dip swish now
Bring it back just like this like a dog with out his bone unlike
A G with out his chrome it's hard to imagine the homey dog in a
Jag and he's checkin' for the checkered flag comin' in first never
In last cause my car to fast (zoom, zoom) I neva eva run out of
Gas cause I just to clean I do it upper class so fasten your seat
Belts it's so hot it will even make heat melt (woo, woo) so get a bowl
And roll and ride slip through the slip and slide
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If ya give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah
Away chameleon
Need for speed I'm trying to take the lead hold on little homey
Before you run into the trees
I've seen things that
I would have never saw before hey yo Jim let'em in, let'em in open up
My back tire smokin' (errrr) the whole street and now the police wanna
Flash there lights and chase the Dogg
All night (woof) but I won't pull over
Nor give up, 'cause I just don't give a fuck (What, What, What)
Yeah from the side boy where we was
Born and raised straight up to ride
Boy (west side) continuously
(Continuously) we get to it expeditiously
Keep the light on east side on Snoop Dogg and The Doors
And yeah we bout to ride on
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
And let's ride
