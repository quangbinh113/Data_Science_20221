Song Name: Circles
Oh, native tongues, their talking
Bliss, tragedy, divine
I set to search the ruins
I looked inward to find
I keep running into circles
I keep running into circles
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find myself
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find myself
There is a land of enchantment
If I would just close my eyes
We were walking in slow motion
The Greater Spirit and I
He told me with no words
We're all looking for something
That's already here
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find myself
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find my own
Yeah
Are we all looking for someone
To see us for who we really are? We are
Because as long as we know ourselves
No one could ever get that far
I keep running into circles
I keep running into circles
I keep running into circles
I keep running into circles
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find myself
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find my own
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find myself
Lost myself to find me
Left him there to just bleed
Running into circles to find my own
Lost myself to-
(Into circles)
(Into circles)
