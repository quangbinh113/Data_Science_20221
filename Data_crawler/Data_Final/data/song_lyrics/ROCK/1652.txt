Song Name: We are the Clash
Punk rockers, hip hoppers
Pill poppers, show stoppers
Be boppers, hair droppers
Are you ready to sing?
Right wing, left wing
I want something
To see me through the siege
About what you think
We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing:
We are The Clash! - what?
We are The Clash! - louder!
Let's strike a match, you can spill the gas!
With my guitar now
[...] stance
I've seen them when they'd beat upon
How the injuries stay
Beating on your drum
Did they tell them 'take it in'
Got the nervous sort of feeling
Where the fat boy blew
We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing:
We are The Clash!
We are The Clash!
Let's strike a match, you can spill the gas! - Gasoline!
Home fires burning
In motorcycle city
The Rocking God will choose
If I'm being released (rock, rock, Clash city rockers!)
The first [...]
In jail at 46
And there ain't no [...]
To give and take respect
We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing:
We are The Clash! - Don't take no shit
We are The Clash! - Do you hear me?
Let's strike a match, you can spill the gas!
