Song Name: Slaughter Beach
I'm not sweating any consequences
I do what I have to do just to get on by
There's no sex appeal in guilt nor anger
Ain't it enough, ain't it enough to provide?
Economic casualties
My blue-blooded creeps
Hand in hand, we walk together
Along Slaughter Beach
Maritime tragedies
You blue-blooded freaks
Hand in hand, we walk together
Along Slaughter Beach
I'm not betting on wild horses
Like they do in Assateague or Pimlico
I demand to shuck my clam the old-fashioned way
Under a strawberry moon, bare-handed, wearing no clothes
Economic casualties
My blue-blooded creeps
Hand in hand, we walk together
Along Slaughter Beach
Maritime tragedies
You blue-blooded freaks
Hand in hand, we walk together
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Economic casualties
My blue-blooded creeps
Hand in hand, we walk together
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Maritime tragedies
You blue-blooded freaks
Hand in hand, we walk together
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
Sunrise on Slaughter Beach
