Song Name: 10:15 Saturday Night
10:15 on a Saturday night
And the tap
Drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip-
Waiting for the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering where she's been
And I'm crying for yesterday
And the tap drips
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip-
