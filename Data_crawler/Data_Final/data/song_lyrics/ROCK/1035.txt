Song Name: King Of The Night Time World
It's so sad, living at home
Far from the city and the midnight fun
It's so bad, going to school
So far from me and the dirty things that we do
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream
It's so fine, loving with ease
Far from the house and the family fights
It's so fine, being with you
Being with me makes everything alright
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream, alright!
It's so sad, you're not content
Far from the music and the neon glow
Ain't you glad we got the time
Far from our folks? They'll never ever know
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream
I'm the king of the nighttime world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the nighttime world
Come live your secret dream
I'm the king of the nighttime world
