Song Name: Oh No Not You Again - Remastered
Let me tell you 'bout two young lovers that lived on the coast
She was such a pretty thing and man, what a host
Come evening time, she sets the table for four
Some friend's are comin' round tonight
He's out on the town, he's trying to score
Woke up early this morning something's on his mind
Cursin' the night before, breakfast at nine
You know, she felt him restless, oh, all through the night
She senses something's wrong with him
She don't want to pry, she just wants to know why
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Don't own no swimming pool, not even a colour T.V
He works awful hard some day's and she lets him be
You know, things ain't looking good for them, no love no more
Some friend's are comin' round tonight
He's out on the town, knockin' on the wrong door
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
(He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, yeah)
Let me tell you 'bout two young lovers that lived on the coast
She was such a pretty thing and man, what a host
Come evening time, she sets the table for four
Some friends are comin' 'round tonight
He's out on the town, he's trying to score
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
(He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
(You again, again, again, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
(Baby, baby, baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
(You again now, baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, not you again
