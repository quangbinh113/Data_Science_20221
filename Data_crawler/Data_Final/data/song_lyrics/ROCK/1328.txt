Song Name: Over the Hills and Far Away - Remaster
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much
So much
So much
Many times I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed
Along the open road
Many times I've lied
Many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know
Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold
Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many many men
Can't see the open road
Many is a word
That only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing
You really ought to know, ooh
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
Oooh, you know I should
You know I should
You know I should
