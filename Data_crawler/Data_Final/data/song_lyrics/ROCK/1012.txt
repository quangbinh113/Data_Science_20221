Song Name: Shock Me
Your lightning's all I need
My satisfaction grows
You make me feel at ease
You even make me glow
Don't cut the power on me
I'm feelin' low, so get me high
Shock me, make me feel better

Shock me, put on your black leather

Shock me, we can come together
And baby, if you do what you've been told
My insulation's gone, girl you make me overload
Don't pull the plug on me, no, no
Keep it in and keep me high
Shock me, make me feel better

Shock me, put on your black leather

Shock me, we can come together
Come on
Shock me, baby
Shock me, oh yeah
Shock me, baby
Shock me, oh yeah
Shock me, make me feel better, oh yeah
Come on and shock me, put on your black leather
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire
Shock me, we can come together, oh yeah
I wanna feel your power
Shock me, make me feel better
Oh yeah, I'm down to the bare wire
Shock me, put on your black leather
Baby, come on, come on, shock me
