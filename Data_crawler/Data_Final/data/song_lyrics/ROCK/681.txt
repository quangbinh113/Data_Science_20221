Song Name: Running from the Storm
You're laying down all the rules
Now tell me how to win
And you played us all for fools
Now you're running from the ring
How's your form?
Running from the storm
Since you were born
Running from the storm
Undercover
Face in the dirt
Who's gonna catch you?
Who'll be the first?
Now one day, someday soon
I know you'll pay your bills
And to see you fork it out
It'll give us all a thrill
How's your form?
Running from the storm, from the storm
Since you were born
Running from the storm
Undercover
Face in the dirt
Who's gonna catch you?
Who'll be the first?
Undercover
Your face in the dirt
Who's gonna catch you?
Running from the storm
Since you were born
You've been running from the storm
