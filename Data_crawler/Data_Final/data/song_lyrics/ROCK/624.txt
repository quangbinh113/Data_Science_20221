Song Name: Rock And Roll Music
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock on music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
