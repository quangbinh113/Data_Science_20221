Song Name: Misty
Searching for an answer
Wandering through different place
Is there anything left for the heart so true?
Flying with broken wings
Plunging into certain death
The sight of you saves me from the fall
I reach out to touch you
Spread my wings towards your heart
Fly until I reach, reach my destination
Will I ever win?
Your voice answer to my doubts
Failure does not exist, EXIST, exist in my life
You, hope lies in your spark
Like candles in the dark
Guide me with your heart
You, caught me by suprise
Blink of your eyes
Light the colour in the sky
Happy ever after
Million hands grab me away from you
Million reasons nothing, NOTHING!
I ever knew, will it ever matter?
Fantasy turns to shattered dreams
I don't know why they stop me, hate me
What have i done?
Sadness in my eyes
Even demons cry
I wait for you
There's nothing I can do
Even back to where I start
Broken wings with broken heart
