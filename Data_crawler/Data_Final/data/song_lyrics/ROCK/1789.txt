Song Name: The Best of My Love - 2013 Remaster
Every night, I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We tried to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces and loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold, dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today?
You see it your way, and I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, oh, oh, but here in my heart

I give you the best of my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling

You get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh,sweet darling
Every night and day
You get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
Oh-oh, oh-oh, you get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
Mm, mm, mm, mm
You get the best of my love (The best of my love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet darling
You get the, you get the
You get the best of my love
