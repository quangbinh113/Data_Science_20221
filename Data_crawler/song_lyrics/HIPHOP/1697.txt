Song Name: Meet The Walkers 2 (With Nardo Wick)
Meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me then I—, uh
If you walkin' with—
We're disputin'
Slatt, come meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me, then
I talk 'em
See, he wanna be me, but that boy an
Impostor, he broke
Just watch how I walk on this beat and I float
Lil Double can get on that bitch and go crazy
Then slow shit down and go fast, don't play
No more
Fuck about no rapper, still, a trapper, slangin'
Them pounds of dope
Just had called my phone, said
He need him a wakeup
Halftime, we got the block on
So' told my nigga to handle the ways, if
The opps come back
Then we gotta go get him some more
Pull up, just clappin'
I don't give a fuck who out therе
Nigga, they all gotta go
Ayo
Beezy, get nasty, ate the man up in traffic
They don't give a fuck if they have any money
I'm havin' my way with these hoes
Let's go, he covered, he duckin' he pluck 'bout a ho'
All these hoes, they be slitherin', they
Fuckin' with blicky's
I'm way far from a kid, but I still wanna cuddle a bitch
If you said what she did with me, boy, you'd be sick
Kissin' a ho', wifin' the bitch
Nigga found out his ho' was fuckin', now he mad
Bigger than a bitch
Since he wanna fight, let him fight the switch
Keyboard typin', rat us in a blitz (Get out)
Niggas ain't tryna do nothin' but shoot a house up
How the fuck you steppin' on shit?
Niggas ain't doin' shit, but tryna get they clout up
Whole time, I'm ready to blitz 'em
Face-shot gang, the opps gon' miss 'em
Make your mom feel pain, 'cause she gon' kiss him
Slatt, come meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me, then
I talk 'em
See, he wanna be me, but that boy an impostor, he broke
Just watch how I walk on this beat and I float
Lil Double can get on that bitch and go crazy
Then slow shit down and go fast, don't play no more
Fuck about no rapper, still a trapper, slangin'
Them pounds of dope
Slatt, come meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me, then
I talk 'em
See, he wanna be me, but that boy an
Impostor, he broke
Just watch how I walk on this beat and I float
Lil Double can get on that bitch and go crazy
Then slow shit down and go fast, don't play
No more
Fuck about no rapper, still a trapper, slangin'
Them pounds of dope
I keep extensions, that glicky get jiggy, one
End off my hippy
Want smoke? I'ma blow, like a hippie (Grrah)
I came for your life, I'ma leave with a witness
(Grrah, grrah, grrah)
This is a Glock, but
This box on the back is no longer
A semi (Grr)
Aim it at you, I pull it one time and you
No longer livin'
I pull up with Double R, shot him two times
In the back
Now his shirt got a juggler (Shirt got a juggler)
What is the hostin' for? Walkin' and rhymin'
I got the Glock under my underclothes
(Grrah, grrah, grrah)
He tried to jump on them grind signs
Hold the stick up while I'm shootin' it at the flow
These niggas greener than Piccolo
My bitch, she yellow, like Pikachu, reach
For my neck and it's
Doo-doo-doo
Diamonds on me look like
Fruity Loops, big with the chopper, no
Fruity Loops
I came for all of that revenue, please give it up, like
A quitter do
Hands in the sky, like a center, do, I
Don't care what you was finna do
If I leave it messy, my bro move the waist, like
He hula hoop
You and your dawg servin' crimes, Scoob, Scoob, Scoob
Scooby-Doo (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
Slatt, come meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me, then
I talk 'em
See, he wanna be me, but that boy an
Impostor, he broke
Just watch how I walk on this beat and I float
Lil Double can get on that bitch and go crazy
Then slow shit down and go fast, don't play no more
Fuck about no rapper, still a trapper, slangin'
Them pounds of dope
Slatt, come meet the Walkers, if you movin' like me, then

See, he wanna be me, but that boy an
Impostor, he broke
