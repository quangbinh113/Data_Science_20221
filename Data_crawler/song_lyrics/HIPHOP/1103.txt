Song Name: Praise The Lord (Da Shine) (feat. Skepta)
Get it
Text message I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but I'm never hurting nothing
Even then, y'all don't worry none
And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan
And shoutout to my niggas with escape plans, uh
20 bands, rain dance
We can keep the rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
Yeah
I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)
I listened to X, I'm peak, the bars (yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine (woo)
To shine (woo), to shine (woo), to shine (woo), to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze (squeeze)
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
She came, I came now what's my name
My chain (woo), my pants (woo), my pants with the chain (woo)
They know it's me (woo), the hat and the shades (woo)
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage (what?)
My vans, my braids (what?)
My mans, my babe (what?)
My girls, my ex (what?)
My hoes that I left (what?)
The way that I stepped out the car that's a flex (what?)
Give thanks, get fresh (what?)
Praise the Lord then finesse (what?)
Bless
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw
I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
