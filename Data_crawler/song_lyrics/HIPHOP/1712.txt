Song Name: I Want You (with Future)
Uh, what you want?
Like, what you want?
(This a Kashflow production)
Uh, like what you want?
Uh
(Run it back Playboi)
We need beams and Yerc', you scared to turn it up, nigga, go to church
I ain't bougie, I'll take some bubba plate just for a verse
I just spot the whole 'nother nigga bitch, like his and hers
Before I ever bought a foreign, my mind was set on gettin' a 'Vert
Ol' cappin' ass nigga, stop buyin' that girl Tory Burch
Say you ran it up while you was on the slab and put in work
Got that girl all out of seas, why you ain't Gucci her?
Fuck 'round killed her off that Strong Back, now, she say her coochie hurt
I don't be rollin' with none of these hoes, I swear to God, I'm just a flirt
When them bows come in, we get 'em gone, we handle business first
Told my girl it's her world, but, she still walkin' on my Earth
Told that bitch I ain't her nigga, she can pick whatever purse
Gotta know that I'm that nigga, you can tell just by my shirt
Before I got some racks, I ain't have no life, I was posted on the curb
Tryna make a serve
Only thing a nigga want is a bird
Sippin' heavy syrup, that why when I talk my words slur
I want you
A nigga want you
I want you
And I need you
I want you
Tryna spoil you
You my girl
And I want you
We need beams and Yerc', you scared to turn it up, nigga go to church
I ain't bougie, I'll take some bubba plate just for a verse
I just spot the whole 'nother nigga bitch, like his and hers
Before I ever bought a foreign, my mind was set on gettin' a 'Vert
Ol' cappin' ass nigga, stop buyin' that girl Tory Burch
Say you ran it up while you was on the slab and put in work
Got that girl all out of seas, why you ain't Gucci her?
Fuck 'round killed her off that Strong Back, now, she say her coochie hurt (pluto, pluto)
Ol' cappin' ass nigga, you ain't never been on no heist
If I wasn't rappin', I'd be trappin', sellin' dope, still puttin' on ice
Got my Prada mask on, fuckin' yo' bitch, free Pooh Shiesty (Slatt)
Drippin' Gucci on my ho, splashin' Pucci on my wife
Niggas gettin' they nose wiped
I'm in the club with two pipes
I been takin' drugs, lookin' like a plug, high as a kite
They gon' charge a nigga for manslaughter just for how I be dressin' (pluto)
Had to fuck this nigga bitch, owe me money, think he finessin'
And I know my dawg ain't no ho, they go hell when they stretch him
I'm a boss and that's for sure, put my main bitch in baguette
A bougie bitch, I'ma a street nigga, treat her like she nothin'
Makin' moves this nigga makin' money rain like confetti
We need beams and Yerc', you scared to turn it up, nigga, go to church
I ain't bougie, I'll take some bubba plate just for a verse
I just spot the whole 'nother nigga bitch, like his and hers
Before I ever bought a foreign, my mind was set on gettin' a 'Vert
Ol' cappin' ass nigga, stop buyin' that girl Tory Burch
Say you ran it up while you was on the slab, been putting work
Got that girl all out of seas, why you ain't Gucci her?
Fuck 'round killed her off that Strong Back, now, she say her coochie hurt
I want you
Ain't tryna bore you
I'm for you
I want to
I'm on you 'cause I want you
I get home, put you down in Marni
I get home, put you down in Marni
Heard you're on me, I kept throwing money
Heard they're on me, I keep that chopper on reach (on me)
That's that dome piece, I kept that on, on me
