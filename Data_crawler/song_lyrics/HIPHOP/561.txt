Song Name: CAN'T SAY
No you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12, 'round my town you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim
You cop it live, boy I got in on film
You gotta watch out where you rock 'cause shit get real
Drink too real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel
Gotta take a long drive up the hill
Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals
I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft
Chicago baby, she just wanna drill
The vibes so wavy, it's too hard to kill
Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real
Uh-huh, yeah
Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop-pop my trunk, dip, dip, dip, dip
Oh my
You can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it burning out?
I let it burn, skrt that mark, I had to dip
Better watch for 12, 'round my town you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim
You cop it live, boy, I got in on film
Must be cautious, told the lil' hoes I'm all in
Play this ballers offense, I left ol' girl, she callin'
You know I hit in the mornin', oh yeah, she yawnin'
I met you in the club, bitch you know this shit be nothin'
Oh, didn't I hit you cousin? Mhm, no no discussion
Sippin' on lean, no Robotussin
Oh, yeah I know you love me, I beat it ain't no cuddlin'
You down bad, you sufferin'
I don't give a fuck how hard it get
That lil' bitch know I started this
Uh huh, oh yeah
Get to the cash, no lay-up
Spend a bitch bag, Rodeo
Some may ride for the fresh cut
Hoes come through just to touch us
I'ma tell the truth like Usher
You already know how I bust her
Slang my chop from Russia
Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop-pop my trunk, dip, dip, dip, dip
Swang-swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop-pop my trunk, dip
No you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip
Gotta watch for 12, 'round my town you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim
You cop it live, boy, I got in on film
