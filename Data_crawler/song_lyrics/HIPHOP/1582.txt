Song Name: Ghost
(Any last words?)
Uh
(D-Roc)
That's a hunnid, girl (Hunnid), did that money flow?
I was broke before, woah, woah
Put up with that shit with her, I don't really know
She like my foreign car, Rolls, Mr. Froze
Pull up all white, lookin' like I caught the holy ghost
Baby, this a Cullinan, this is not no Ghost (Ghost)
She told me that she like me, and say I'm her ghost (Ghost)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, I just sing to you
I got too much fluid, I'm drippin' when I come through it, woah, woah
Swerve in the foreign, that's a Rolls, woah
And that bitch cocaine snow
She the same color, bankroll rainbow (bankroll)
She want me to come up with it
She don't care about if my money run out
Tryna bang me something
Heard he say my name, he stuntin'
I can't wait until the day wе burn him
And the Nawf was home
Broad day, I go through the window, comin' out that housе with somethin'
Baby, I was broke
Now I don't know a hot summer
I don't know a cold winter (I don't know)
My desire adapted with my money
I just did it again, I just stepped on 'em (On it, I'm on 'em)
I got them hunnids from way back then
Put on that jersey, on back, it say "Kemp"
Swerve in that 'Burban with burners on him
I had to wire a fifty to her
I got them gunners on top of the rim
Know that they all gon' dunk on something, dump at somethin'
Slide in the Maybach, stuntin', countin' up big rack hunnids, oh-oh
I shoot the gun at them niggas
They already know how I'm comin'
I got the M&Ms
Versace, my nigga'nem
I wanna take me a jet out to London (Oh, oh)
Carat the diamond and everyone pointers
And you niggas ain't on nothin', yeah
That's a hunnid, girl (Hunnid), did that money flow?
I was broke before, woah, woah
Put up with that shit with her, I don't really know
She like my foreign car, Rolls, Mr. Froze
Pull up all white, lookin' like I caught the holy ghost
Baby, this a Cullinan, this is not no Ghost (Ghost)
She told me that she like me, and say I'm her ghost (Ghost)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, I just sing to you
I got too much fluid, I'm drippin' when I come through it, woah, woah
Swerve in the foreign, that's a Rolls, woah
And that bitch cocaine snow
She the same color, bankroll rainbow (bankroll)
She want me to come up with it
She don't care about if my money run out
