Song Name: Feel so Good
You ready Mase?
Party people
In the place to be (uh huh)
It's about that time
For us to (yeah, uh huh)
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up
Ride true, a bigger truck
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?
Jig with it, cuz, ship crisp, split it all
- Ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your -
Lighting up drugs, always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, b- in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good (bad boy)
You know, you make me feel so good (yeah)
You know, you make me feel so good (that's all we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (c'mon)
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (eh, eh, c'mon)
You can't understand we be, Waikiki
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's, they wanna be me
- Talkin' - they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just stylishing cars 'cause they all true Nig'
So while you daydream, my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with - that pose in Maybelline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy bought (that's right)
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money (c'mon now)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good (c'mon now)
You know, you make me feel so good (yeah)
You know, you make me feel so good (that's all we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (c'mon)
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (c'mon)
I wouldn't change you if I could (eh, eh)
Do Mase got the ladies? (Yeah, yeah)
Do Puff drive Mercedes? (Yeah, yeah)
Take hits from the 80's? (Yeah, yeah)
But do it sound so crazy? (Yeah, yeah)
Well me personally, it's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ass cat
Where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly (that's right)
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to m√©nage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' - from girls that used to hardly speak (c'mon)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good (uh, uh)
You know, you make me feel so good (bad boy)
You know, you make me feel so good (that's all we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (c'mon)
I wouldn't change you if I could (let's go)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good (uh huh)
You know, you make me feel so good
You know, you make me feel so good (c'mon)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (don't stop)
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Mase, Harlem World)
