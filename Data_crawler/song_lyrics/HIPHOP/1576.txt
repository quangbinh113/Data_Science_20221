Song Name: My Dawg (with Lil Durk)
You my dawg
And you my dawg
You my dawg
You my dawg
Told you that I got, you my dawg forever
I know you broken and you tryna keep your shit together
Pull up on me, I can get some bands together (pull up, bands)
Right or wrong, I told you that I'm down, whatever (whatever)
My girl a brat, I'm not a rat, I don't fight over cheddar (no way)
Leave the key, I let you stay up in my spot whenever
If you cold and if I could, I make them change the weather
'Cause when we punch a opp, it's like we glued our hands together
Yeah
My dawg, told you, "I got you"
It's like we glued our hands together
My dawg, you my dawg, my dawg, told you, "I got you"
You my dawg, you my dawg
Need some drank? I'll pour you up until you feelin' better (I'll pour you up)
Anytime we have some beef, I'm always down to settle
Both our blocks had lots of gangs that didn't last forever (they didn't)
We the ones that got our weight up movin' pounds together
We were broke, you picked me up when I was fallin' over (you picked me up)
Had to smoke and I'm the one that you was wildin' over
Expensive taste, got marble counters that I'm countin' over (count up)
Just pull up on me, I shouldn't have to call you over
Just tell me what you need 'cause it ain't hard to get it
Fuck a car, if you ain't drivin' I ain't gettin' in it (no)
It's hard to leave the streets, I know you really in it
I'm worried that you ain't called me, and it's been minute
Our OGs put us down but they kept all the money
Left the town, we ran 'em down 'cause he was actin' funny
You scared to ask for what you need when you could take it from me
I said be careful when you leave, can't let 'em take you from me
Told you that I got, you my dawg forever
I know you broken and you tryna keep your shit together
Pull up on me, I can get some bands together (pull up, bands)
Right or wrong, I told you that I'm down, whatever (whatever)
My girl a brat, I'm not a rat, I don't fight over cheddar (no way)
Leave the key, I let you stay up in my spot whenever
If you cold and if I could, I make them change the weather
'Cause when we punch a opp, it's like we glued our hands together
Yeah
My dawg, told you, "I got you"
It's like we glued our hands together
My dawg, you my dawg, my dawg, told you, "I got you"
You my dawg, you my dawg
Fresh out of jail, I grab the phone
He come my crib when he tired of home (yeah)
Wanna die with my brother, not dyin' alone (yeah)
I wish I was there but he died alone (yeah)
Perc' in my cup, can't feel my arm (yeah)
I stay with my gun, don't feel alarmed (yeah)
Never got shit took out my possession, not even a charm

So many hoes, they call my phone, I pick it up like, "Who is this?"
Don't never ever compare to my brother, like, "Who would win?"
Headshots, body bags forever if you do it again
We split hoes and cash and we gon' have more shit we never had (yeah, yeah)
