Song Name: Richer (feat. Polo G)
The lotta fight I've been in
Ayo Pluto, you goin' brazy

Niggas ain't gettin' no money, tell 'em quit that cappin' (mmm)
Niggas ain't gettin' no money, tell 'em quit that cappin' (mmm, yeah)
In this bitch relaxin', you ain't even did your taxes (yeah)
We went triple platinum, I'on't wanna hear no naggin'
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, made it happen, uh, uh
Youngin' out that bottom, but he made it happen (yeah)
I don't wanna make new friends, point me to my ends
Who he think he is in that brand new Benz?
They should've knew I was comin'
Since a lil' youngin', I knew I would get me some money (skrrt)
Know I turned nothing to something, I look at your cousin (grr)
The youngin', six million and runnin'
And I promise to keep it one hunnid, keep it one hunnid
You see me grindin' and hustlin'
So you got to respect me, fuck you, give me my check, please
Youngin' chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)
A youngin' out that bottom, but he beat the odds (yeah, yeah)
I ain't gon' lie, I had it hard (yeah, yeah)
But now I'm richer than I've ever been (what else?)
I'm richer than I've ever been (yeah)
I'm richer than I've ever been
I'm richer than I've ever been (ever been)
He richer than he ever been (oh, oh, oh)
I'm richer than ever, whippin' a Tesla, cars, hoes, et cetera
Hit him with pressure, my niggas won't let up
Tell them niggas to catch up, oh
Wake up, got a million in diamonds that sit on the dresser, oh
Run up that check, now I'm flexin' my muscles, I feel like a wrestler
'Cause we come from nothin' to Rollies and plaques
Fake love, it was holdin' him back
Flashbacks while he pourin' the yak
Since a young nigga, he just wanted a sack
Used to daydream 'bout thumbin' through racks
Heat tuck, it get cold in the 'Raq
Tears fall while he loadin' the strap
Seen it all, he just wanna relax, uh-uh
I'm richer than I ever been
Put my heart before the bag, worst shit I ever did
Gave you a second chance and you left again, uh
'Member days I used to wonder, "Would we ever win?"
Youngin' chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)
A youngin' out that bottom, but he beat the odds (yeah, yeah)
I ain't gon' lie, I had it hard (yeah, yeah)
But now I'm richer than I've ever been (what else?)
I'm richer than I've ever been (yeah)
I'm richer than I've ever been
I'm richer than I've ever been (ever been)
He richer than he ever been (ever been)
Ever been, yeah
Yeah
