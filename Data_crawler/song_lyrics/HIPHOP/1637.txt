Song Name: Flexin'
Melo
This is Kamale
Ah, look, what the fuck you got that blicky chain on, nigga?
Take it off (look, look)
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did 15 on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big Louboutin when I'm steppin' (steppin')
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
Woo, woo
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did 15 on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
We gon' hit him and finish him, nobody innocent
If you ain't dead better lay down
All the judges giving sentences, free all my menaces
All on the island like, "What now?" (what the fuck is up, nigga?)
Flossy the jungle where niggas gon' rumble
I aim at your head we don't spray ground
We gon' shoot one or two we gon' boom off the room
Back out the chop', we go spray rounds (grrt)
See that .40 on me, roll a forty-clip
I bet I make his ass do forty flips (forty flips)
Sheff G, sauce him up
Sheff G told me, "Sauce him up" (sauce that nigga)
Woo
Fuck KiKi
Tell Shanie he can suck a dick (Bah, bah)
Bullets leaving him sleepy like Hallow
One in the head if a nigga want follow
Niggas only respect you because your brother
Double-punched you and you called your mother
That's what brothers do for one another
That's the only reason I ain't put you under
That double G will make a nigga cry (cry)
Smokin' big KiKi 'til a nigga high
And I can't trust a bitch because these bitches lie
And that's how a couple my niggas died
Yeah, I'm big 092, woo
I'm posted on the lanes I be flossin'
Bentley truck when I'm slidin'
My bitch is exotic, my hands off the wheel when I'm parking
Jamos told me, "Get the cash"
Amiri the denims don't ask what it cost though
He get nailed to the cross if he SRK
Let's talk about it if you feel a way
Nigga everything K
Big 24, don't call me bluff, kick down a door
Big 092, show no remorse
Buyin' designer, all in the stores
Can't get you out, bitch, you a whore
Free all my lil guys, D'usse on the floor
I make a call, bitch and it's war
Two litre Sprite, I pour a four
Pull up TD, I got ten in my jeans
Pop out with me, was on TV
Patek Phillipe, Givenchy tee
I need a mill', been in these streets
Know that I'm Floss, come to the East
LOAB, screamin', "Free Ree" (free Ree)
Shooters in plaza, stay with the sleaze
Or I call a Ape, free Melly Gz
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did 15 on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big Louboutin when I'm steppin' (steppin')
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
Woo, woo
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did 15 on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
