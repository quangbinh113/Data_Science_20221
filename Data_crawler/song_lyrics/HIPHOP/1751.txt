Song Name: We Not Humping - Remix
I ain't got shit for a broke-ass nigga
Ass too fat, but my bag way bigger
Super slim waist (give me your face)
Zip them pants up, stupid-ass nigga
Put that dick up, we not humpin'
Sky Zone, bitch, my block jumpin'
Jump out the black truck, we start dumpin'
In the field with a hundred bands, no trumpet
Main nigga just cut me off, fuck it
Nigga, stop talkin', just come suck it
When it's smoke, bet the opps gon' duck it
We kick smoke up, they kick buckets (yeah, Leo)
Break up with your bitch, it's over (aww)
Pretty bitch, but it gets scary, October (uh-huh)
I'm not the bitch to play with, I told her (no)
When I get mad, I lose my composure (bitch)
Hoes don't want no smoke, they want exposure (uh-huh)
He wanna eat it again, just for closure (uh-huh)
If he a slut, I might let him come over (ooh)
I'm all in his mouth like a god-damn molar (uh-huh)
Full plate, so I need me a big meal (let's go)
Big boss, so a bitch got big bills (uh-huh)
Big Benz, back out with the big wheels (go)
Big L-E-O, I'm a big deal
Put that dick up, we not humpin'
Sky Zone, bitch, my block jumpin'
Jump out the black truck, we start dumpin'
In the field with a hundred bands, no trumpet
Main nigga just cut me off, fuck it
Nigga, stop talkin', just come suck it (hahaha, no for real)
When it's smoke, bet the opps gon' duck it
We kick smoke up, they kick buckets (Flo Milli shit)
Ooh, he comin' off way too pushy (uh, haha)
I hope he don't think he was gettin' this pussy (hell nah)
Aw, he like his bitches psychotic (yeah)
Sit on his face and explain why I'm toxic (uh, eat that thing), uh
How you talk shit, but ain't backin' it up? (Uh-huh)
Your pussy wack, send it back to the club (haha)
I'm a boss bitch, I can't argue with mutts (what?)
Send it straight to the bank, I've been addin' it up (money)
Get rid of his ass, I'm like, "Get on" (goodbye)
Need a new nigga to shit on (haha)
Look at these bitches, I can't take 'em serious (hello)
I'm on your ass, just in case you was curious (bitch, I'm on your ass)
Uh-oh, bitch, I hop out the bed with my mug on (out the bed)
And his jit, he ain't somethin' I could love on
Damn, he talking 'bout cuffin' (what?)
He gotta be stupid to think we was fuckin' (ah-ha)
Put that dick up, we not humpin'
Sky Zone, bitch, my block jumpin'
Jump out the black truck, we start dumpin'
In the field with a hundred bands, no trumpet
Main nigga just cut me off, fuck it
Nigga, stop talkin', just come suck it
When it's smoke, bet the opps gon' duck it
We kick smoke up, they kick buckets
Haha, haha
Wake up, Mr. "I Can't Get Hard"(damn)
Wake up, "Mr. Lick Everywhere But The Fuckin' Clit" (huh?)
Wake up, "Mr. I Need A Break After The First Fuckin' Round" (what the fuck?)
Y'all be weak in the knees, stand up
Stand up!
Flo Milli shit, bitch
It's Leo
