Song Name: Sex Songs
We started a late night, and
Ended up fallin' asleep on the bassline
I know you want me (I know you want me), yeah
But not the way that I want
You stuck on my waistline (waistline), and
You heard from the grapevine that
I make all the bad girls horny
You say he make it rain, I make stormy, yeah
I know you like that n-, but you adore me, yeah
I got your shit so hot, that shit is scorchin', yeah
I bury my face in it 'cause you gorgeous, yeah
Fuckin' you so good, ain't no actin' cordial, oh
Defend you, I'm fuckin' you on a drawer, oh, yeah
Pussy so good, I take you on a tour, oh, yeah
Chokin', spit in her mouth and she want more, oh, yeah
Layin' it down and fuckin' you right
(Baby you like it, I know)
Turn on (baby you like it, the sex songs)
All of the sex songs (want you beside me, oh)
Ain't no way to go wrong (want your body inside of me)
There's no need to pull out

You don't call me
Knowin' I can't know that it's just
You heard from the grapevine that
I know how to make the bad girls horny
I'm suckin' on your waistline
She say the way I sing, this dick should be a state crime, oh
Lickin' that juice, it's like I'm tryna chase my note
She bouncin' on my bed like a bassline, oh
I'm movin' to the front, I'm tryna fuck her face
"Hawk-putuh", tell me, how does that taste?
Tell me you was a freak, didn't know you was that way
She whine slow, bring it up, love that way

And if we finna fuck, let it play shawty
