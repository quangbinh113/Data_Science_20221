Song Name: Waddup (feat. Polo G)
(Fatman, you did this?)
Bitch, waddup? (Yeah)
Ayy, bitch, waddup? (Yeah)
Ayy, bitch, waddup? (Yeah)
(They got Wooskii on the mix) yeah-yeah
Ayy, bitch, waddup? (Waddup?)
They say they on they block, it's time to slide, fuck 'em up (ayy)
Ayy, lil' bro walkin' up, masked up, suited up (suited up)
Ayy, catch 'em by that store, up the pole, shoot it up (shoot it up)
Ayy, switch up on a Glock, make him hop, double Dutch (ayy)
Ayy, lil' bro over cold, he got two poles, doubled up
Ayy, Glizzy, that's my dawg, he'll catch you, bite you up (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, treat the opps like blunts, hit a cut, light 'em up, ayy (yeah-yeah)
Don't hype him up 'cause he'll die
Have your whole block cry, his balloons in the sky
Now the opps want me dead (yeah), so I tell 'em, "Come try"
But I slide first
All they hear is, "Fah-fah-fah", that's that nick', nigga (bitch)
Ayy, that's how I'm comin', bitch
Like a track star, I'm on my block really runnin' shit
I do this shit in real life, boy, this shit is not a skit
'Member puttin' tape up on the mag' just to make it fit
I remember slidin' every day, I wasn't at the park (uh-huh)
I ain't have no lighter, but I really had to make a spark (uh-huh)
Keep that iron on me like my real name was Tony Stark (yeah-yeah)
All you see is spark-spark-spark, I'm tryna leave a mark, nigga
Ayy, bitch, waddup? (Waddup?)
They say they on they block, it's time to slide, fuck 'em up (ayy)
Ayy, lil' bro walkin' up, masked up, suited up (uh-huh)
Ayy, catch 'em by that store, up the pole, shoot it up (yeah)
Ayy, switch up on a Glock, make him hop, double Dutch (yeah)
Ayy, lil' bro over cold, he got two poles, doubled up (uh-huh)
Ayy, Glizzy, that's my dawg, he'll catch you, bite you up (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, treat the opps like blunts, hit a cut, light 'em up, ayy (yeah-yeah)
Glock .40 with a switch on the back
My shorty'll wipe your nose like slatt
You know that back door closed
Kill one of these set-up hoes for thinkin' it's that
We got a chop with a scope, I'ma look in that bitch
'Fore I blink, throw three in his head
Ridin' in bulletproof, whole lot of switches
And Dracs whenever I be in the 'Raq (bitch, ayy)
Waddup? Is you really livin' them lyrics or what?
Hoes play our shit when they get in the truck
And the opps get mad 'cause they listen to us
Told foenem slide and they still in the cut
Hop out, spaz, they pickin' him up
Hot shit made his back start sizzlin' up
He lost his head for forgettin' to duck
We don't play that, new Glock, let it spray like Ajax
Blew him down and it's back to the hood
And we just might have to high-speed on the way back
For BMoney, we throwin' up Bs
Catch one of the Gs, I'm makin' his face crack
We been tryna score for the lead
My shorties been T'd, they shootin' like Trey Stacks, bitch
Ayy, bitch, waddup? (Waddup?)
They say they on they block, it's time to slide, fuck 'em up (ayy)
Ayy, lil' bro walkin' up, masked up, suited up (uh-huh)
Ayy, catch 'em by that store, up the pole, shoot it up (yeah)
Ayy, switch up on a Glock, make him hop, double Dutch (yeah)
Ayy, lil' bro over cold, he got two poles, doubled up (uh-huh)
Ayy, Glizzy, that's my dawg, he'll catch you, bite you up (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, treat the opps like blunts, hit a cut, light 'em up, ayy (yeah-yeah)
(Fatman, you did this?)
