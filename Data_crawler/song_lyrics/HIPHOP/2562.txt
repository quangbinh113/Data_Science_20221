Song Name: Good Friday
Yeah
Yeah
Young nigga can't be stopped, no (ooh, can't stop me)
Locked me outside, took the back way (can't lock me)
Even going high on a bad day
Niggas want smoke, now they sittin' in the ash tray, yeah
Homie, I don't really get the joke (I don't get it)
Gotta send a hatin' nigga that way (that way)
Dead weight sittin' in the pathway (pathway)
Got a good girl, better hit her with your last name, yeah
Coming from the city of cold
My old-heads never seen a milli' before
My dread bro hit me tryna give me a O
My dead bros always with me out on the road
My OGs got my back
And my young boy do not front
Stayed down and I paid my dues
I'm still livin' through my young
And my girl so proud of how much I grew
'Cause that old me held that grudge
This new me let that go
So much I'ma tell my son
So much fun on this run
It's time I collect my rolls
And I know that life
Life is good
Yeah
People wanna see you down bad
I don't do it for these niggas, I just get a good laugh
I'ma keep it real low even though I could brag
I be moving on the hush, picking up a good bag (shhhh)
No flex, just facts
Walking my dog while I'm taking out trash
I am not a fan of replaying my past
Going Super Saiyan every saying I rap
Like yeah
I'ma put the writing on the wall
Lil Kota see it when he grown
Show him how to get it with his hands
It ain't easy tryna be a man
When you only doing what you know
And what you know is limited as fuck
I hope you grow and get the shit you want
I hope it matches up with what you need
And make your life reflect what you believe
Life
Life is good
Life
Life is good
Yeah
Yeah
Put the hate out like a cigarette, ah
Niggas only living on the internet, ah
King Kota, why you ain't bitter yet? Ah
Mad 'cause I haven't hit a ceiling yet, nah
I ain't need a loan or a label
My shit move when I say so
Lil Kota two holding pesos
Fifteen hundred pounds on his birthday
See me Euro stepping through the gates, ho, yeah
I've been through it all, yeah
Wrote down all that I saw, yeah
Broke down, then I woke up, then I rose up
Then I walked out of that door, yeah
We gon' be good, put it on my mama
Sun gon' shine, put it on my commas
Rain gon' come, and we pray for that
'Cause this growth here came from that
And I know that life
Life is good
Life
Life is good
And through all this life
The trials and tribulations
It is imperative
That you know you are where you're supposed to be
They tried to break you
And take your shine
And look at you
Brighter than ever, boy
Won't he do it?
