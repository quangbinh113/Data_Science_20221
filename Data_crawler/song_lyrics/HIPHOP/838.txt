Song Name: Invisible Scars
Pipe that shit up, TNT
Tahj Money
Shaad got K'Round
How's it feel closing million-dollar deals off a cell phone?
Oh, youngin' in the party, running wild with his head gone
If I broke your heart then I'm sorry about it
Real rockstar, living large, invisible scars
She can say, "Come save me"
"Come save me"
She just said, "Come save me"
But I can't be the one (I won't be the one)
Can't be the one
Early mornings and late nights, it be such a sight
I can't even lie, right now's the timе of my life
Tour bus, sliding, even flyin' privatе
High mileage, all around the world, that's high mileage
Keep quiet, keep you fly as hell, brand new YSL
This that new Chanel, can't you tell? Want you to myself
But, I'ma be gone all next week
Sippin' codeine ease the pain
I can't even find my phone
Can't even move out of my head
I don't wanna fight, that's that extra shit
My medicine made me miss your calls and your messages
You're Heaven-sent, just right for me
Fuck these hoes and what they think
I'ma give you everything you want
Just gotta let me chase my dreams
How's it feel closing million-dollar deals off a cell phone? (Yeah, cell phone)
Oh, youngin' in the party, running wild with his head gone (with his head gone)
If I broke ya heart then I'm sorry about it (yeah, yeah)
Real rockstar, living large, invisible scars (invisible scars, yeah)
She can say, "Come save me" (yeah, yeah)
"Come save me" (yeah)
"Come save me" (save me)
I can't be the one, can't be the one (save me, yeah)
Closing million-dollar deals off a cell phone (yeah, yeah)
Youngin' in the party running wild with his head gone (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I broke your heart then I'm sorry about it (I'm sorry)
Real rockstar, living large, invisible scars (invisible scars)
She can say, "Come save me" (save me)
"Come save me"
She just said, "Come save me"
But I can't be the one (I won't be the one)
Can't be the one
