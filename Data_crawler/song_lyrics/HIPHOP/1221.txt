Song Name: Drop Shit
Ayy
Ayy, drop shit
Brodie posted on the block with a fully loaded Glock
When he see a opp, bet that he gon' pop it (gon' pop it)
Who would ever thought that I'd be on top?
Signing bitches titties in the crowd while they doing mosh pits (doing mosh pits)
Get a bitch from after the show, give her dick 'til she throw up
I got her and friends saying that I'm toxic (that I'm toxic)
Nigga think that I'm a hoe, it's gon' go up
I been a lot of shit in my life but a bitch, I am not it (I am not it)
I done seen a lot of smoke (lot of smoke)
But barking up this tree you gon' get smoked (smoked)
Do what I please, I can't please no hoe
'Cause all these bitches be on go (go)
I'm taking off, you better like the way
Ain't got the time for typing, bae
I been tryna run up this paper
A hundred different type ways
Low-key think he playing with my cheese but I'ma find out
Thinking two steps ahead, I'ma blow his mind out
I ain't going for none of that running shit like a running back
Once I leave, I ain't coming back
I act different when I'm detached
Fuck a love, I don't love her back
Unless a opp ain't get whacked
What you saying? I ain't trusting
I can tell when it's facts
I can tell if it's real
Re-up on your loyalty skills
'Cause I can tell you right now how I feel
If you don't reconcile with me, you might get killed
Ayy, drop shit

'Cause all these bitches be on go (go)
On go for a rich clit
Lick bitch, thick bitch but can't take D (she can't take D)
Yo, famous bitches on my hit list (on my list)
Kinda crazy 'cause they was just on my wish list
Bet I get all of 'em like it's Christmas
Give 'em good dick, and then they get dick miss
Am I wrong? I know I ain't tripping
When I used to shoot my shot, I couldn't hit shit
Now bitches want Mr. to Mrs.
The whole family with white picket fences
When I say bitches don't take no offenses
Not talking about the queens but the ones penny-pinchin'
My point of view might be different, but I stand on what I believe
You can take it or leave it, and trust me, it's fine with me
One thing about me, I'ma be straight regardless, I'm heartless
A lot of shit I seen done scarred me
Ayy, drop shit
