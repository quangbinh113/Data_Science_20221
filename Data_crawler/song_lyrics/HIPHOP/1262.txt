Song Name: Good Day
I'm out of my mind, I'm out of my mind
And I can't take it, I can't take it
Who are you to tell me who to be?
I be walking on the moon, off the shrooms and the lean
Got a grip on the world, I'm okay with who I am
I feel free, watch me soar, I love counting up the ends
It's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high
Yeah
New whip, too quick for them fuck niggas (Fuck niggas)
Can't vibe with you, I don't even fuck with you (Nah, nah)
Like a bad dream, felt like I was stuck with you
But now I'm up and she wanna fall in love, how?
How I feel? Man, I'm feeling great, yeah
Roll a Backwood, take it to the face, huh
Remember I was down, but I won the race, yeah
I left my hometown, pull up in a Wraith
I left out of town, pull up in a Wraith
Talk to my accountant, hundred in the bank, yeah (Yeah)
So it's fuck what you think
I'm on my way, I love counting blue faces
Who are you to tell me who to be?
I be walking on the moon, off the shrooms and the lean
Got a grip on the world, I'm okay with who I am
I feel free, watch me soar, I love counting up the ends
It's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high
It's gon', it's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high
