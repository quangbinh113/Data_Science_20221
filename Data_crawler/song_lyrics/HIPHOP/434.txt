Song Name: Sickening
Hahahaha
Huh, I don't feel too well (Too well)
Rolex on me sick, it don't feel too well (Too well)
The gang throwin' up we don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Said my neck is freezin' cold, I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Mama hit my phone,
Say she worried 'bout my health (Worried 'bout my), yeah
I don't feel too well (Feel too well),
I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
I don't feel too well (Feel too well), yeah
I don't feel too well, I don't feel too well
Pneumonia in my nails, I drip in Chanel
Underdog gon' give 'em hell, beat the pussy 'til it's pale
Fuck her, make her yell, countin' all this green, my kale
You got old, yeah, bitch you stale, how you ridin' and you tell?
Everyone for themselves, man, this world so cold
And my wrist so cold, man I'm sick, I got a cold
Need a fuckin' mink coat (Coat), yeah
Pour me up a four like I got a strep throat
Huh, I don't feel too well (Too well)
Rolex on me sick, it don't feel too well (Too well)
The gang throwin' up we don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Said my neck is freezin' cold, I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Mama hit my phone,
Say she worried 'bout my health (Worried 'bout my), yeah
I don't feel too well (Feel too well),
I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
I don't feel too well (Feel too well), yeah
I don't feel too well, I don't feel too well
Lil Tory!
All this shit and all it ain't no biggie
Ayy, best believe it, bitch, this ain't no Ripley
My shooters shootin', ask him, is he dead?
We left that boy the color Trippie dreads
All my dawgs rich as hell, yeah
Flip them bitches in the mail, yeah
Flip them bitches off the scale, yeah
Made a mil' and screaming, "Hell yeah"
Bad lil' bitch and she Brazilian
Took her out to eat Italian
Fucked your bitch and she should tell ya
Fucked your bitch and she said, "Hell yeah"
Fucked your bitch and she said, "Hell yeah"
Took the bitch into a newer lane
Shitted on your jeweler, new manure
How I do maneuver in the new Mulsanne
Popping on your bitch, I'm doing things
Popping on your bitch, I'm doing things
Got the red diamond shining blue range
I'ma pull up on him with his boo thang
Yeah, my ringer ringing, switching colors on 'em
Baby, but it's not a mood ring
I done kept this shit hotter than blue flame
And these sucka niggas made my mood change
Cops, all them niggas, they under me
They down to shoot when it come to me
That's all I keep in my company
That's all I keep in my company
Huh, I don't feel too well (Too well)
Rolex on me sick, it don't feel too well (Too well)
The gang throwin' up we don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Said my neck is freezin' cold, I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
Mama hit my phone,
Say she worried 'bout my health (Worried 'bout my), yeah
I don't feel too well (Feel too well),
I don't feel too well (Feel too well)
I don't feel too well (Feel too well), yeah
I don't feel too well, I don't feel too well
