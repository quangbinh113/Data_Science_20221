Song Name: Laffy Taffy
Hey, hey, hey
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Candy girl
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Oh, I'm lookin' for Mrs. Bubble Gum, I'm Mr. Chick-O-Stick
I wanna dun-dun-dun, oh, 'cause you so thick
Girls call me Jolly Rancher, oh, 'cause I stay so hard
You can suck me for a long time, oh my God
Girl, this ain't no dance floor, this a candy store
And I'm really geeked up, and I got more dro'
I pop, I roll, it's all I know
It's the summertime but yo laffy taffy got me froze (oh)
Get loose (oh), get low (oh)
Don't be shy, I'm Fabo (oh)
I know you wanna ride, you a star and it shows
What's happenin'? Whassup, whassup let's go, let's go, let's go
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
C'mon trick, c'mon trick
Here go Mr. Chocolate
I like the way you break it down
Waddle, stop you watchin' me
Laffy taffy I'm likin' this
Big ole ass you shakin' bitch
Close yo' mouth and don't say shit
Bend on over and hit a split
Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, yo' ankles swell
Girl, lemme touch ya
I will never tell
Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that hoe
All this money just hit the floor
D4L, I'm ready to go
Hoe can't even shake no more
They tired out, let's ride out
Bitch you wanna go then she can go
She get in my car, I ain't playin' no more
Start movin' on my Fabo
Big shit poppin', I already know
Lemme see that laffy taffy
(Dun-dun-dun)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Hey, say baby girl
Oh, what you gon' do?
I got a hundred ones
I wanna pour on you
Just keep that ass shakin'
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a player sippin' Grey Goose
Feelin' all loose
'Cause girl you on yo' job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On them stilettos
You made it skeet-skeet-skeet
Like a water hose
(Candy girl) Got me goin' in my pocket pullin' out more dough
Let the waitress know I need to order, five hundred more
You can best believe later on we headed to the mo'
So go on and pack them bags, and let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on yo' fine ass at the front door
Girl, you don't know
I'ma toss that laffy taffy, toss it, flip it, and stab it
Bust a couple of nuts and get right back at it
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
