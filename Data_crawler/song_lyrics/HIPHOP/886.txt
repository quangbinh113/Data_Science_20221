Song Name: 3500 (feat. Future & 2 Chainz)
Bandana wrapped, wrapped 'round your head
The bandana wrapped 'round your head
Fuck niggas, they're shit
Ain't nobody triller than me
Ain't nobody triller than Scott
Ain't nobody trill man, I'm takin' their spot
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Ladies order up the champagne, a whole lot of it
Painkillers, they got back pain, know you gotta love it
Tens out in N-Y, they in my hallways, I gotta lobby of 'em
Up and down with Chase, Monday nights, we made a hobby of it
Still down with the same dogs, man they never loved us
Gave my niggas all gold chains to remind me of it
We're still holding that old thing, tryna rob me of it
One time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it
I'm papi though, they get it poppin' with me when I'm out in public
Flyin' through, I got a young 'Yonce with an Iggy on her
Me and Metro do the same drugs, got a lot of it
All these cups and damn, all these hoes, these niggas up to somethin'
Touch down out in H-Town, there it might get ugly
Its trill niggas wit trill niggas, a whole army of 'em
I run the check up, I'm a hot nigga, don't tell my 'countant on me
Free Rowdy Rowdy, free Bobby Bobby, them the Shmurda homies
Good lord!
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Dro with me, drank with me, lean like I'm Clark
Copping a Wraith then I throw it in park
You niggas from Mars, you ain't got no heart
I know lil one gon come with that A and that R
(Only trill niggas I know)
I know lil one gon come with that A and that R
I'm counting I'm dripping I'm fiending
I'm not from this planet, I was abandoned
Trill niggas real niggas popping them pill niggas
I stack up a mil nigga like its a lil nigga
This for the one that's gon' load up the k for me
This for the ones that ran off and didn't wait on me
This for the ones that ran off and didn't wait on me
This for you bitch you ran off and did weight for me
(Only trill niggas I know)
Hood nigga fuck all that red carpet shit
Hood nigga I fuck a red carpet bitch
I put a Rolls and a Royce on my wrist
You can smell promethazine when I piss
I pray to God he bring me Actavis
Ain't nobody triller than Metro ain't nobody triller than Scooter
Hop on the private I do it, take all the mollies I do it
The Bentley put up with no mileage I do it
These Styrofoams with me legitimate
I'm proudly down these Percocets
We just want to be stoners lately, I've been on on on
This money an option, this weed is an option, this lean is an option
Your bitch is an option, her bitch is an option
I send them through auctions
You paying that price for that punanay
This gold on my neck is a new Grammy
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
My bathtub the size of a swimming pool
Backstroke to my children room
Maybach in the living room
I spent racks on these tennis shoes
Niggas know what I'm finna do
Time for me to put the mink up
Forgiattos on a Brinks truck
My favorite rapper drove a pink truck
I do shit that you dream of
I was born with a mean mug
I was born with nappy hair, drinkin' breast milk out a lean cup
Tity Boi's my alias
Real niggas my radius
Trill niggas on the song with me
If she bad as hell I'll pay the babysitter
In a black Mercedes with her
Doin' about 180 with her
I was born a hustler paraphernalia in my baby pictures
Resident all eloquent, leather shit in my front yard
TV by my swimming pool, got the bitch like a sports bar
Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car
Ya my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras
Crib bigger than your imagination
Call the trap house the gas station
Call momma's house the Jag station
Emoji sad faces
Look at these niggas
I need to buy pocketbooks for these niggas
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Ain't nobody triller than me
Ain't nobody triller than Scott
Ain't nobody trill man I'm takin' their spot
We ride on a yacht
Ain't nobody triller than Metro, ain't nobody triller than Scooter
Ain't nobody triller, I knew it, ain't nobody triller, we knew it
Pour up an Ace out on niggas, don't play 'round like Janice and Judy
(Only reall niggas keep it float)
Say fuck all the rumors say fuck all the rumors
(Only trill niggas I know)
Say fuck all the rumors say fuck all the rumors
(Only trill niggas I know)
Say fuck all the rumors say fuck all the rumors
30s in the city movin' slow
$3, 500 for the coat
Only real niggas keep you float
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
Only trill niggas I know
