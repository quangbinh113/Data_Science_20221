Song Name: complicate it
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
Girl, why you playin'?
Life could be amazing
But we go through these phases
I don't think that I could change ya
Talk girl, what you wanna say?
Really had a hard time going through the change
Saying you feeling heart broke, I ain't do a thing
You love to walk around where you ain't supposed to be
You know, I got a hard time with letting you go
Mixed feelings bottled up, getting hard to control
I really don't think that it's part of my role
Keep switching up on me
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
Girl, why you playin'?
Life could be amazing
But we go through these phases
I don't think that I could change ya
Dragging me along for entertainment
A crazy way of showing how you feel before you say it
You started mixing up your words, switching up so fast
I'm bad at guessing how it end, then how to make this last
Rollercoaster, going through the highs and lows
I keep riding when the tracks are froze
I'll admit it, I'm scared
No tellin' where it's about to go
It's weighing on me and it really shows, uh-oh
It's complicated enough
When it don't gotta be
It's probably safer to jump
But it's too late for me
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
I'm sick of being in the same situation with you
Hard times get harder everyday to consume
You mix lies with what happened, got me thinkin' it's true
You always complicate it
Girl, why you playin'?
Life could be amazing
But we go through these phases
I don't think that I could change ya
