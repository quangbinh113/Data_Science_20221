Song Name: 24 (feat. Lil Baby)
Yo, Nflated, spice that bitch up
Burnin' on Lilikoi, ashes look corduroy
RIP Kobe Bryant, RIP 24
I can make a cool 50K in less than 24-hours
Ridin' with the pack through the Tennessee mountains
VPN, SOCKS, and at least three routers
I'm thumbin' through it, I'on need no counter
I had to resuscitate a bih', my neck almost drowned her
I got oil, I got hemp, I got wax, I got flower
Burnin' on pre-roll, finna go to Pluto
Drippin' real hard when I'm hoppin' out two-door
I just met a psychedelic plug named Hugo
30 laptops in my motherfuckin' condo
White collar got a nigga ballin' like Lonzo
These niggas overrated like Joe Flacco
Feelin' like Jim Jones, nigga, I'm a capo
I'ma flip the road route, feelin' like Pop Smoke
Banana cream cake in my motherfuckin' headwrap
If I'on like the smell then the pack get sent back
If I don't like his energy, I push a nigga shit back
Megan had us all listenin' to Bagg, big facts
Megan has us all listenin' to stream, big facts
All that slick talkin' finna get a nigga kidnapped
Just in, gotta FN, finna go and lift-off
I'ma empty out the magazine when I'm pissed off
I'm on that Wedding Pie, it got me geeked
My bitch hit it twice and then she went to sleep
I drop bud on the clock with the perfect technique
I'ma hit it from the rear, I wan' grab her obliques
I ain't got time in the day for my females be mad at me
Internet racks, I'ma run it up rapidly
She know I'm vicious, I'm fuckin' her savagely
She know I get racks, she know my mentality
Grew up in the trap watching Kobe yam on a nigga
Pull up in the Porsche, yeah, the Pan' on a nigga
Yeah, pull in a dodge, yeah, the Ram on a nigga
Anybody try, yeah, I'ma blam on niggas
I'm the head bad guy, 50 different grid lines
Turn a lacefront to a fire, fire hairline
I was over drippin', I should start my own clothing line
Got two jits, dawg, I'll die for both of mine
I ain't never satisfied 'til my money increase
Fucked up the profile, too many inquiries
They be low-key hatin', I can hear 'em whispering
All these baguette chains, you can see 'em glimmering
Had to make a U-turn, I just seen a roadblock
I ain't playin' no games, I ain't sparin no opp
It's a full moon now, so I'm burnin' moonrock
Livin' off schemes, why is he on tip-top?
Burnin' on Lilikoi, ashes look corduroy
RIP Kobe Bryant, RIP 24
I can make a cool 50K in less than 24-hours
Ridin' with the pack through the Tennessee mountains
VPN, SOCKS, and at least three routers
I'm thumbin' through it, I'on need no counter
Had to resuscitate a bih', my neck almost drowned her
I got oil, I got hemp, I got wax, I got flower
A1 Zone 4, I'm feelin' like Rocko
Big, big spender, take a jet to Morocco
I got pretty women showin' titties like I'm Flacko
I came in a hard top, I'm still in the drop, though
I can make the charts drop whenever I wan' drop somethin'
I can give my big bro a dime, he'll pop somethin'
These niggas not real slime, they imposter
I know that my opps somewhere, now I'm now playin' possum
I come from a different type of cloth, we 'on't gossip
Pussy nigga actin' like it's up, we'll chop him
She diggin' the rocks in my ear, I'm a rockstar
Come from out the trenches, gettin' paid like a popstar
I be sellin' weed by the P like a Rasta
Who was in the car? Only me and a chopper
I can make they heart stop if I decide to pop up
I can make a million every month and don't drop none
I found out a way to make a thousand-dollar profit, uh
Pilot say it's smellin' like weed in the cockpit
I done made a quarter this week in Huaraches
Top model with me tryna feed me hibachi
I done got too much to lose, I'm cautious
I done ran it up, I got 16 watches
Which one I'ma drive? I got 16 options
Hoppin' out 30 clip, bangin' 4 Pockets
Burnin' on Lilikoi, ashes look corduroy
RIP Kobe Bryant, RIP 24
