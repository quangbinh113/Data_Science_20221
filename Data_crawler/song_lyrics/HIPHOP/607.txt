Song Name: Pretty Girls
No-no-no
Don't waste my time
100 missed calls, you cryin'
Why you always hit my line, with the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun, get drunk, get fucked up
Why you hittin' my line, always talking 'bout the same shit?
Wastin' my time, starting to think that you're brainless
One of a kind, is what you had me thinking you were
Out of my mind, and the truth hurts, damn
So I can't lie, it's been better with you out my life
Gotta pay no mind
'Cause every time I think about you I get low (huh)
Get low
When I get home, baby gon' drop that low
And I'm rocking ice gold
White gold on me and it's shining like froze
Don't waste my time
100 missed calls, you cryin'
Why you always hit my line, with the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun, get drunk, get fucked up
Don't waste my time
100 missed calls, you cryin'
Why you always hit my line, with the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun, get drunk, get fucked up
Why you hittin' my line, always talking 'bout the same shit?
Wastin' my time, starting to think that you're brainless
One of a kind, is what you had me thinking you were
Out of my mind, and the truth hurts, damn
Yeah, we could always bring it back, bae
I don't need to love her, but I lay you like a track, ayy
Fell in love with all these racks (all these racks, uh, uh)
So I could never take you back (no)
Missed calls, missed sex, I don't hit you back
You got me one time, I could give you that
If I'm tellin' the truth, I ain't missin' that (No, oh, oh)
Don't waste my time
100 missed calls, you cryin'
Why you always hit my line, with the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun, get drunk, get fucked up
Don't waste my time
100 missed calls, you cryin'
Why you always hit my line, with the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun, get drunk, get fucked up
Why you hittin' my line
Always talking 'bout the same shit? (same shit)
(Pretty girls wanna have fun)
Wastin' my time, starting to think that you're brainless (brainless)
Get drunk, get fucked up
