Song Name: Afterlife
Oh I'm crazy
I'm popping my shit every morning (popping my shit)
Then I go to paradise
Cough syrup got me dozin' off (Wheezy outta here)
I can see you in my afterlife
He's 'bout to clip me then he drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' on the couch, I'm on fire
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I thank Allah I'ma get my money and I don't get tired
Sit in the back of the Phantom and have a good night
I had to take Methanol, lit up like a light
I can't see nothin' in the way, gone outta sight
I get her lace on daily basis, yeah she my type
I pop my shit and live lavish, I never switch sides
You go to college, get a crib off the clothes I buy
We get on the top of the fuckin' Hills off Sunset Drive
I'm a product of the field, I'm just in my disguise
Hit the trippin' off a pill but don't give me some cake
I've been jumpin' on these Lears, that's the way I'ma chase 'em
Franklins comin' by the layers, that's the way we gon' make 'em
She don't know when I'ma pop up so she gotta sleep naked
I can tell the way they treat me, they gon' say I'm the greatest
Ain't no tellin' if I leave, if I'ma ever come back (Pluto)
Ain't gon' never let a disloyal bitch hold me back
I done called you out to my bank, so it could hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq
You can't help who you love nigga (can't help who you love)
That's why God made thug niggas (yeah, straight up)
Cough syrup got me dozin' off
I can see you in my afterlife
He's 'bout to clip me then he drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' on the couch, I'm on fire
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I thank Allah I'ma get my money and I don't get tired
I thank Allah I'ma get my checks, fuck you niggas
I need to get it off my chest, fuck you niggas
I got my hitters in the cut, I'm still that nigga
I got her flattin' out her tummy, I'm that nigga (super)
Takin' my time, my new bank account gettin' taller
I flood-out Richard
That gon' cost me at least a quarter (least a quarter)
I done been in my bag lately and I been poppin' my collar (my bag)
I got a good taste in bitches 'cause they swallow (yeah)
I done birthed a lotta lil' niggas, I'm their father (Future)
Can't be responsible for how you move, 'cause I taught ya (I can)
Keep it a thousand, ok bool
That's how I was brought up (one thousand)
Lil' nigga had to pay his dues, man, slaughter (free Lu)
Nine bracelets on me, baby, hold on, wait (hold on)
Nine rings on me, baby, hold on, wait (I'm the champ)
Got that Glizzy on me, baby, hold on, wait (that's a Glock)
Don't be shy with that pussy, hold on, wait (yeah, mine)
90 vibes at the crib, pick a race (yes)
I would've said at least one hundred to play it safe (robbin' the safe)
When it come to loud, I'ma roll with Grade A (Grade A)
I don't go outta town unless I'm fillin' up the safe
I done crocodile my Pradas, just to hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq
You can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas
You can't help who you love, nigga
I'm poppin' my shit every mornin'
Then I go to paradise
Can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas
