Song Name: Do Better
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta (they will always haunt my dreams)
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta (the green twins with your eyes)
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
(They will always haunt my dreams)
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, today
Gotta do better b–µfore it's too late
Said, I gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta (they will always haunt my dreams)
Pick up the pieces and master the puzzle upon us (the green twins with your eyes)
Look the man in the mirror in the eye and be honest
Slow down time, get back in line with my chakras (they will always haunt my dreams)
Reach for the galaxy
Leave stardust for thus after me (the green twins with your eyes)
Into the void, fill in the cavity
Risk the reward if that's how it has to be (they will always haunt my dreams)
I gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta do
Everything in my power to try to do what God would do (the green twins with your eyes)
Ride the tide, don't fight with the current that guided you
Melt the ice 'round the furnace burnin' inside you (they will always haunt my dreams)
I gotta do better, I gotta do better, I guided you better
There's nothin' they can do that I can't do better (the green twins with your eyes)
Better yet, there's nothin' I can do that I can't do better
Yeah, I'm better (they will always haunt my dreams)
I said, I'm better
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
(They will always haunt my dreams)
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, today
Gotta do better, before its too late
Shades stuck to my face, hoodie glued to my head (they will always haunt my dreams)
Hidin' from the same world that made me who I am (the green twins with your eyes)
Deep rest, can't even get out of bed
Too blessed to be so stressed (they will always haunt my dreams)
I do all this shit, just to say, get off my dick
Mix the emotions, prohibit my focus (the green twins with your eyes)
This what you wanted, what's wrong with you? You don't make sense
Feel like I can flip at any moment (they will always haunt my dreams)
Faces playin' and it's fuckin' with me
Doin' drugs, was just a war with boredom, but it's sure to get me
Lord forgive me (the green twins with your eyes), amen
Wear the crown of thorns for sport
I'm just waitin' for a stone to hit me (they will always haunt my dreams)
Uh, relationship on the rocks, my family all concerned (the green twins with your eyes)
My homie still on the block, gettin' it off the the curb
I'm striken by survivor's guilt, I'm gettin' it off of words
Word (they will always haunt my dreams)
Come on, Herb, you
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
(They will always haunt my dreams)
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta
Gotta do better, I gotta do better, today
Gotta do better before it's too late
I'm dyin' (they will always haunt my dreams)
But I'm gone with the wind
And I'm gone with the wind, you leave (the green twins with your eyes)
You feel me on your skin (your skin)
'Cause I'm gone with the wind (they will always haunt my dreams)
And I'm gone with the wind
And I'm gone with the wind, you leave (the green twins with your eyes)
You feel me on your skin (your skin)
And I'm gone with the wind, baby
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
