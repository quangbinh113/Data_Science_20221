Song Name: Moon
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (how could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (how could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (how could I get through?)
Mhm, here we go strapping, we up
Never forget all the memories
Sitting, I sip out my cup
Thinking I should be a better me
Truly, I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, troublin' my soul
Hey, I've been praying, life can be draining, oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep hauling on
I'm ashamed and yet, what I will see?
Ain't nobody knows, so I go
How can I get through? (don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (to the moon)
How can I get through? (to the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon take you to the moon
Don't leave so soon (whoa), don't leave so soon
How could I get through? (yeah)
How can I get through? (ooh)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon, don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (how could I get through?)
Yeah-ayy, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
How can I get through? How can I get through?
How can I get through? How can I get through?
How can I get through?
