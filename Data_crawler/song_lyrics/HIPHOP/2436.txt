Song Name: top gun
Slow down, hold up
Let me pick the phone up
Pussy boy, shut up (fa-na-na-na, na-na)
Fill my teacup, my girl bossed up
Yeah, she kinda stuck up (fa-na-na-na)
Your lady thirsty, don't show mercy
She too curvy, controversy
She suck my D, cure her scurvy
She so mad, she Eddie Murphy
Call her mommy (she call me daddy)
She bad and boujee (Downton Abbey)
I'm poppin' tags (I'm poppin' tags)
I'm in this bitch (we makin' slappers, uh)
One, I'ma wake on up
Two, I'ma get my bath
Three, I'ma bust a nut
Four, I'ma blow that bag
Five, don't regret that shit
Six, I'ma text my bitch
Seven, we gon' cry a bit
Eight, we don't give a shit (do you want it?)
Dick game average, but I know how to thrust (you know I got it)
My shawty bad and independent likе Russ (so, do you want it?)
$40K, I'm 'bout my price going up (you know I got it)
Stop complaining, lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Slow down, hold up
Let mе pick the phone up
Pussy boy, shut up (fa-na-na-na, na-na)
Fill my teacup, my girl bossed up
Yeah, she kinda stuck up (fa-na-na-na)
Your lady thirsty, don't show mercy
She too curvy, controversy
She suck my D, cure her scurvy
She so mad, she Eddie Murphy
Call her mommy (she call me daddy)
She bad and boujee (Downton Abbey)
I'm poppin' tags (I'm poppin' tags)
I'm in this bitch (we makin' slappers, uh)
My momma call me, says she loves this new one (I love you mom)
We talkin' money, then consider it done (that shit was easy)
I might be short like Tom, but I'm the Top Gun (mom, it's impossible)
Goodness gracious, yeah, this shit goin' dumb (so, do you want it?)
Check just hit the bank and it was substantial (you know I got it)
Take a self-care day, this boy needs a facial (so, do you want it?)
Goddamn, I drip too hard, my fits be post-nasal (you know I got it)
Lil' shawty tie me up, I feel like Criss Angel
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? (Uh)
Your lady thirsty, don't show mercy
She too curvy, controversy
She suck my D, cure her scurvy
She so mad, she Eddie Murphy
Call her mommy (she call me daddy)
She bad and boujee (Downton Abbey)
I'm poppin' tags (I'm poppin' tags)
I'm in this bitch (we makin' slappers, uh)
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
Can you hear me? Yes, we can
