Oh, no
Oh, no, oh
Oh, oh no
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh
NLE the top shotta
I got the bomb like Al-Qaeda
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she blocked me (Blocked me)
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the Roxys (On the Roxys)
Gotta call, my nigga died, I nearly skipped a heartbeat (Skipped a heartbeat)
Lookin' for your love, but yo' feelings is departin' (Departin')
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thuggin' in the Choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke
Because you know that we gon' bang it out
I don't even know which car I'ma drive (Drive)
Roll a three-five, now I'm too damn high (Too damn high)
Bitch, I'm in my zone, don't you kill my vibe (Don't you kill my vibe)
If a nigga play, you know them choppas gon' ride (Ride)
The micro Draco clip, it look like a banana (Banana)
A nigga look wrong in this bitch, we gonna blam him (Grr, grr)
A lot of choppas when we ride, raise the count up (Raise the count up)
I robbed a corner store, the gun over the counter (Uh, uh, uh)
And I ain't gotta spin back because I know he's dead
Ain't no surviving when you shoot a nigga right in his head
Paramedics answer questions 'bout that boy and the meds
But they know he ain't gon' make it so they pronounced him dead
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she blocked me (Blocked me)
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the roxys (On the Roxys)
Gotta call, my nigga died, I nearly skipped a heartbeat (Skipped a heartbeat)
Lookin' for your love, but yo' feelings is departin' (Departin')
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thuggin' in the Choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke
Because you know that we gon' bang it out
They gon' feel me, NLE the motherfuckin'...
NLE the top shotta, yeah
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her wit my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thuggin' in the Choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke
Because you know that we gon' bang it out
