Song Name: Where Did U Go?
Listen close, what is this?
Is it heartbreak?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I can't seem to get out my head (Out my head)
I wept and I'll count the tears I shed (Tears I shed, tears I)
She sat there and watched as I bled
As I bled, as I bled, as I bled
As I bled, as I bled,
As I bledAnd where did you go as I slipped (As I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (Out my head)
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos
2: Juice WRLD]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still
Don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the
Times Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos
And where did you go as I slipped (As I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (Out my head)
