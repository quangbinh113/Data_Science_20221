Song Name: 4 The Win
Nathaniel London
Yeah, woo
Yeah, long stick, got a limp
20 hoes like a pimp
It's DBE for the win (yeah)
No school grades, I got M's
Got brothers, I don't keep friends
She said, "Bae, I hope this never ends" (yeah)
Got a Transit van full of ki's
Love the hustle, I will never leave
Love the hustle, I will never leave (yeah)
Got a few tricks up my sleeve
Went to Birmingham for this machine
Fly you out, we fuck on Nikki Beach (yeah)
Don't do back and forths, I send niggas to send corn
Tweetin' that I'm cheatin', bitch, I don't even watch porn
All my hunters hungry like some bees, they gonna swarm
Pull up where you are, stick you like a thorn
I still got three or four trap phones, my youngins wanna ramp
All we did was chase our dreams, made "Trap House" while I was on the run (on God)
If money turn you on, that won't stop, make you cum
Pray I never do you wrong
'Cause I'll know that you'll be done (yeah, yeah, yeah)
VVS1, see the rainbow (huh)
Niggas turn fake, that's how the game goes (uh)
No bunkbeds in the grave, dawg (uh)
Bunkbeds in the damn cage though (uh)
Gang, gang, gang in the jailhouse (yeah)
Millionaire, I'll post bail now
Platinum Rollie, I dress well now
Wish that I could burn the jail down
Long stick, got a limp
20 hoes like a pimp
It's DBE for the win (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No school grades, I got M's
Got brothers, I don't keep friends
She said, "Bae, I hope this never ends" (yeah)
Got a Transit van full of ki's
Love the hustle, I will never leave
Love the hustle, I will never leave (yeah)
Got a few tricks up my sleeve
Went to Birmingham for this machine
Fly you out, we fuck on Nikki Beach (yeah)
My eyes, my eyes look like a rainbow (yeah)
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ya dig?)
Her eyes, her eyes look like the pain go (oh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (yeah)
We used to just trap out the Civic and now my life, it feel limitless (yeah)
Doin' my brother real dirty, they look at my nigga like prisoners (mm-mm)
They think that my life is too easy, it's different, I'm here and I'm livin' it (mm-mm)
I came to the trench in the Rolls and I step around with a privilege (ski)
I just put back the Range trip
I just took back the pain, yeah
I told my nigga to pull out the cars, he pullin' the fleet out (fleet out)
My little nigga start servin' the hard, he bustin' his teeth down (ya dig?)
He bustin' the Rollie already, he ain't split the bag with just anyone (no)
Spend it on many guns, just attach the grip so it's steady, son
Brand new switch on the glizzy, gotta make sure you ready (skrrt, skrrt)
Brand new switch on the glizzy, gotta make sure you ready (skrrt)
Girl so fussy on her nails, gonna look around town for a pedi (ya dig?)
I've been gettin' money like Ed but I still go dumb like Eddy (skrrt)
Yeah, long stick, got a limp
20 hoes like a pimp
It's DBE for the win (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No school grades, I got M's
Got brothers, I don't keep friends
She said, "Bae, I hope this never ends" (yeah)
Got a Transit van full of ki's
Love the hustle, I will never leave
Love the hustle, I will never leave (yeah)
Got a few tricks up my sleeve
Went to Birmingham for this machine
Fly you out, we fuck on Nikki Beach (yeah, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski)
