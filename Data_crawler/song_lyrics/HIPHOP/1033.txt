Song Name: Red
Yeah, yeah (Tory on the beat, Tory on the beat)
Red, red, red, red
Bitch, yeah (fuck)
(Hahaha)
In a coupe and it's all red, come inside my bed (yeah)
Flex up on my ex, she gon' wanna do my dreads (woo)
Where I put my med? I can't feel my heart, I'm dead (haha)
Soul up in the sky, see my body on a bed (fuck)
In a coupe and it's all black (black), bro, I can't relax
Got a Sprite with lemon 'gac ('gac), think I might relapse (uh)
Get the fuck up out my way (fuck out my way)
Bitch, I got a strap (bitch)
Body on the ground, we gon' leave you where you lay
Open up my mind (yeah), it ain't even time (huh)
Coco pineapple with lime (haha), with this Glock, I let it shine
She just wanna know my signs (yeah), dick all up in her spine (ah)
Pull up to the block, I'm hot (ha), you're just mad because you're not
Getting paid, I'm counting knots (yeah), makin' money walks (yeah)
First of all, I can't fuck with cops (huh?), put they body in a box (ha)
Hennessy up in my bottle (bow), bitch, I'm goin' full throttle (yeah)
Hennessy up in my cup, bitch, I'm gonna live it up (haha)
Had enough, my tommy tucked, pull up in a F1 truck (ah)
Bodybag up in a lake (ah), oh, my God, I think he dead (ah)
I'ma pick his body up, oh, my God, I see the head (fuck)
Leave the leg up on the floor, oh my God, I see the red (huh)
In a coupe and it's all red, come inside my bed (yeah)
Flex up on my ex, she gon' wanna do my dreads (woo)
Where I put my med? I can't feel my heart, I'm dead (haha)
Soul up in the sky, see my body on a bed (fuck)
In a coupe and it's all black (black), bro, I can't relax
Got a Sprite with lemon 'gac ('gac), think I might relapse (uh)
Get the fuck up out my way (fuck out my way)
Bitch, I got a strap (bitch)
Body on the ground, we gon' leave you where you lay
