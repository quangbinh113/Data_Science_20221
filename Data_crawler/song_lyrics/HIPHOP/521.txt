Song Name: Celebration Station
And I can't do my dance 'cause my pants they from...
They from France
I can't slow this
(I'm working on dying) Yeah
No, I can't slow it (fast-paced all the time, yeah, yeah)
One, two, three, yeah! (Ayy, Brandon, man, why you do that?)
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (let's go, yeah)
Yeah, what is mine, that is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stackin' this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans
My choppa get hot just like a pan
Knock your headlights just like a ram
I got ten toes, and I count up, ten fingers
So I do not need an, um, helping hand
Monopoly crib, I'm movin' again
Got your bitch on me, she groovin' again (let's go)
Lamborghini just give them a reason to hate
So my niggas shootin' again
My coupe, my roof, drop that shit again
She sucked my dick, then she mopped up my friend
No, we do not wanna feel tooth again
When she let me go, I'm on the loose again (bye-bye)
She on the molly, she tryna boot again
She ain't even mine, this girl is a lend
I prayed every time when I thought you sinned
I write in my mind, I don't use a pen, yeah
She givin' me time, my watch cost a Lam'
Just give me more time, other watch cost a Benz (yeah, yeah)
Look at Lil Uzi, he poppin' again
Them niggas, they switchin', they hoppin' again (yeah)
Look at them niggas, they oppin' again
She givin' that top, and she sloppin' again (woah)
Look at his album, it's floppin' again
Not takin' a break, I'm not stoppin' again (yeah, woah, yeah)
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (let's go)
Yeah, what is mine, that is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stackin' this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans
Woah, spent 100,000 on a brand new pointer choker (woah)
Automatic gun's got a motor
I can feel that shit in my shoulder (woah)
Brand new watch cost a quarter
And you know it's flooded in water
You know every day I'm gettin' older
But I'm young enough for your daughter (let's go)
And you know my neck is flooded in boulders (boulders)
Gettin' money, yeah, that's my quota (quota)
Even though Lil Uzi gettin' older (older)
Know I'm young enough for your daughter (yeah)
Every time I'm in my mind, I focus (yeah)
She give me head, hypnosis (yeah)
Talkin' 'bout the love can't hold me (woah)
Talkin' 'bout the guap can't fold me
Uh, talkin' 'bout, "You're mine," no, you don't own me
Yeah, just take your time, and gotta be colder
Yeah, it's on my mind, and they just know me (know me)
Yeah, fast-paced all the time, and I can't slow it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (let's go)
Yeah, what is mine, that is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stackin' this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans (Lil Uzi)
