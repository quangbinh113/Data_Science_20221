Song Name: School Shooters
I drink blood of school shooters
Slit throat, loose screws, get fucked up
Hang his ass from flagpoles with sad souls
The innocent, who the fuck's protecting us?
Boy, you better buckle up
'Cause I got questions for you fucks
I've had enough
Triple X, I just popped a triple X, uh
A school shooter, I just need attention, yeah, uh
Tell the principal, I ain't got no principles
I don't need no school, I got internet, yeah
Kids at school calling me different, yeah
So I'm tryna work on my differences, yeah
Cool kids at school smoke bigarettes
Teens with nicotine or with liquor breath
Or the semi-TEC at school, what's the bigger threat?
Intellect mixed with inner stress
That's a recipe for disaster
If you don't believe me, go ask any chef
School shooter, I just need mental help
Saved by the bell, I can't hear the bell
Give me bad grades, I don't give a F
Get in front of my classmates and kill myself
I drink blood of school shooters
Slit throat, loose screws, get fucked up
Hang his ass from flagpoles with sad souls
The innocent, who the fuck's protecting us?
Boy, you better buckle up
'Cause I got questions for you fucks
I've had enough
Ah, I got a question, where was protection?
How did this happen?
Can we go backwards?
(Can we go backwards? Can we go backwards? Can we go backwards?)
I got a question
I got a question, I got a question, shooter
School shooter, I taught 'em a lesson
Yeah
