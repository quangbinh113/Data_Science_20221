Song Name: Bacc At It Again
Cook that shit up Quay!
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whipping
I'm wrapping again (Whip it)
Keep on playing bitch then I'm stabbing ya friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trapping again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
On my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again (Woo)
Big ole forty on me, back packin' again (Blaow)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)
Quavo
Uhh, back at it, back at it, uhh
Count up a hundred throw racks at it, uhh
Yeah my wrist a Titanic, uhh
Ice hit the glacier, it do damage (Ice)
Uhh, yeah your nigga gon' panic
I see through her panties like a panoramic (Hey)
Yeah now get back to whipping
And get back to trapping
Young nigga back at it (Woo)
Uhh, if it's too crowded might out the roof
And say let them come through (Pow pow)
Keep it one thousand when I'm in the booth
I spent two thousand to step in the shoes (Gang)
Gang on gang how you think we gon' lose (Gang)
Back to back motorcade, that how we move (Woo)
On momma porch was sitting on the stoop (Momma)
When I hopped up I took off to the Moon (Ooh)
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whipping
I'm wrapping again (Whip it)
Keep on playing bitch then I'm stabbing ya friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trapping again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
On my grizzy niggas sta-stacking again (Woo)
Big ole forty on me, back packing again (Blaow)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)
My diamonds like Fiji, bitch, I'm Yella Beezy
Iced-out in this freezer, just copped a Luigi
Oh take it easy, you tripping I'm leaving
My drank in the freezer, this shit don't come easy
I'm trapping I mean it, my blood double G me
The Cougar the heater, take la se√±orita
I'll send some shots through a nigga wife-beater
Chopper knock a nigga out on his people
Don't call me, lil baby, I'm sorry don't need ya
Last month I got shot up, I been win up on features
Body for body my niggas some demons
We tit for tat, leave you busted and bleeding
Stop in Atlanta in the booth with my Nina
Back in the day used to trap in a Beamer
I'm a true hustler my bitch is a schemer
Skeet in her eyes and that lil bitch a creamer (Aye)
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whipping
I'm wrapping again (Whip it)
Keep on playing bitch then I'm stabbing ya friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trapping again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
On my grizzy niggas sta-stacking again (Woo)
Big ole forty on me, back packing again (Blaow) (Huh)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)
Wrist so froze, can't shake hands
I gotta give you a pound
Way my bank account quadrupled
Think I'm still slinging pounds (Wow)
Told them castin' my vote for who tryna get this dope cross the border
Grew up from East Atlanta
But stand my ground like it's Florida
Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff
Fuck the local reporter
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer
Guwop slicker than oil
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith to the trap with the Adler
Look like a Rolls Royce dealership
Every time I bring out my cars
Fuck the stars, buy the bar
Neighborhood superstar (S'Gucci)
Twenty-four K, Bruno Mars
Down to the drawers (Guwop)
I'm thinking' large, talking old money, Chico DeBarge
Lou say I'm 20 futuristic moving this part (S'Gucci)
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whipping
I'm wrapping again (Whip it)
Keep on playing bitch then I'm stabbing ya friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trapping again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
On my grizzy niggas sta-stacking again (Woo)
Big ole forty on me, back packing again (Blaow)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)
