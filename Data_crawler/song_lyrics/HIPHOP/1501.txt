Song Name: Distraction
808 Mafia
Uh
How I go so hard, they still discredit my talent
Took shit too far, now they regretting what happened
Hard for my mama to accept I'm a savage (Uh, uh)
You play, I'm letting you have it (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Them shots let off, that's too much blood for a napkin
They claim we locked in, what if I wasn't rapping?
Fiend for that Ecstasy, couldn't keep from relapsing
Bring out the best of me or be a distraction, uh
If I tell my stepper, "Come and slide," then he coming
And I know it's fucked up how he daily out there hunting
Heartless living, savage life, that's just how he bummin'
But shit, at least it's a nigga I can count on for something, uh
We let them cannons spark, play with us, get punished, uh
We really had it hard, now blessings abundant
Can tell I hit the top, now they can't wait to see me plummet
Like for every win, another L come punch me in my stomach
I couldn't even enjoy my birthday, bitch come to me about assumptions
They can't fuck with me on my worst day,
I done ran it up, all hundreds
Baby, Chiraq is my birthplace, if we got a problem, we slump it
Hard times spent, it's the worst pain and you never get refunded, uh
How I go so hard, they still discredit my talent
Took shit too far, now they regretting what happened
Hard for my mama to accept I'm a savage (Uh, uh)
You play, I'm letting you have it (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Them shots let off, that's too much blood for a napkin
They claim we locked in, what if I wasn't rapping?
Fiend for that Ecstasy, couldn't keep from relapsing
Bring out the best of me or be a distraction, uh, uh
Twin Glocks, Tia Tamera
Yeah, these my new bitches, hit they block with two switches-
It make my shottas shoot different
We can empty out two hunnid shots in less than two minutes
And B' was one of ours, so that shouldn't be a name that you mention
Hope when I'm talkin' you listen 'cause I'm just hoping you get it
I tell my nigga 'bout his self, it ain't got nothing to do with it
And you can't call my phone for help, that's if I heard that you snitching
Don't speak on bodies on your belt, this just ain't how we do business, uh
Bad news turn your whole day tragic
All they heard was that K clapping
Any problem, we stepping up like the crate challenge
Left my heart on that notepad and that still wasn't enough
Lotta snake bites, got low grass, can't feel or trust
How I go so hard, they still discredit my talent
Took shit too far, now they regretting what happened
Hard for my mama to accept I'm a savage (Uh, uh)
You play, I'm letting you have it (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Them shots let off, that's too much blood for a napkin
They claim we locked in, what if I wasn't rapping?
Fiend for that Ecstasy, couldn't keep from relapsing
Bring out the best of me or be a distraction, uh
