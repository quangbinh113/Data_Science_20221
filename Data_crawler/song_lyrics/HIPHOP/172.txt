Song Name: Kamikaze
Ayy, Royce, you did it right here
Ayy, we takin' over 2k18 on my mama, nigga
In the back with my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
With my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
Now I'm in the 'Rari switchin' lanes (Switch lanes)
Pull up to the strip and they all know my name (Know my name)
Now I got this bread and my VV chain swang (VV chain)
I was just broke, steady lookin' for some stains (Some stains)
And my little brother Midget, free my nigga out the cage (Free my man)
Sellin' drugs and I get it out, your bitch, I'm gettin' paid (Gettin' paid)
And I'm in a Masi 'cause I crashed the fucking Range
And I took your bitch 'cause I'm better than your main (Lil' bitch)
In the back with my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
With my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
Yeah, you know I'm in that brand new space coupe (Space coupe)
Hop up out the van like, "Nigga, what it do?" (What it do now?)
I just fucked yo' bitch and then I kick her out my room (Out my room)
And I'm in a fast car, nigga, vroom, vroom (Vroom vroom)
I be wearin' Louis fit down 'cause I flex hard
Posted with my niggas sippin' Wockhardt (Sippin' Wockhardt)
And we don't give a fuck, we got a cold heart (Lil' bitch)
Runnin' through the money, nigga, that part (That part)
In the back with my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
With my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Nigga stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
