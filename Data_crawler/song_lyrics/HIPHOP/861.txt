Song Name: Trillionaire (feat. Youngboy Never Broke Again)
I was so high out my mind, I thought I wasn't gon' see tomorrow
Yeah
Stayin' ten toes down with my head up
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Teezy on the beat (T-T-Teezy on the beat)
Mafia the dream, with these gunshots
I was talkin' to um... I was talkin' to Slime when I seen um...
I think I asked him do he think, do he think I could do somethin'
Then he said, "Bro, you fuckin',
Is you fuckin' crazy?" That nigga said, "Hell yeah"
Then he said some other shit behind it
Reportin' straight out of the slums (Slums)
From rags to riches
I got me some bitches and I changed up how I come (Come)
In a drought when your pockets got mumps
These niggas believing it then
Right on my sack, you know I ain't dumb
Wherever I'm goin', I pull up with something
.38 and they hate it
Where I'm from it's hard make it (Make it)
I never let 'em take it (Take it)
Man guess I was nominated (Woah)
Told the bitch that I'm leavin' so face it (Face it)
Get a new hoe, and have me a baby (Baby)
Out the jungle, I conquered and made it
It still don't feel like I'm famous (Famous)
Feel like they don't feel me now (They don't feel me now), yeah
Fillin' up the stack see me now
(Fillin' up the stack see me now), yeah
I'm steps away, I can't stop now (I can't)
No I won't let you waste my time
Surrounded by some millionnaires (Oh woah)
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire (Oh woah)
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout
Yeah
I'ma be the one that they talk about
I'ma be the one they envy, yeah
Hate it when you made it out the struggle
Love to see a nigga in the trenches (Pluto)
Went to sleep, had a few nightmares
Nigga just left off a mission
All the way paid my dues, dropped out of school, now I'm winning
I had a girl with some red hair, made a nigga feel like Chapo
Just got off the phone with the vato
Know the young nigga gon' kill some
I wanna get me a meal ticket, my young niggas wanna get his murders up
Gotta go get me a million, spend half of it on convertible
Trappin' out the porch, no daddy
Had to go and get mine out the gutter
Came out poor and ashy, now a nigga takin' care of my mother
Wish I had the cure on sickle cell, I hate to see my sister suffer
You can never put a price on how much I love her
Surrounded by some millionnaires (Oh woah)
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire (Oh woah)
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout
Feel like they don't feel me now (They don't feel me now), yeah
Feds stop stunnin' they see me now
(Yeah I'm stunnin' they see me now), yeah
I'm steps away, I can't stop now (I can't)
No I won't let you waste my time (Yeah)
The bezel out the gutter, yeah, yeah
Fell in love with my Cartier, yeah, yeah
Go to war 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
I'll kill 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
Used to sleep on the floor, yeah, yeah
Used to kick in the door, yeah, yeah
I finesse with the bros, yeah, yeah
