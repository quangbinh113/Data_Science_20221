Wide Body (skrrt), turn off the track get nasty when I snap
Got that get back (back), smoke on po nasty
Turnt him to a pack (a pack)
I stand on wax (wax) keep playing with Nuski
Watch some else get whacked (get whacked)
Can't lie I cried (cried)
Wiping my tears loading up that drac' (that drax')
Tears falling, hoping the clip don't catch my DNA (my DNA)
I'm spazzing out (Out) like fuck this switch
He gotta feel this K (this K)
It's Friday night, on his block late, got a show the next day
You got me lost (lost), you pissed me off
Let them pussies get off (get off)
Me vs me, (thirtball)
I'm stuck between being a shooter or a boss
I'm cracking seals (wock')
While shedding tears like ago a dry cough (what, what?)
And we put shit under (under)
It's only right I put you in that wall (In that wall)
I fiend murder (murder)
These niggas know I mean murder (murder, nurder)
Ever catch me loafing (murder, murder)
Cut me open I bleed murder (murder)
Black Draco century arms (brrr)
Flipping shit like a cheeseburger (brrr, brrr)
We heavily armed (Armed)
Can't name a chopper we ain't heard of (brrr)
My bitch by my side
Through thick and thin don't want for nothin' (know what I'm sayin'?)
I'ma get it together ('gether)
Stop the bullshit cut out the pluggin' (brrr)
'Cause I can't even stomach
Just the thought of my lil bitch fucking
And she know how I get
Bout the smallest shit it get ugly (get ugly)
Lord knows I love my kids (kids)
About Ashton got at the preacher (preacher)
Bout Realan take out the teacher (the teacher)
Play with Riley and meet the reaper (the reaper)
Don't play bout Camille and Neesha (At all)
Same shit go for Talisha (On God)
Bout big Ross and you the God

I got seven (seven) cars, seven chains dead aim (brrr)
Pop out (Out), racks on me, Celine frames (frames)
