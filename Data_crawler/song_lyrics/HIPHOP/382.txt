Song Name: Now or Never 2.0
Tell me why did you leave so fast
Tell me why does it hurt so bad
Why you had to spread your wings so fast
I'll never leave you in the past, no
They killed my dog today
It's crazy nigga took my dog away
So I'm going hard today
'Cause for me, you would be a call away
It's raining hard today
These tear drops, they keep fallin', ayy
I got to watch for my enemies
'Cause I know that they be trying to get rid of me
They trying to steal all my energy
Plottin' and schemin, they trying to put an end to me
Know it's some people around me right now
They ain't right, they be moving too finicky
You act like I owe you or something
Lil nigga, I'm starting to peep all your tendencies
But when I was down and when I was out
I couldn't call you, is you kidding me
Nowadays I don't even breeze through
Love my hood, but fuck it, I don't really need to
'Cause they killed my dog, they killed apart of me too
Now it's a hole in my heart everybody can see through
Tell me why did you leave so fast (Did you leave so fast)
Would you mind if I hold your hand (If I hold your hand)
Everybody is afraid of leaving
I'll never leave never
Love is now or never
Tell me why did you leave so fast (Did you leave so fast)
Would you mind if I hold your hand (If I hold your hand)
Trapstar, popstar
Locked up, cop car
Bailed out
Crazy how I feel though like I'm in jail now
Room full of bitches and I swear I can't tell now
I don't want lil bitch, I just want to be by myself now
I feel all alone inside this world, girl can't you tell
They say I sold my sold, bitch I don't have a soul to sell
Even though I'm winning, I been taking all these L's now
The odds are all against me, It's like they want me to fail now
Two bean, I been up for two days
Trying to figure out, why the good got to die young
I'm trying to figure out
Why we always gotta fall victim to the system
Nick, give me some more volume, gotta pour my feelings out
Yeah, I know it took awhile, but I think I get it now
A lot of niggas took my style, but I swear it's different now
But they trying to take me out so I keep a stick around
Tell me why did you leave so fast (Did you leave so fast)
Would you mind if I hold your hand (If I hold your hand)
Everybody is afraid of leaving
I'll never leave never
Love is now or never
Tell me why did you leave so fast (Did you leave so fast)
Would you mind if I hold your hand (If I hold your hand)
Now or never
Now or never
