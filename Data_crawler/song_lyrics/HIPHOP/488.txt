Song Name: Touch The Stars (feat. Lil Tjay)
Woah, Kenny
Ah, ah, ah, ayy
I'm so high right now, think I could touch the stars
Ah, ah, ah, ayy
You came into my life and then it fell apart, ayy
Ah, oh, oh
All these drugs for me and you, babe, we can go to Mars
Yeah, drunk in love, this junkie love, you my lil' Xanny bar
And if we ever overdose, that's a new start
Pussy feel so good, might tat' my name on that ho, huh
Real street nigga, I ain't buyin' a thing for these hoes, huh
Yeah, I might change for you though, hmm, huh, ayy
I might put a ring on this ho, ayy (Yeah, yeah)
Red, purple, mixin' dope, wet pussy, deep throat
Cold ass nigga sippin' cola, I don't do the Coke
Put them diamonds on my bride
Crushed ice on me, shit lookin' like shards
Only one I want 'cause these other bitches odd
Deep up in the pussy, got her screaming, "Oh my God, yeah, oh my God"
That shit wet, swim in it like a shark (Oh)
Got a chopstick on me like a dart (Rrr-rrr)
With a badass lil' bitch, but she don't bark (Roof, roof)
Got that bankroll on me, this shit a wad (Bitch)
All for one, one for all, this for the squad
Don't pray for love 'cause that love'll leave you scarred
Ah, ah, ah, ayy (Yeah)
I'm so high right now, think I could touch the stars
Ah, ah, ah, ayy
You came into my life and then it fell apart, ayy
Ah, oh, oh
All these drugs for me and you, babe, we can go to Mars
Yeah, drunk in love, this junkie love, you my lil' Xanny bar
And if we ever overdose, that's a new start
No matter what, you know I'm finna do my thing
I'm focused on myself and I don't care 'bout what you think
My bitch got a fat ass, I'm so deadass, her pussy pink
I bent it over, bent it over, killed it on the scene
That bitch could line me up so I be careful what I lean
I gotta watch my cup, that bitch could put somethin' in my drink
I don't care 'bout no thottie, they ain't do nothing for me
They don't want me to succeed, they chasin' me for my cheese
And I know they can't believe a youngin from 83
Made it to the next level, but further, I'm 'posed to be
No longer, I gotta scheme, blue faces up in my jeans
Extended clip with a beam, I finish you on the scene, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ayy
I'm so high right now, think I could touch the stars
Ah, ah, ah, ayy
You came into my life and then it fell apart, ayy
Ah, oh, oh
All these drugs for me and you, babe, we can go to Mars
Yeah, drunk in love, this junkie love, you my lil' Xanny bar
And if we ever overdose, that's a new start
