Song Name: Niagara Falls
We done did a lot around the law
I done did so much, I wish I saw
I been up and down that bitch before
I been up and down that bitch before
Had it in my heart and in my cards
I been up and down that
Ratchet bitches want a friend, she's not friendly (ah)
That's the type to put me in my mood
She know that I'm mobbin', she come cool for me
She know how to put me in my groove
I know it's a lot that you can learn from me
It's just one thing that you gotta prove
If you gotta walk would you still ride for me?
I might need a extra for the two
Gotta keep my distance, they surroundin' me
I might need a extra for the two
They might have to go and build a house for me
I might need a extra for the
We done did so much around the law
Stay up to forget 'bout what I saw
Powers keep increasin' by the bar
Shit don't make you sleepy after all
Shoppin' in my closet not the mall
Openin' my mouth, a disco ball
I extend the marble on my wall
I been into this, I need it all, all, all
Water down the ice, Niagara Falls
Got too many numbers we could call
Made too many ways for you to cross
Now we lookin' down and then we ball, ball, ball
Ratchet bitches want a friend, she's not friendly (ah)
That's the type to put me in my mood (yeah)
She know that I'm mobbin', she come cool for me (ah, ah)
She know how to put me in my groove (yeah)
I know it's a lot that you can learn from me (ooh)
It's just one thing that you gotta prove (ah, ah)
If you gotta walk would you still ride for me? Aah, ah)
I might need a extra for the two (ah, ah, oh)
Gotta keep my distance, they surroundin' me (ooh)
I might need a extra for the two (ooh)
They might have to go and build a house for me (ooh)
I might need a extra for the (ooh)
Crib same size as the galleria
Spanish model with me, call her senorita
I done fell in love with a hood girl
She be puttin' syrup in her margaritas
Bought my college vibe a brand new Birkin
On the weekend she be twerkin'
Take a shower in the Maybach, it got curtains
Leave your phone in your purse, you're makin' me nervous
Saint Laurent Don fresher than detergent
Got a crush on this waitress ho, she serve me
Porsche headlights on, Kermit the Frog
Michael Vick, number seven, I'm a dawg
Ratchet bitches want a friend, she's not friendly (ah)
That's the type to put me in my mood (yeah)
She know that I'm mobbin', she come cool for me (ah, ah)
She know how to put me in my groove (yeah)
I know it's a lot that you can learn from me (ooh)
It's just one thing that you gotta prove (ah, ah)
If you gotta walk would you still ride for me? (Ah, ah)
I might need a extra for the two (ah, ah, oh)
Gotta keep my distance, they surroundin' me (ooh)
I might need a extra for the two (ooh)
They might have to go and build a house for me (ooh)
I might need a extra for the (ooh)
