Song Name: Jet Lag (feat. Young Scooter)
I just got a juug, I just got a juug, juug, juug
I just called the plug (Uh), I just called the plug, plug, plug
These niggas flodgin', these niggas flodgin', these niggas flodgin'
Ayy, let's go
I take off, no jet lag (I take off)
Spend that shit, then make it back (Spend that shit)
I just may walk up in Saks
50 bands in a bag (50 bands)
I got a hundred, double that (I got a hundred)
Big old gun in a duffel bag
Still got niggas on the block, yeah
If we go broke, it's back to that
I would juug all day (Juug all day) just to
Keep the lights on (Just to keep the lights on)
I would juug all day (Juug all day),
Every day I was tryna get (Every day)
Good all ways, all work, no play, just juug
I can't fuck you right now, no I gotta juug
Poppin' me up, drugs
Got a bad bitch like Meagan Good
Choppa long like a golf club
Hold that bitch like Tiger Woods
Fuck your bitch, I might as well
I heard that her pussy good
Aww, ride in the Range, ride in the Rover
I'm switchin' lanes, losing composure
Rollie on me, no tick-tick-tick-tick, you know your time is over
Gun in the bag, it go shh-shh-shh, you know it's a silence on it
Money machine, it go tick-tick-tick-tick-tick, keep your composure
My niggas brazy as hell, shoot up your spot and laugh
I take off, no jet lag
Spend that shit, then make it back
I just may walk up in Saks
50 bands in a bag
I got a hundred, double that
Big old gun in a duffel bag (Big old gun)
Still got niggas on the block, yeah (Still got niggas)
If we go broke, it's back to that
I would juug all day (Juug all day) just
To keep the lights on (Keep the lights on)
I would juug all day (Juug all day),
Everyday I was tryna get (Every day)
Good all ways, all work, no play, just juug
I can't fuck you right now, no I gotta juug
I'm the Juug King
Got a million dollars worth of Aliante on everything
Half of these rappers be fake,
I know 'cause niggas got fake chains (Pussy)
I cook dope on beats so every verse I write cocaine
And I don't ride waves, I ride cars and airplanes
I take off, no jet lag
Lost half a mil' and juuged it back
I sell pounds out trash bags
Wrapped my money in saran wrap
You own your block, yeah that's cap
How you a boss and sellin' sacks?
Street get money like 16 ways
So nigga I don't depend on rap
Ayy, skrr, skrr
Can I get a little skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr
I'm cookin' dope
Skrr, skrr
Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr
I'm the mothafuckin' GOAT
I take off, no jet lag
Spend that shit, then make it back
I just may walk up in Saks
50 bands in a bag
I got a hundred, double that
Big old gun in a duffel bag
Still got niggas on the block, yeah
If we go broke, it's back to that
I would juug all day just to keep the lights on
I would juug all day, everyday I was tryna get
Good all ways, all work, no play, just juug
I can't fuck you right now, no I gotta juug
I just got a juug, I just got a juug, juug, juug
I just called the plug, I just called the plug, plug, plug
Fuckin' up the racks in Saks Fifth
Space coupe, it came with a pink slip
The Goyard filled with blue strips
Spend the chips like a big pimp
Takin' a Wraith, not no jet lag
I put Chanel on my bitch purse
I'm takin' off with her Hermès
All through the door, call her Birkin
Richard Mille ain't got no tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Go and spend it all, ain't no worry
Got the whole world drinkin' dirty (Dirty)
That's your old girl, then we splurgin' (Splurge)
Perfectin' my job and it's new goals
Certified stones on my new ho
All solid, all solid stones
Cuban link on my collarbone
Skeleton AP, the two-tone
I wear it at night, turn the lights off
I take off on the jet, nigga
With a hundred bands and a TEC, nigga
I take off, no jet lag
Spend that shit, then make it back
I just may walk up in Saks
50 bands in a bag
I got a hundred, double that
Big old gun in a duffel bag
Still got niggas on the block, yeah
If we go broke it's back to that
I would juug all day just to keep the lights on
I would juug all day, everyday I was tryna get (Juug)
Good all ways, all work, no play, just juug
I can't fuck you right now, no I gotta juug
Juugin' all day, just to keep the lights on
Juugin' all day, every day
Juugin' all day, keep the lights on
Juugin' all day, every day
