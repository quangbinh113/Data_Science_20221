Song Name: Dying
When it comes to drugs
Pill pushers and takers
We are a country virtually out of control
If you are feeling depressed
To get relief, take a pill
Most of us are addicts
Life gets hard sometimes, I know
So I be leaning, I'll be smoking my dope
I see your face everywhere that I go
It's the only thing that reminds me of home
I be with my team racing whips, on the roll
Rolling off a bean that I took at the show
Young limousine I'm a backseat rider
She only calls my phone, when she thinks that I'm dying
Baby you're the one for me, that's for sure
I just need your company, so ride slow
This ain't what you want from me, so cold
Girl you're the only one for me, I know
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'm leaving with you
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'm leaving with you
I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you
(I'll leave with you)
Cold heart, baby
Gothboiclique
Yeah she asking me
What are we
I'm like what you mean
(What you mean)
I'm smoking gasoline with my team
GBC
They'll be there with me
And I know I ain't shit
But you're a master piece
Kurt Cobain jeans
You're my Courtney Love
Thraxxl Rose how I got the club going up
Taking bars for anxiety
Smoking kush is my therapy
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'm leaving with you
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'm leaving with you
I'll leave with you
(I'll leave with you)
A lot of people have seen their friends die
I don't want anyone
To see any of their friends die anymore
