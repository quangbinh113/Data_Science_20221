Song Name: Glitches (feat. G Herbo)
Come on
(Dmac on the fuckin' track)
I see everybody tryna be switch gang and shit like that
Everybody wanna put a switch on they shit
You know what I'm sayin'? We the niggas really got them switches, man (Danny, I see you)
Glitches
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
We got- (grree, uh)
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
(Switches)
We got Glocks, we got chops, we threw switches on 'em (switch)
Lil' bro squeezin', it ain't stop, he got to glitchin' on 'em (grree, grree)
This bitch ate me, almost died, she took my soul away from me (she took my soul away from me)
Ask the last opp how he died, we took his soul away from him (come on)
We took his soul from him (huh)
They still ain't get back (they still ain't get back)
Switches load up in two halves, look like a Kit-Kat (look like a Kit-Kat)
Get off the internet (huh)
No, we ain't with that (no, we ain't with that)
How you braggin' 'bout them killings and y'all ain't did that? Huh, huh (and y'all ain't did that)
Glitches

Ayy (switches, yeah)
Grrah, grrah, grrah, frr (bitch)
Yeah, that's how they sound (brr)
We got them switches around (around)
That's when you know drenchers around (get down now)
Before we was puttin' niggas on, we used to put shit down (you know that)
Get down or lay down, we'll come flip your town (No Limit)
I use to be scared of them switches, think they'd bring out the fed in a nigga
Always had faith in my nickel, I know it'll take off the head of a nigga (boom)
Lot of cash, but bro still'll pass it, know I'ma only see red when I get it (let's get it)
My lil' ho in the A, she be callin' me bae, but I only want head when I'm with her (swerv')
Glitches
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
We got- (grree, uh)
We got glitches (switches)
We got glitches (switches)
(Switches)
