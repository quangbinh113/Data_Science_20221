Song Name: Finer Things
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gone do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dying and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past grinding for a new life
Hard headed I grew up resilient
It wasn't no heroes, so we look up to the villains
For generations, bitch, my side of town been drillin'
We been at war ever since them red buildings
It's hard to make peace once blood get to spillin', ayy
Lil Wooski get to shootin' like he filming
Yeah, my friends died too, I know that feeling
I'm popping ecstasy to help me with the healing
Leah and lil baby my younger siblings
I really love them, so I treat em' like my children
Laylani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
I switch my swag up, can't you tell the difference?
I'm finna feed the whole gang with these millions
I'm finna buy my whole hood with these millions
Girl, if I give you my time, that's a prilvage
But I can only give my heart to the realest
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gone do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dying and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grinding for a new life
Lately, I've been feeling like fuck the street, this shit a scam
These days, if it ain't bout money, I don't give a damn
I'm just gone get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on instagram
Still with the gang though, one false move them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say that look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughing
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxing
She say she like how I be swaggin', she love my fashion
VVS my diamonds, my jewelry flashin'
Drip so hard, I'm makin' puddles, bitch, my Gucci splashin'
Fresh the death like my closet in a casket
Fresh the death like my closet in a casket
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gone do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dying and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grinding for a new life
Ayy, grinding for a new life
Grinding for a new life
Grinding for a new life, ayy
