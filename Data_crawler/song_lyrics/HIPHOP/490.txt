Song Name: You Don't Love Me (feat. Juice Wrld)
Yeah, I do what I wanna
Blunts of the strong marijuana
If I die tell my Momma I'm a stoner
Do what I wanna
Always smell that aroma
Started young now I'm feeling older
Do what I wanna
I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare (Yeah, I do what I wanna)
No you don't love me, yeah
No you don't love me, yeah (Yeah, I do what I wanna)
Not losing the time, no, no, not again
I know that this money is my only friend
I know that these drugs finna do me in
But I'ma do them anyway
I know I sin, sin, sin
Don't got no regrets, yes, yes
I'ma live the best, best, best
'Til I lay to rest, rest, rest
Percocet keep from all my pain
Xanny umbrella
Yeah, I hate the rain
Going through the cycle yet again
Time don't stop, no, I know, not for no man
I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare
No you don't love me, yeah
No you don't love me, yeah
I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
You just stop and stare, stop and stare
No you don't love me, yeah
You hate me, is that right?
Ayy, caught up in the fast life
I'ma do the dash while I pass life
You hate me, is that right?
Better stand up and act right
I'm living in the fast life
I'ma do the dash when I pass life
You hate me, is that right?
Better stand up
Better act right
Fuck 12, they just let my bro home
Looking in his trap phone, all these unknowns
Shorty finna let me out the friend zone
Yeah, I do what I wanna
Blunts of the strong marijuana
If I die tell my Momma I'm a stunna
Do what I wanna
Always smell the aroma
Started young now I'm feeling older
Do what I wanna
I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare (Yeah, I do what I wanna)
No you don't love me, yeah
No you don't love me, yeah (Yeah, I do what I wanna)
