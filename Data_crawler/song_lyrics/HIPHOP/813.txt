Song Name: Love You (feat. Sydny August)
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
When we fight, can't let the world know
Don't tell the group chat or let your girls know
They be happy to see you down
They be happy to see you down
And my heart cold, but you heat it up
Get you to the crib, lick it, beat it up
Real power couple winnin', they can't compete with us
Can't no one fuck this up 'cause this too deep with us
But I love you
That's why I'm into you
My baby, oh
(Oh)
That's why I'm into you
My wifey, yeah, yeah
That's why I'm into you
But I love you, but I love you
You stepped into a boss situation
Turnt up with the young generation
Tryna give you dick, you can't take it
Treat you like a virgin, you can taste it
Please don't tell your friends my business
Want you to be my girl, no friendship
I gave her the code to the mansion
Want me to suck her toes, she demand it
Oh, ice out her pendant
Put a Rollie on her left wrist
I don't condone to no abortions
Why you ain't keep it? (Oh)
I ain't never been in love this deep, you know what I'm sayin'? (Oh, oh)
Like my past, my past, know what I'm sayin'? I regret it (Oh, oh)
But I think we made for each other, for real (Oh, oh)
Never takin' love for granted
Many die young before they have this
Not too many of 'em growin' up and never had it (Oh, oh)
So that's why with you it's a habit, we classic (Oh, woah, oh)
You the realest so I make it a point to match that
Every bitch from your past, try hard to snatch back
Give me all your kids and fuck me good so I can snapback
You the type to say that if I want it, I could bag, bag
Deserve it all 'cause you be gettin' to it
You deserve a bitch that'll hold you down through it (Oh, oh)
I know your body, you ain't never gotta prove it (Yeah)
You know what you're doin', I know what to do it with it (With it)
Let's take it to a new limit (Limit)
You know you're too smooth with it
So come through, I'ma show you
How we gon' move (How we gon' move)
So come through, I'ma show you (I'ma show you, I'ma show you)
So come through, I'ma show you (I'ma show you, I'ma show you)
So come through, I'ma show you (I'ma show you, I'ma show you)
So come through, I'ma show you (I'ma show you, I'ma show you)
