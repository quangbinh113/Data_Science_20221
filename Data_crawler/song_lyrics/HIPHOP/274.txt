Bad lil' bitches and they tryna get busy
Don't call my phone if they ain't tryna get litty
Spent 30K 'cause I had to get drippy
Just one chain on my neck cost fifty (Ice)
All these new blue hundreds, they crispy
Walk in the club and I got my glizzy

And shit disappear like a ghost (Skrrt)
I got the streets on my back, yeah
I'm fresh out the trap, I be givin' them hope (Hope)
Spent ten bands on a coat (Coat)

Niggas drown with the wave, can you float?

Nigga say he fucked my bitch, I'm like, which one?
All these hoes out there, nigga, pick one
Stealin' my swag, yeah I'm where you get your drip from
You know I stay in designe
