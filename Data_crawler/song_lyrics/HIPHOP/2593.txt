Song Name: Not For Nothing (feat. Anderson .Paak)
(Maybach Music)
Another Maybach experience
Not for nothing, not for no reason (huh)
Gotta be something keeps my heart beating
Show no weakness, not for no reason (AP, Young Renzel)
Something's got me believing (yo)
I can be the man someday (I can be the one)
I can hold your hand in a public place
I can get your bag, briefcase
But what's the use of that?
When all you want is time with a nigga
And that's not something I can deliver
And you just keep reminding a nigga
But, for some reason, I can't remember
Not for nothing, not for no reason
Gotta be something keeps my heart beating
Show no weakness, not for no reason (uh)
Something's got me believing (yes)
(Maybach music)
Champagne showers all summer
Took you shopping in London
Know that time cost us money (uh)
Diamonds come in abundance
Took you backstage for shotty
I just want you to love me
What we have is so gangster (uh)
I'll put nothin' above it (huh)
Uh, you're my girl, and I miss your red feathers and curls
Wanna kiss you (uh)
The diamonds don't lay (yes)
Player don't be lying this way (uh)
Cribs in middle of Phoenix (woo)
Shawty's stance is the meanest
Got a duffle bag of money, I just thought I should bring it (boss)
You deserve your desires (boss)
I'm just flamin' your fire (boss)
Show me your true potential, really that's all I require (huh)
We both made up of flaws (yes)
I might suffer withdrawals
We might go through some things, but won't get a divorce (no)
Shawty takin' my charge as I pray to my Lord (Lord)
I will lay down my life (life)
Anything and she know it
When all you want is time with a nigga
And that's not something I can deliver
And you just keep remindin' a nigga
But, for some reason, I can't remember
Not for nothin', not for no reason (spiritual wealth)
Gotta be something keeps my heart beatin'
(And you one of the reasons I'm richer than I ever been)
Show no weakness, not for no reason (uh)
Something's got me believin' (yes)
(Maybach music)
Nice, Paris, in France, take a pack of your friends
All in, hop in, and we not stopping until we hit Cannes
Glad you gave me that chance (yes), now look who your man (yes)
Newest ornamented a Birkin, that came straight from the lab (boss)
We not moving too fast, all we wanted was time (time)
All I wanted was yours (yours), all you wanted was mine (mine)
As we holding each other, pray the Sun, it will shine
We both come with each other or come one at a time (woo)
All the time that we share (huh), which is truly a plus (huh)
All the things that we cherish (yes), which is truly a, "Us"
All these moments are golden (golden), got the AP to match (match)
Sprinkled stones is a bonus (ha-ha-ha), tell them hoes to relax (woo)
Only things that's for certain (certain), cop it if it's for some purchase
Every heartbeat is priceless (yes) until it's a burden
So, if you in love say want me to call (what)
Go twist you a blunt and say this was so
When all you want is time with a nigga
And that's not something I can deliver
And you just keep remindin' a nigga
But, for some reason, I can't remember
I can be your man someday (Maybach music)
I can hold your hand in a public place
I can get your bag, briefcase
But what's the use of that?
