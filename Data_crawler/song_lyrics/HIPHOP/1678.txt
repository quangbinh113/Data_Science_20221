Song Name: Heartbreaker
You break my heart, this glass half full
Pick me apart you think its cool
I work so hard all this for you
But you don't care, you never do
So how I can reach you then
What can I say to make you see
Is there something that's in your heard or is it simply just me
I can be everything or nothing if you please
That's what she wants to say but emotions make her weak
Tell me you see me (tell me you see me)
I'll tell you to prove it (I'll tell you to prove it)
Your heartbeat races mine (Your heartbreak races mine)
Its beautiful music (Its beautiful music)
You break my heart, this glass half full
Pick me apart you think its cool
I work so hard all this for you
But you don't care, you never do
