Song Name: Boink Boink (feat. Rich The Kid, VV$ Ken)
Let's go Mario
Soon as that beat knock in, I get offended, I get to makin' a face
Lambo', new drop, 'Rari outside, uh, uh, I put the Wraith on a break
Just got brand new keys (vroom), uh, makin' my way on a Jake
Fuckboy talkin' that tough shit
Talkin' that fuck shit that he won't say to my face
Put a lil' twist in the Fanta
White bitch suckin' my dick in Atlanta
Did it so good I had to go get the camera
Ain't no MC but she gon' get this hammer
She won't get nothin' from me, I ain't Santa
Hannah Montana
I get that coochie a Gucci bandana
Took it right back like Shaq, I knew that coochie was slammin', uh
All red jacket like Thriller
Feelin' like uh, hit me (oh)
All the jack boys can't stand 'em
Ask no questions, I ain't doin' no panel
I just walk out thе mall with the bands
I just don't need to call out, I'm tag
I'm just calling up (oh)
So she can witnеss the check when I sign and say, "Ah"
I heard you payin' to fuck her
If I pull up, I promise she fuckin' for free
I'm finna fuck her then duck her, then send her back to you
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I might just fuck her and dip
Uh, I got the stacks and they tucked to the tee
Shawty be touchin' on me
Ridin' and climbin', and suckin' and touchin' on D
I just got D and no love for a freak
She got a fee but I ain't payin' no fee
I come to fuck and she spray it on me
Bitch don't be playin' no games with me, woo
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (uh-uh)
Walked inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (uh-uh)
Walked inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee
Gucci down, rockin' my denim
Baby keep suckin', she pullin' my venom
I'm 'bout to bust it (bah), after I'm nuttin', don't touch it
.40 on me, I'ma pipe, I don't clutch it (grrr, grrr)
Shawty ain't fuckin' then fuck it, I know her man drive a bucket
I'm sendin' shots, better duck it, I know you fuck niggas puppets
Seen me pull up I'ma up it
See me pull off I done did it (damn)
Moncler coat came fitted (phew)
Thought I was lackin', that fuckboy shitted
You know I'm packin', lil' hoe, I'm with it
Ten on fleek, too turnt up, I'm geeked
Poppin', ain't comin' out weak
I just been shoppin', ain't comin' out cheap
Blue hunnids droppin', they comin' out neat
Shawty a freak (yeah), I watch her suck it, I peep
He better hide when I see
He better slide when I'm geeked (grr, grr, grr)
I know her pussy get wet when I motherfuckin' speak
Scammin' all week, runnin' shit, brand new cleats
Pretty bitch, brand new minks
New crib, brand new sinks
That hoe was ugly, I found me a brand new link
I'ma just bust in her face
Red bottoms, them don't come with no lace (red bottom)
Kill the pussy, bitch I'm beatin' the case
Quarter milli', took it right out the safe
Soon as I pull out, the Lambo' swervin' (swervin')
Ten bitches stuff 'em in a suburban
F' in her rib, I know that for certain
Bought the Rolls truck and then I added the curtains (skrr)
I'ma buy brand new link (link)
Dirty Sprite, I keep the cup on pink (on pink)
She was bad, she got a brand new mink (mink)
My wrist on water like a brand new sink (water, water, water, water)
Lamborghini on suicide
Hollywood, I'm gettin' top while I drive (while I drive)
Chopper on me, know I'm keepin' the fire
Hunnid racks on me, why would I lie? (Rich)
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (uh-uh)
Walked inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (uh-uh)
Walked inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee (frisbee)
