Song Name: Lift Me Up
Mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah
Lift me up, lift me up
Hallelujah (hallelujah)
Yeah, lift me up, lift me up
Hallelujah (Lord, lift me up)
Okay
Half a mill' posted in Bel Air lobby
Yeah, fuckin' with a star, think she somebody
I like her real sweet, thotty and a little snobby
I like to rap, but gettin' hoes is my real hobby
Yeah, money and the chase, chasin' don't stop it
I need the gross, same number as the profit
She want a nigga who gon' lock her, got a lot of options
How she fallin' in love, I ain't even pop yet? (Bro)
I pay extra for the big body (body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot toddy
Bless me, got the money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me, but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up
Lift me up, lift me up, got the engine in trunk
I need hunnid on two, and I need one on the pump
S-s-second to none and I'm Neo, the one
Your, your life just begun, and I do this for fun
Fakin' that flex on the 'Gram, nigga, stop it
You took my style, had a baby, adopted it
Why would I lie when it's facts that you copied it?
Heard your new shit, floppy this (bro)
I pay extra for the big body (body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot toddy
Bless me, got the money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me, but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up
Lift me up, lift me up, ultrabeam on the watch
High speed in the drop, and her hand on my crotch
Yes, sweepstake shawty, she could win the jackpot
Yeah, straight to the top, man, that pussy top notch
For certified banger, last ten summers
Do what I want, I can have if I want her
Yeah, I might like, but I don't really love her
These hoes ain't loyal, gotta use a rubber (bro)
I pay extra for the big body (body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot toddy
Bless me, got the money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up
Lift me up, lift me up (lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (hallelujah)
Lord, lift me up
Hallelujah
Lord, lift me up
