Song Name: !
Exclamation mark, exclamation mark, exclamation mark
Exclamation mark, exclamation mark
Damn, that shit hurt, bae
That shit hurt in the worst way
Why'd we fight in the first place?
Always mad on a Monday
Mind on a runway
I see you wanna run 'way
Sometimes I wanna run away, yeah
I can't keep focusing on anybody
I have to focus on myself
I can't keep focusing on anybody
In order to get closer to myself
Hurt, hurt, ayy
In order to get closer to myself
Hurt, hurt, ayy
In order to get closer to myself
Damn, that shit hurt, bae
Damn, that shit hurt, bae
That shit hurt in the worst ways
Why'd we fight in the first place?
Man, that shit hurt, bae
Always mad on a monday
And my mind on a runway
Sometimes I wanna run away
I can't keep focusing on anybody
I have to focus on myself
I can't keep focusing on anybody
In order to get closer to myself
Hurt, hurt, ayy
In order to get closer to myself
Hurt, hurt, ayy
In order to get closer to myself
