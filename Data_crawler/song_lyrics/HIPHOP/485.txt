Song Name: Letter To Nipsey (feat. Roddy Ricch)
Yeah
I just left your viewing at the Staples Center (I did)
Obama wrote you a letter, yeah, you made it nigga (You made it)
I even heard you had some players to come to Vegas with us
And them suckers could never kill you, it only made you bigger (Yeah)
And every time I see some fire I see blue
And every time I close my eyes, see Snupe and I see you
When I be on the West side (West side), you know how we do (How we do)
Hustle and motivate, turning one into a two (Two, two), two into four
Hurt my heart, I seen you on the floor, do it for the hood
And I don't even wanna do it no more
When these niggas you do it for, they'll shoot you and all
The only thing I can say is you with the Lord, blessings (Blessings)
And I ain't finna say it like I'm your main homie (I won't)
But when we lost you it really put some pain on me (It did)
Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me (Brrt)
And when them niggas went against me
You ain't change on me (You ain't change on me)
Told me it was wrong or righ,t some of my longest nights (You do)
You made me cry nigga (Cry nigga), and I don't cry nigga (Cry nigga)
You the first one made me feel like
I could die nigga (Like I could die)
Cause real niggas never die,
You know the vibes nigga (You know the vibes nigga, yeah)
Couple days ago was chilling with my youngins
Seeing your kids on the 'Gram
It made me sicker to my stomach (It made me sick)
And as the marathon continue, we keep running (We won't stop)
But I like "Damn,
I wish you seen that pussy coming, for real" (For real)
I wish I knew when the storm came (Storm came)
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, woah, woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah (Brother), woah, woah, woah
Had to stand through these tears
'Cause I see you every time my eyes close
Asking myself why you had to go
But only God knows (Only God knows, woah)
I was in Miami when I lost you, I ain't talk about it (Yeah)
I remember I bawled out in tears when I saw your body (Mm)
In a flight back home, had cold days in LA (Hm)
Had to turn off my phone, throw on the shades and meditate
What you 'bout wishin' goin' blind, to hide your tears?
Had a lot of murder on my mind, but in God I fear
Took y'all all around the globe in a year (Woah)
'Member ridin' solo, now it's Escalades on my rear (Woah)
I just hustle, motivate, be prolific, hold down the state
My big brother Hussle the great
I know Kyrie, Supreme relate, I know Jay Rock, Hoggie relate
Black Sam, Adam relate, Key to Jay, Stone relate
Laurent pack, man, it's love, I wanna see you, but
I wish I knew when the storm came (Storm came)
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, woah, woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah (Brother), woah, woah, woah
Had to stand through these tears
'Cause I see you every time my eyes close
Asking myself why you had to go
But only God knows (Only God knows, woah)
