Song Name: Ex Bitch
Hey, hey, hey
I just fucked my ex, bitch
Pull up on the next, bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I could be your daddy, bitch
Got big legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the addy, bitch
Know your daddy proud of you
Real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey
So where we go
As we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
So where we go
As we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
Hey, hey
I just fucked my ex, bitch
Pull up on the next, bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I could be your daddy, bitch
Got big legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the addy, bitch
Know your daddy proud of you
Real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable
Hey, hey
So where we go
As we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?

So where we go
As we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
