Song Name: wanna grow old (i won't let go)
Yeah
I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, oh
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
Now I put the blade down, darlin'
I wanna see the light of the mornin'
I was stuck inside the yesterdays
Seditive ease the pain on my wrist
I put the blade down, darling, oh
I stood in the dark wishin' the end was near
Now I found my heart, and I know I have worth, yeah
So I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, oh
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
