A bitch like me, yeah, I know my worth
Fuckin' with me is a gift and a curse (ah)
Ayy, I pay my own rent
Ain't no nigga sleepin' over puttin' me in my place (me in my place)
Nigga, be grateful, you should be thankful you even get to brеathe in a real bitch space
I got that Hеllcat, skrrt off on a nigga soon as I get off his face (skrrt, skrrt)
Nigga, don't put one hand on this frontal 'less you can afford to replace this lace
Dropped a bag on my purse, hm, purse, hm, purse (yeah)
That El Chapo, this that work, hm, work, hm, work
Fix your face, bitch, you hurt, hm, hurt, hm, hurt (ah)

Ayy, shout out to my pussy, this lil' bitch the G.O.A.T
And a honorable mention to my throat (to my throat)
All dicks, please rise, let's praise the ass
And all my real freak hoes, let's fuck some more (ah)
My motherfuckin' body, my choice (my choice)
Ain't no lil' dick takin' my voice
Crazy how y'all be the first ones tuned in listenin'
But claim I ain't makin' no noise (ha, ha, ha)
Hoes go under the knife, still ain't cut like me
Cowgirl hat, still can't buck like me
I done switched my shit, like, four, five times (four, five times)
None of these hoes get nails done like me (ah)
Call him when it's something I don't wanna pay for (pay for)
He's scared to spend it on me 'cause he know I'm player
But I'ma ride that dick so motherfuckin' good
Have him come to the spirits like a seánce (ah)
He like when I ride that, ride that, ride that, uh (ride that, uh)
Pick it up, throw it back, drop that shit (drop that shit)
Never go back and forth with a nigga (yeah)
Way too pretty, gotta stop that shit (stop that shit)
I'm lit off Casamigos ('gos)
My pretty white toes (toes)
My natural afro (yeah)
My neck and wrist froze, yeah (baow)
Work, hm, work, hm, work (hey, yeah, baow, baow, baow)
Just look at my ass when I twerk, hm, twerk, hm, twerk (baow, baow, baow)

A bitch like me, yeah, I know my worth
Fuckin' with me is a gift and a curse (ah)
