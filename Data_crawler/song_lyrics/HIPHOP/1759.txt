Song Name: I’m Back
There's a lot of murders in my city, talkin' eye for eye, die for die
Girls tryna lie, they're running round out here from guy to guy, I tried
But it's clear that me and you, we can't see eye to eye
When all that you can really see, is stuff that you feel I should buy
Yo, why should I?
One shooter with me they say, "Less is more"
But he will crash off, rest assured, I think it's best he gets insured
Them boys are insecure, say my name in songs to gеt in the door
Why you think they're mad? Wе're the ones that win the war
Step your game or you can't step to Fred
I spend but I invest the bread
So the new Rolex got more baguettes than Greggs
They say I'm clean and how I dress the best
But every time we pull up on them scenes, always left a mess
SMS and I don't take no disrespect except for when it's the 'net
My neck looks like crystal meth, the best is what I wish the rest
Yeah, they do it for the clout, your friends are all washed
The day I care about clout's when you can spend it in shops
It's gettin' sick on these blocks, most of my niggas, they shot
The rest of my niggas rob niggas that shop for shit that they got
I couldn't find 'em so I hit a spot, then hit up his boss
When I can't find guap, I find a watch and I'm rippin' it off
Now I've got all kind of watches 'cause I move the foulest
Just put my Richard in a new spot, call it movin' houses
I flew my youngins to Dubai, then they caged up the army
'Cause they took a couple APs at places we party
Phone the phone, don't ask me 'cause I don't work the order
Before rap, you didn't trap, it's cap, you weren't a baller
They think they drippin', but their jewellers really turned a corner
Niggas come around me and they realise, they've got dirty water
Got my mum a spot but I won't post in the house
What's all this postin' about?
Most rappers buy their people shit so they can post it for clout
We had all scared to go home like there's ghosts in his house
Set up shop here, we're closin' it down
Never heard a song where they're tellin' the truth
All that lyin' them boys do, should put some beds in the booth
These days the neekiest drillers, can be online speakin' on killers
And ain't no creepin' on dingers, and how you speakin' on dinners?
A lot of niggas speak but when I speak, the streets know it's realer
Chocolate girl in my passenger seat, but the seats are vanilla
Twenty-five thousand a week, that's just a sleep in a villa
If it ain't 'bout Ps, you can't even see or speak to a nigga like me
Businessman, invested in kick game and watched it expand
I set up shops, I set up spots, I'm not just in the gang
Real nigga, so any time when one of my real niggas land
I'm tryna help him out with this bag, like he's my nigga's gran'
I been the shit since I was a kid, now I'm still the man
The plan was to make millions, I made millions, and it's still the plan
Skinny nigga push a lot of weight, no, I don't need a hand
Fuck a gym, them new hammers in, got us feeling wham
Niggas speakin' my name 'cause they're seekin' the fame
But they ain't done shit, we ain't feelin' the same
But I bet we leave one sleepin' again, you spend a key on your chain
I spent like three, so we ain't the same
PJ, there won't be a delay
I buss the white gold Prezzi and got the same one in plain, prick
Got a plain rose Prezzi and got the same one with rain in
No new niggas with me, with the same ones I came with
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah
I think it's change, I fear
I said I wouldn't change, but change is here
Businessman, now I change career
I level up, then I go change the gear
So fuck a rainy day, I've got money saved for rainy years
But still don't get me upset
'Cause I change ya face with my crazy mates that can't wait to change the plates
Yeah, I came from estates to a place with gates
Where I was needing the change, but there's no change to make
And if it don't go one-sixty, that's not my car
Before songs, trappers knew my number off by heart
And rest in peace to Virgil, I still Off-White hard
When you grind how I grind, it's a matter of time, it's not by chance
They got a team but no, it's not like ours
Got the game on lock with my bars like all I drop's bicarb'
You ever sat down in prison, gettin' letters from a hoe that you don't even know?
Tellin' her to spray a little perfume on the envelope so you can get a smell of rose
The little bros love to shoot, so I don't ever tell 'em, "Go"
But they need it and I got it, then I won't ever tell 'em, "No"
I know who killed shh, but I won't never tell a soul, yeah
Made a million off my telephone
And made a couple more million pound out here sellin' shows, yo
And even though the opp block is so very close
For them boys to see me, they need to get them a telescope
All them chances I took just for the bread
For them to turn around and give me racks, just for my breath
I got paid, then the pain started to trouble me less
It's either that or when my brother put your brother to rest
Hustling pebs, tryna make it out till nothin' is left
And go again and again till we run into feds
I don't wear bras, but my chest, it's a double VS
I'm tired of jewellery though, it's time to fuckin' invest
I'm talkin' mortgages, it's got me shoppin' for rugs and ornaments
This ain't no rap, you know it's facts when I'm talkin' this
You're talkin' straps, I had more semis than them tournaments
Young nigga tryna reach to the final, check him
Oh, you're the type of prick to beg a bitch to stay?
I'm the type to spend twenty gibs, on any given day
Chasin' money out in many different ways
Till I'm dead and in the grave
That's the only time that Freddy will behave
Even your daughter's mum knows you're out here talkin' a lie
All them jewels that I buy, know it's more for the hype
And know I bought my daughters' house before I bought any 'bine
And caught a lot of yutes lackin' before I caught any flight, check it
My dad did in Feltham, taught me to fight
No phones in there, gotta talk through the pipe
Now I talk through the mic
Where you lose your shoes if you're awkward and shy
Where I'm from, the pussies lose, only the scorer survive
Remember times I felt poor in my life, now I'm ten times more than alright
Thank the Lord in the light
Now I'm on Lord of the mic
My young boys ride around with their swords on a bike ting
Swap that bike for a horse and they'll look more like a Viking
I've got loud little white tings
That fly so much, their skin's browner than my thing
They might be hard, but that shit ain't soundin' like my ting
Blowin' clouds, but you know that there's no cloud up in my bling
And never try lookin' at my worth on the 'net
'Cause Google don't know who I serve or how much work that I get
Yeah, I knew my life, see a change when I didn't wanna jerk the connect
And I much rather prefer the respect
Still I never use a cashpoint, you should know it isn't that
They get a room prepared for me when I go into the bank, yo
And even though I'm out here, still tryna work the block
I'm gettin' eighty for a verse, my breath's worth a lot
When I want a girl from the States, I just fly them in
He's hidin', flyin' 'cause he knows we're tryna find on him
I'm tryna find where you record and leave you lyin' in that studio you're lyin' in
Their burners ain't firin'
When my diamonds shinin', they can't help but be admirin'
When I got a show, know I can't help but bring the fire in
All that talk's the same reason we had a funeral
They can't diss me in the streets, gee, it's only in the musical
