Song Name: 2 Step - From the new “House Party” Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Toni
What you know about headrest private jets?
Stick in the Goyard, diamonds on the necklace (uh)
Did I hit or what? Took a shot, but you ducked
A-Town, fitted up, down to ball, bigger nuts
Stick with the clutch, V12, lift it up
Sponsored by the bigger buck, kiss my dick for luck
I'm the man the fans can't boo
Got a Can-Am in the streets, we ain't got no sand dune
You on fentanyl? Why you in here dozin' off?
Pistol in my drawers, I ain't finna fight with y'all
I'm the reason they sold the elbows
I'm the plug, that's why I call my restaurant Esco
Flex like I'm supposed, Hermes orange in the Rolls
Wrist in the bowl, other wrist, it was froze
Dropped a four and brought back some extra O's (extra)
Wallpaper, got it filled up with vegetables
Southside every day, come on, don't hesitate
Don't even procrastinate, we got some history to make
Even sold all the shake, I was bored like an ape
On the yacht, in the club, throw some ones in your face, yeah
Just the same old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Do Toni got the ladies? (Yeah, yeah)
Do Toni drive Mercedes? (Yeah, yeah)
Rep the A like Lil Baby (yeah, yeah)
Shoot your ass like DaBaby (yeah, yeah)
Stay out my business, don't take it personal
You know you work for me and I don't work for you
You know I'm blessed with the gift of finessin'
Lil' food for thought, but you need to digest it
Got a full safe, need a room for the moves I made (made)
I've been on my game since Ali Bomaye (woo)
Wrote my name in cursive on her punani
I'm never rehearsin', real one all day
Just the same old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Just the old two-step (same old two-step)
Same old two-step (same old two-step)
Yeah, yeah
Slide, slide
Yeah, yeah
Slide, slide
Stick, slide
Stick, slide
Slide, stick
