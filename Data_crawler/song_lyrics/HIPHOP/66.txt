Song Name: GOTTI
Got me, got me Rollie
(Ya can't even afford it though)
Got me, got me, ultra
Gotti Gotti, uh
Gotti Gotti
Okay, my blood gang, 30 bang
Scum Gang
Big choppa, big thang
Let your nuts hang
Who that? Don't say
BBA change your mood, aye
Anyday
Gotti got it
Cookin' up, speed it up
Double cup, Xanny cup
Booted up, mollied up
Molly up, break it up
Cop it, then I serve it up
Give it up
Gotti got it
Fuck with my day ones
Yeah you know I flooded the chain once
Got the money and I split it with day ones
She ain't fuck me back when I was lame, nah
You ain't know I do my dance? (Do it)
In the club (Aye), throwin' dub
Rack it up (Rack it), shake it up
Watch me do a hop, bust it up (Up)
I mix it up, then I hit her with the blicky, uh
So drippy, drippy, drippy, drippy
You ain't got no money, you can keep her
Bitch, I got my Nina, I'ma squeeze her
If you really wanna meet her, she a greeter
It was really nice to meet ya, I don't need ya (I don't need her)
I pray to God that my niggas gon' eat
I pray to God that my family gon' see
Prayin' that the Lord take a chance with me
Wouldn't come when I was up
I was on the wrong things
I ain't silly
Ain't no dumb nigga, are you dumb, nigga?
Are you stayin' with the pump, nigga?
Fuck is up, nigga?
Is you mad? You's a fuck nigga
I don't trust niggas
Scum Gang, chew 'em up, nigga
We don't fuck witcha
Okay, my blood gang, 30 bang
Scum Gang
Big choppa, big thang
Let your nuts hang
Who that? Don't say
BBA change your mood, aye
Anyday
Gotti got it
Cookin' up, speed it up
Double cup, Xanny cup
Booted up, mollied up

Who, who really with the money, money?
Who, who really with the Gotti, Gotti?
Who, who really with the money, money?

Mollied up, molly up, give it up
