Song Name: Wow. - Remix
Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixin' up the vodka, with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagon, G-Wagon
G-Wagon, G-Wagon
All the housewives pullin' up (Up, up)
I got a lot of toys, 720S, bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' (I be grinnin'), yeah
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hundred deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Bustin' on my jeans, I got big racks (Hey)
We gon' pull up in the Cullinan in the double G (Wow)
I keep a ticket on me, nigga, ain't nothin' to me
I'm draped down in Givenchy
I just put blue guts in the 'Rari
Rich niggas only in this section, I'm sorry
Bust down watch and shades by Bvlgari
I'm smokin' on jet fuel like Bob Marley
I spend a hundred thousand on my necklace, check
Real street nigga from the set, mmh, check
I was in the projects, now I'm on the jet
I ain't even tryna talk if it ain't about a check, yeah
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hundred deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Brand new everything, yeah
Tell your friend to stop it, come here (Wow)
Hah, no drinks in the Rolls Royce, just got it (Yeah)
She wanna bounce on my dick
Tell her friend 'bout it (Hah)
And the party ain't a party 'til I'm inside it (Nope)
If they lick it up, then they invited (Wow)
Mighty Duck ice challenge
And I'm looking for a freak with no mileage
I'm back on my shit, fuck how you feel about it (Fuck)
Big diamonds on my neck, can't even hide it (No)
Shake that ass though, shake that ass though
In the bathroom, in a bathrobe
In the front seat of the Lambo'
Bad bitches on the West Coast
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"(Wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah)
Hundred deep when I roll like the army (Yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
