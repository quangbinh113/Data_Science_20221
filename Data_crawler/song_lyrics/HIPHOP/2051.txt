Song Name: Stick (with JID & J. Cole feat. Kenny Mason & Sheck Wes)
I got the time, ayy
It's up and it's stuck, and it's stuck where it's up, fah
Hahaha (fuck 'bout you, pray for them folks, bro, pray for them folks)
Oh, I know you niggas ain't see this comin' (on me, bro, fuck 'bout this shit, bro)
I mean, normally around this time, I'd ask if you was ready (turn me the fuck up, bruh)
But I know there's no way you niggas was ready for what's about to happen (AraabMUZIK)
Stick, stick, stick (bitch), stick (boom, Gangsta)
Stick, stick (bitch), stick (bitch), stick
I got a new stick (bitch), I got a new stick (bitch, boom)
I got a new stick (boom), I got a new stick (boom)
Stick (bitch), stick (bitch), stick (bitch), stick (yeah)
Stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick, bitch)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick, bitch)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick, bitch)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
If I see that nigga, I'ma wet his ho ass up
Roll down the window (brrt), roll up the window (ooh)
Roll down the window (brrt), roll up the window (ooh)
Roll down the window (brrt), roll up the window (ooh)
Roll down the window (yeah, brrt) roll up the window (uh, okay)
Hand on my dick and my hand on my gun
One is for shootin' and one is for fun
Niggas trippin' off of 151
Black & Milds burnin' under the sun
Black and brown kids young or they dumb?
Sack a town, where your mom and them from?
Gather 'round, run in all of your shit
But what did you get? (New stick)
I say it's up (I got a new stick), that mean it's stuck
Run out of bullets (I got a new stick), you run out of luck
One in the cribbo (I got a new stick) and one in the truck
One in the tippo 'cause bloody ain't duck
Step a foot up on the yard and get struck
Everyone I grew around was a thug
Thought he was a shooter, thought he was tough
Found his body coolin' out in the cut
Shit, Fulton County, 50 cal' in the tuck
Fuck around and shoot the cavalry up
Bullets sneezing, we got allergies, we got alibis
We got calibers, categorized
FN, bitch, capitalized, better recognize
I got sick and tired of lettin' bitches slide (I got a new stick)
So I'm in the whip, I got the stick inside (I got a new stick)
If I sniff a scent, smell a lie (I got a new stick)
Smell a bitch, crack a smile, let it rip, let it ride
First time, second line, second time, bloodline
Third time, even - dyin', takin' one of mine
I'm on Candler Road with a chopper from Columbine
Creepin' on the cracker tryna colonize
(Leave God out of this, JID)
Stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick (bitch)
Stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick (yeah), stick
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick, ooh)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
Yeah, bitch, pull up proper (bitch)
Dance on the pussy, I salsa (cha-cha)
I am not from Earth (hell nah)
Sheck Wes pulled up in a saucer (ooh, bitch)
I heard you fell in love with that bitch (bitch)
Sheck Wes fell in love with the chopper (ow)
Sheck Wes, I'm a motherfuckin' monster (yeah)
I came out the water like a Loch Ness (yeah)
My niggas on the block with no options (No)
They smokin' niggas like Hot Grabba (Grabba, Grabba)
I bought a new stick (bitch), came with a new bitch (bitch)
Bought the ho new kicks (walkin')
Off the music, bitch, I got rich, left you niggas clueless (ching-ching)
Got a couple cribs, got a couple whips, I don't wanna do shit (no)
Nah, I don't wanna do shit
Now, hold up, hold up, hold up, Sheck, don't get stagnant
Hood girls and models all in these pageants
You don't know my neck, bitch, I been havin'
I ain't internet, these niggas been laggin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I still keep a ratchet
Spit fire like an RAF pilot
Steal a nigga bitch, I feel like Aladdin
Me and my white friends gon' get blasted off the (stick)
Alright, so check it out
You niggas over here talkin' 'bout festivals
I'm thinkin' more like invasions
You gon' stop playin' on Dreamville's time (Gangsta Grizzillz)
Like niggas don't run this
Uh (oh, shit)
Pray for me, God's got a play for me
Me and them are not standing adjacently (no way)
Thirsty for the clout, talkin' too brazenly
Bullet hit his mouth, at least he died tastefully (oh, shit)
Good Lord has never forsaken me
In God I trust, so I get money faithfully (hahaha)
Not just occasionally
Got to make cake every day like I work for a bakery (yeah)
I know you pussy, the secret's not safe with me
You crazy, you think you gon' take from me (yeah)
Not for extortin', treat problems like Orkin
I call up some niggas I know that's gon' spray for me (woo, woo, woo, brrt)
Speakin' in code 'case they tapin' me
Let off the whole fuckin' clip, leave a vacancy (bah, bah, bah, bah)
I'm 'bout that two with the six, so I'm basically
Reppin' more shooters than Rich Paul's agency
They get to clutchin', you best get to duckin'
Like 6'7" niggas that's dunkin' for Oregon
Money so long, if I start in the south
And then spread this shit out, it'd be touchin' like Portland
So it's no wonder I'm walkin' with caution
I know that God got his grace with me
But I'll still treat a ride through the hood like a
Hike through the woods, got a stick that I take with me
Stick, stick, stick, stick (DJ Drama)
Stick, stick, stick, stick (welcome to D-Day, suckers)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
I got a new stick (I got a brand-new stick)
Dreamville
Stick up the shell, pick up the shell (Gangsta Grizzillz, new)
Lit up the air, niggas in here (stick)
Stick up the shell, pick up the shell (new)
Lit up the air, niggas in here (stick)
Stick up the shell, pick up the shell (new)
Lit up the sh-, niggas in here (stick)
Stick up the shell, pick up the shell (new)
Lit up the air, niggas in here (stick)
