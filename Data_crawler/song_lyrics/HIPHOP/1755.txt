Song Name: Trick
Real bitches get down on the floor (on the floor)
Broke niggas ain't payin', let 'em go (nigga, please)
Give me that cash, look at that ass, give 'em a show (mmh)
Get what I want, ain't no nigga telling me no (fuck)
He a trick (ah)
Open that wallet, breakin' them pockets
He a trick (guy)
I need islands, fly me private
He a trick (He a trick)
I can buy it, but he got it
He a trick, trick, trick, trick, trick
He a trick
Know he only fuckin' if the check right
Shinin' on these bitches like a headlight
Bitch, I'm that, know he got the bread right (prrr)
Fuck a nigga, make a nigga red light
I don't wanna vibe, I just want the pesos
Nah, we don't kick it with these fake hoes (bitch)
Spend it, I'ma buss it like a draco
I don't wanna talk if you ain't talkin' 'bout a bankroll
I love a trick who gon' do what he say
See what he got and I'm takin' advantage
Drop me a bag in the back of the Wraith
Eat up the pussy, I'm speaking in Spanish
Yeah, I be gettin' in, having my way
Know when I call it, I'm calling for hunnids
Yeah, I be spending up all of his money
'Cause who give a fuck if he mad? I ain't stuntin' him
I got, huh, all of this cash on me, huh
All of this ass on me, huh
Make him put the flash on me, huh
You can check the status on me, I'm fine
Yeah, he wanna wife this shit (wife)
Yeah, I know you like this shit (okay)
Mad hoes never, wanna fight this bitch
He gon' blow it on the bank with the white, no tent
Real bitches get down on the floor (on the floor)
Broke niggas ain't payin', let 'em go (nigga, please)
Give me that cash, look at that ass, give 'em a show (mmh)
Get what I want, ain't no nigga telling me no (fuck)
He a trick (ah)
Open that wallet, breakin' them pockets
He a trick (guy)
I need islands, fly me private
He a trick (he a trick)
I can buy it, but he got it
He a trick, trick, trick, trick, trick
He a trick
Spend it in the strip club, spend it on the pussy (ah)
Spend it how you want it, you can spend it on a booking
Where your partner with the rubber bands? Where the other man
That be spending all them hunnid bands? Need a hunnid grand (yeah)
Fights cold and that body stupid
Why you think he wanna blow it on me?
Why you think he wanna give it up
And he don't give a fuck 'cause I'ma show it to him (bitch)
I'm do it to him crazy, make him have a baby
Shit, I really owe it to him
Rappin' to him like I'm flowin' to him
Give me money while I'm moanin' to him
I got, huh, all of this cash on me, huh
All of this ass on me, huh
Make him put the flash on me, huh
You can check the status on me, I'm fine
Yeah, he wanna wife this shit (wife)
Yeah, I know you like this shit (okay)
Mad hoes never wanna fight this bitch
He gon' blow it on the bank with the white, no tent
Real bitches get down on the floor (on the floor)
Broke niggas ain't payin', let 'em go (nigga, please)
Give me that cash, look at that ass, give 'em a show (mmh)
Get what I want, ain't no nigga telling me no (fuck)
He a trick (ah)
Open that wallet, breakin' them pockets
He a trick (guy)

He a trick (he a trick)
I can buy it, but he got it
He a trick, trick, trick, trick, trick
He a trick
