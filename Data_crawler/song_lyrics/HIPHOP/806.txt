Song Name: Change
I'm tryna make a lil' change, mummy thinks that I'm insane
Tryna make it out of the rain, these niggas know that I'mma get it
Now let me tell you one fact, we ain't defending, we all out attack
Disrespect Alz and I'm coming right back
I can tell you 'bout him, man you know he just lack
Tryna double tap waps
Separate fake from real, that's rap
My nigga tryna make it out the city, that's a fact
All my brothers trapping hard up in a bando
Screaming free my nigga, we've been talking through a zanco
R.I.P M, all he wanted was them bankrolls
Hard to get it right when you ain't getting it legit
Hitting cells like Vegeta going coo as a kid
Niggas asking me for favours, I don't owe them shit
I remembered them days I ain't had a pot to piss
Don't talk about risks, cah my nigga I'm taking 'em
All these one on ones like Cech, I ain't saving 'em
If you saw my eyes then you'll probably see the pain in 'em
I see you hating but, what's all the hate for?
Is it 'cause we about to blow like some claymores
I'm tryna make a lil' change, mummy thinks that I'm insane
Tryna make it out of the rain, these niggas know that I'mma get it
Now let me tell you one fact, we ain't defending, we all out attack
Disrespect Alz and I'm coming right back
I can tell you 'bout him, man you know he just lack
Tryna double tap waps
Separate fake from real, that's rap
My nigga tryna make it out the city, that's a fact
Claim to be the hardest, my nigga you retarded
Increase my blessings, a.k.a that shit is rewarded
So much shells in this bitch, this shit is bombarded
R.I.P Malcom he wasn't guarded
The only real nigga that can murder me
Is me and myself, it's a burglary
It's family first, so you heard it b
So I'll be barking, it's a family tree
All these drugs in my body got me going crazy
Trapping late nights I don't know about the fucking lady
I know haters from the west, I know hitters from the north
She sucking my dick while standing, she know she a dwarf
But lemme just change the flow, one day YMN we gon' blow
Take my word, my nigga I show
Trapping late nights, yeah we gon' blow
I'm tryna make a lil' change, mummy thinks that I'm insane
Tryna make it out of the rain, these niggas know that I'mma get it
Now let me tell you one fact, we ain't defending, we all out attack
Disrespect Alz and I'm coming right back
I can tell you 'bout him, man you know he just lack
Tryna double tap waps
Separate fake from real, that's rap
My nigga tryna make it out the city, that's a fact
