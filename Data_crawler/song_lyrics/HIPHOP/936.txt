Song Name: Toxic
Uh, uh, uh (Harry, Harry Potter)
Baby, I'm a soldier, you won't find nobody solider
Love that bitch so much, I caught her cheatin', would've shot at her
Fuck broken hearts, keep stuffin' all these hundreds 'til my pockets hurt
I just go by morals, I don't care 'bout who more popular
Heard his hoe went missin', she with gang like we adopted her
Got a low-key freak, I save her pics, but I don't follow her
Lil Cap, he got heat, the type of heat that break thermometers
Way far from my peak and where I started, took a lot of work
When I turned 18, I tried to see how much my block was worth
Right on Evergreen with Glocks, on edge, bitch, we on opp alert
Same niggas hatin' out there watchin' with binoculars
Legends never die, you the reason I stopped poppin' Percs
All she say is, "Boy, you so selfish"
I told her, "Baby, I'm a gangster, I can't help it"
Uh, and I'm with them members really melt shit
In the ground, every nigga that we dealt with (uh)
Pipe it up, feel the beat and let that bass knock
He get left right in the streets when that K rock
Fireworks, got some shit that make your face drop
When lil' Hot 'nem, they get started, they just can't stop
A lil' white boy from the 'burbs got the nerve to tell me I ain't goin' hard enough
Like he really ever had it hard enough, like, bitch, don't get me started up
I'm still gon' be right here if the rap game clean the garbage up
Can't bar for nothin'
I'm with some renegades, Draco beatin', feel the bass
.223s hit his face, tactical, won't leave a trace
I was thuggin', grandma hopin' that this shit a phase
20 chains, six figures just to hit the stage
All she say is, "Boy, you so selfish"
I told her, "Baby, I'm a gangster, I can't help it"
Uh, and I'm with them members really melt shit
In the ground, every nigga that we dealt with (uh)
Pipe it up, feel the beat and let that bass knock
He get left right in the streets when that K rock
Fireworks, got some shit that make your face drop
When lil' Hot 'nem, they get started, they just can't stop
