Song Name: Antisocial (feat. Juice WRLD)
Don't forget it, I ain't had love in a minute
I was on the drugs for a minute, I'm sorry (yeah)
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
I ain't had love in a minute
I been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
(Going through-)
I ain't had love in a minute
I been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately, I been drowning in my feelings (Takeoff)
When I'm in my feelings
I pour me some codeine just so I can feel it (drank, lean)
No doctor, nurse, or pharmacy needed, the way I prescrip' it (sip it)
Pray I don't get cursed, rebukin' the demons with the Holy Spirit (God)
And I was makin' it work before I had fame, I had to go get it (did it)
I'm down to run up some M&Ms, my niggas, you wit' it? (M&M)
The cash, the rack, the bags, the few synonyms, my niggas, you get it? (Cheese)
You tryna fuck with The Rocket? What's in your pocket?
Better come with it (come with it)
Word around town there's a body 'hind me, first degree murder, had did it (brrt)
Don't know what you heard, but they lyin'
If I ain't the greatest, then who is you kiddin'? (Who?)
I go and put on a piece of my jewelry, my definition of chillin' (ice)
Ain't been in love in a minute, so, baby I'm sorry if I lose the feeling (sorry)
They want us to stop takin' drugs
But ain't nobody stopping the killin' (why?)
I ain't had love in a minute
I been on drugs for a minute (hey, hey)
I ain't hit my plug in a minute (whoo)
Lately, I been drownin' in my feelings (yeah, yeah)
I was drownin' in a pint of lean
I could see the demons in my sleep
I was lookin' for the loyalty
Takin' more drugs than Medell√≠n
I lost my dawg to fentanyl, and I wasn't dissin' Lil Peep
Pop Smoke, rest in peace, wish I could put him under my wing
For my dawgs, give me a call, I'ma follow through
I need the same in return when I call you
Just look at what this world done came to
If we don't stick together then we all lose
We can't explain it (no), the world rotatin' (woah)
We can't stay patient, please give us an explanation (yeah)
Before we go crazy, we need savin' (savin')
'Cause I think we all above rehabilitation (woah)
Get on your job (Job), you gotta get all your niggas involved
'Cause breakin' the code like breakin' the law (ayy)
Antisocial, don't say what you saw, no (nope)
They showin' you love, then please don't fall
I ain't had love in a minute (no love, no)
I been on drugs for a minute (on drugs, yeah)
I ain't hit my plug in a minute (hit my plug, no)
Lately, I been drownin' in my feelings (drown)
I ain't had love in a minute (no love, no)
I been on drugs for a minute (on drugs, yeah)
I ain't hit my plug in a minute (hit my plug, no)
Lately, I been drownin' in my feelings (drown)
I ain't had love in a minute (ain't had no love)
I been on drugs for a minute (I ain't had no love, no, no)
Lately, I been drownin' in my feelings
Now I lay me down to sleep
(Okay, now-now let me-let me go over)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Just walk me through the night, and walk me through the Heaven gate
Just walk me through the night, and walk me through the Heaven gate
