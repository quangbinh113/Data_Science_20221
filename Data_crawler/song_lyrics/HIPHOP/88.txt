Song Name: Underwater FlyZone
Yeah
Che-check one two, one two
Check one two (fuck), yeah
Mm, mm (Huh, huh, huh)
Yeah
Try'na keep my (keep my) composure
I don't have anyone's shoulder anymore (anymore), anymore
Anymore, anymore (anymore), yeah
Anymore (anymore), anymore (anymore), yeah
It's like I've been castaway, fast away
By my lone, by my own
I don't have anyone to cry with, or to die with
I die on my own
On my, on my own, on my own
It seems like the underwater is my flyzone, my flyzone
Try'na keep my composure
I don't have anyone's shoulder anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore (anymore), yeah
Anymore (anymore), anymore (anymore), yeah-eah
Too many times, too many times, I've
Too many times, too many times
I've tried to be your friend, till the very end
I'm try'na fight, through the light
Even though I've been blind
I'm trying, I'm trying, Ohh, ohh, ohh
Try'na keep my (keep my) composure
I don't have anyone's shoulder anymore (anymore), anymore
Anymore, anymore (anymore), yeah
Anymore (anymore), anymore (anymore), yeah
Yeah anymore
I won't fight anymore, I won't cry anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, yeah
Leave me in the dark end, leave me in the back end
Leave me back in your arms
Leave me in the dark end, leave me in the back end
Leave me back in your arms, your arms, your arms
Try'na keep my (keep my) composure
I don't have anyone's shoulder anymore (anymore), anymore
Anymore (anymore), anymore-ah (anymore), yeah
Anymore, anymore-ah (anymore), yeah
