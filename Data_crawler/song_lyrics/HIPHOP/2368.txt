Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl if you leave just let me know
So I won't look dumb when you move on
