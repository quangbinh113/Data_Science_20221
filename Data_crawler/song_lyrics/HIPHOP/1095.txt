Song Name: Star Song (feat. Lil Durk)
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You told me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You told me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go
I'm a real player, so I gotta stick to the code
I gotta stick to the code
Gotta be comfortable, I can't be slick with these hoes
And she got four, five bros
So I can't trust her
So I gotta stick with my pole
Walk out the trap with the crack in my clothes
Sleep in the trap, I'm not changing my clothes
She want the drugs, she want the Molly and Percocet
Now she be touching her toes
Hundred thousand dollar clean money, not no dirty money
Now I feel like a Jew
Louis Vuitton and CELINE money
Now she cool on it, now she want Jimmy Choo
Pardon my body, oh
He was a killer, he told me
He told me he didn't, but I know he did
You better not lie, I already know
Get that bag, I'm on a roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm with the robbers
Gotta keep a gun on me everyday
Knowing it ain't promised tomorrow
I'ma get the bag, bag that even though that it come with the problems
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You tell me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You told me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go
I'm a real player, so I gotta stick to the code
Baby, just bring me your body, I promise I won't tell nobody about it
And I keep a stick on my hip with a clip
And I promise I won't leave without it
I bought some brand-new baguettes, I'm dripping on niggas like VVS (VVS)
Louis shoes, and they came with a vest (with a vest)
Knew I was different from all the rest
I think you perfect how you are (are)
The light of my life, you one of a kind (kind)
I just want you every time (time)
Baby, won't you hit my line? (Line)
I just want you to be mine (mine)
You always get mad when I leave
But, baby, you know I got places to go
I just took a trip to Cali, and then I got paid for a show
Now I'm back on the road
My baby, you my little spider
You my little stepper but you not a fighter (fight, fight)
I love your desire and fire
I know that you are forever my rider (ride)
My baby, you my little spider
You my little stepper but you not a fighter (fight, fight)
I love your desire and fire
I know that you are forever my rider
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You told me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go (go)
I think you perfect how you are
You're a star (you're a star)
You're one in a million
I done met a lot of people, but nobody gave me this feeling
You told me to cut off my exes and hoes
I told you, cross all your X's and circle your O's
You already know how it go (go)
I'm a real player, so I gotta stick to the code
