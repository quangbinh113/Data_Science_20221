Song Name: Because (feat. Joey Bada$$, Russ, and Dylan Cartlidge)
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because you better not, you better not stay
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because but this song is so non-desirable
I'm from where too many lives, 25 years or fewer
Nothin' we receive is brand new, it's just newer
While brothers drop down to their knees and make do of
Popsicle sticks raced down the curb into the sewer (you don't have to)
The next American hangman, sketch the crayon
Gangland all a fa√ßade, the truth persuade on
Killin' birds with one stone is what we stay on
Wingspan never too wide for you to fray on (you don't have to)
The ways never seems to amaze or inspire
Illiterate, the signatures been forged, the fire
Broken spirit, some are simply required
It confirmed the door of no return at El Mara (you don't have to)
Screamin' into the ocean for emotional support
We never won awards, we was boards to the court
Puttin' swords to umbilical cords to cut 'em short
Translation, vacation is at a last resort (you don't have to)
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because but this song is so non-desirable
We took shoestrings, lemon drops, and chips from the deli
Knocked 'em out the box with spinner tops and skelly
"Do it, you'll get to it," what Mr. Woo Mac would tell me
I was locked, my celly read nigga, no Makaveli (you don't have to)
This inheritance was negative, marriage is the devil's piss
State's evidence, give us anything instead of this drama
In the mirror like, Yayoi Kusama
Had me turn into Muhammad, to Buddha the Dalai Lama (you don't have to)
If I would snatch a shoulder bag from somebody mama
Am I cancerous? Can't discuss what the short answer was
Hungry as wars, take the money and run
Sometimes, simultaneously take the one of your lungs (you don't have to)
What I mean is I've seen everything that's under the sun
Niggas below the poverty line live under the gun
We all schemin', savages ain't vegan, what the fuck is love?
Don't need a reason to die, we die just because (you don't have to)
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because you better not stay, you better not stay
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because but this song is so non-desirable
I was on 34 cruisin' through Medina
I was just a Neo 'fore I had the Nina
I had the snapback with the tees on
Practicin' my ollie, I could hardly get my feet up (you don't have to)
Had me hittin' the staircase just to roll the reefer, uh
Now, I'm smokin' big Cohibas out in Costa Rica like Korda Frida
Havin' flashbacks, niggas gettin' clapped at in front of the cleaners
On 34th street, until this day it haunts me (you don't have to)
It's why I had to move raunchy
I know killers in Marcy, so please don't taunt me
I spent some summer times in Canarsie
Me and Quan gettin' stopped and frisked by Hutch & Starsky (you don't have to)
They was lookin' for hard drugs in our movie
Mama told me not to let that shit bother me
Papa said to move cautiously
So, the streets would never father me
But you don't know that part of me (you don't have to)
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because but this song is so non-desirable
Yeah
My girl told me I should watch my tongue, my skin gets red too easy
She don't wanna change her name like Washington
Wonders where I got it from, my parents' marriage was a toxic one
Mmm, oh well, I'm 'bout to cop a gun (you don't have to)
Hope I get to use it, it'll help blow up the music
I know somethin' slightly off with me, drama is therapeutic
Ego hates feeling futile, sometimes, I move without scruples
Like havin' Mrs. Perfect with me and still chasin' approval (you don't have to)
From other women, I'm a glutton, I can't run from who I become
Dad's around the corner, haven't seen him in like three months
We don't speak much, I don't handle balance well, got a fragile shell
My money split the king and queen up, then the castle fell (you don't have to)
The tension in the air is still crisp
Sometimes I wish this game was over like I'm Lil Flip
'Cause sometimes, I'm wishing that my brain came with a kill switch
I don't vacation, dawg, I guilt-trip, real shit, yeah (you don't have to)
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because you better not stay, you better not stay
Because it's hard to find your love, I found it out
Because but this song is so non-desirable
