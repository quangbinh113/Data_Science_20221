Song Name: COFFEE BEAN
Bad, bad news
I'm just bad, bad news

Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between, yeah (This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)
How would you feel if I had you? (This is all)
Trust me, you would be mad too (This is all)
Shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move (This is all)
Plus I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense (This is all)
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind
Behind this glass tint, yeah (This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, yeah, back in the bathroom line (This is)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you (This is all)
Don't worry I'll be back for you
All the money and cars
Stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean
Reflecting on all you see (This is all, this is all)
Stressing the over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (This is all)
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope (Ooh)
Some shit only me and Lord knows (Ooh)
SOS, for those who hear this in morse code (Ooh)
Too many doors closed cul-de-sacs and fork roads
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes (This is all)
This shit'll have you in divorce court
Fighting over your seeds
Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)
Alimony and fees (Ooh)
As your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)
