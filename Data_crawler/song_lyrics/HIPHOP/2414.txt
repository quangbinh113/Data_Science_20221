Song Name: Indo Black Magic
Indo girls go loco
Kulit fair or maybe coco
Got black magic straight from Indo
You puke glass thats my mistake yo
Eating nasi we so sweet savory
Pelet got nothin on me
Ooh women we got some wicked beauty
Indo got some
Racunnya laki laki
Datang dari rusuk sendiri
Kalau kamu ingin tahu
Lihat aku oh oh oh
One time menarik
Two time fantastic
Three times you're intoxicated
Dayaknese smile make u go bloody ody
Melanesian 8 figure body ody
Minang attitude oh yeah yes mami
Stop and stare a diamond from Bali
There's no need another guna guna on these
Sunda eyes will hypnotize you my boy
Guys who said they dont date locals smell tuna tuna fishy ah
Indo girls go loco
Kulit fair or maybe coco
Got black magic straight from Indo
You puke glass thats my mistake yo
Eating nasi we so sweet savory
Pelet got nothin on me
Ooh women we got some wicked beauty
Indo got some
Memang aku suka cheese and pasta
Yo quiero taquito y con la salsa
But nothing could compare to Indo punya rasa
Baby u on god tier jelas beda kasta
Alamak kuning langsat ya lebi lemak
Alamat need ur address ima pick you up
Alamak gadis indo ku lebih kenak
Mohon izin hamba
Memasuki hutan rimbamu
Lekuk perbukitan sumba
Kaulah satu yang ku damba
Tak bisa berpaling lagi (I can't)
Kemanapun aku pergi (I can't)
Simpin' on my Indo
Sampai aku mati
Layak prasmanan tabula rasa
U be the buffet inside mi casa
Kaka ko darah mana?
Darahmu, what'd you wanna?
Taste heaven date a batak like me
Exploding rasa ooh mami
Those who say they dont date locals smell tuna tuna fishy ah
Indo girls go loco
Kulit fair or maybe coco
Got black magic straight from Indo
You puke glass thats my mistake yo
Eating nasi we so sweet savory
Pelet got nothin on me
Ooh women we got some wicked beauty
Indo got some
Black magic straight from Indo
Black magic straight from Indo
Black magic straight from Indo
You got magic just like Indo
Black magic straight from Indo
Black magic straight from Indo
We got some yeah yeah oh
