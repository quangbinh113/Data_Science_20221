Song Name: Pusha Man
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows
And chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib, igh, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'ma tell the buyer what Nitty told me
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that Goddamn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that Goddamn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
You a lame
And your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all of these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to Papa", she said, "Papa, yes"
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that Goddamn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that Goddamn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
