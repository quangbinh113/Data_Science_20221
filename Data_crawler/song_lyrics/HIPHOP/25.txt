Oww!
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, oh-oh baby
Just tryna change your life
I'm just tryna change your life
Just tryna change your life
Oh-oh, baby
Bitch, you outta line, why you waste my time?
I'm tryna smoke, tryna get high, see it in my eyes
I know she playin' both sides, that bitch tellin' lies
But my dick give her a high, she down for the ride
Them hatin' bitches kill the vibe, fuck it, live your life
Bad bitches in Hawaii, umbrella with ice
10 bad bitches on my side, make 'em all my wife
Smokin' on the finest ganja, she like China white
Poppin' all these pills she said she used to it
She wanna go way up, okay baby, if you used to it
And I know that you a grown woman
And I know that you know what you're doing
Wet, wet, wet, wet (Yeah)
Wet, wet, wet, wet (I-I-I, I am)
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, oh-oh baby
I'm a king, baby
You from the hood but you a queen, baby
Ass fat, it can't even fit in them jeans, baby
Matchin' Wraith with the stars, baby
I'm a street nigga, I'm supposed to really be behind bars, baby
Really wanna be faithful but this shit hard, baby
Yup, I got the pussy first and then I ignored you (Ignored you)
You fucked another nigga, you ain't loyal (Loyal)
I told you bring a friend, this shit gettin' borin' (Borin')
She asked me what we are, we just cordial
I'm a gangsta I can make a wet, wet turn into a pool (Splash)
She help me count the money in the trap
Then she go back to school (School, school, school)
If a nigga ever play with bae, shit it's breaking news (Pow)
She got 50 pointers on her neck, Pateks that's matchin' jewels
Wet, wet, wet, wet (Yeah)
Wet, wet, wet, wet (Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah)
Wet, wet, wet, wet (Wet, yeah, wet)
Wet, wet, oh-oh baby (Wet, wet, wet)
I just wanna show you off, I don't wanna do you wrong
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of 'em all?
I get money when I want, I can fuck her if I want
Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (Ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (Ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (Ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come here lemme break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost
I was gonna put you on, I was gonna put you on
I was gonna change your life, girl but I don't wanna break your heart
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, oh-oh baby
Just tryna change your life
I'm just tryna change your life
Just tryna change your life
Oh-oh, baby
I can change your whole sauce, you a lil' mo' spicy (Yeah)
Now you dealin' with a boss, I might treat you rightly (Nah)
No more Macy jewelry, baby, now you drippin' icy (Ayy)
You keep hangin' 'round me, baby, you'll start talkin' like me
Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego
I be swimmin' in the money, baby, whish torpedo
I ain't like these rapper niggas, they is not my stylo
I'ma call you back, I'm with my niggas shootin' cee-lo
I might change my old ways for you, baby
I can change your whole wave, now you wavey
Now you glamorous, I'm out your element
I'm too reckless for you, girl, it's evident
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, oh-oh baby
Just tryna live your life
I'm just tryna change your life
Just tryna change your life
Oh-oh, baby
