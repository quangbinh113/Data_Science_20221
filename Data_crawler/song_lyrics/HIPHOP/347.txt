If it's 'bout money, then we on it (woah)
Water on my neck, you could ski on it (ooh)
You can't unthaw these diamonds, put the heat on it (what)
I was layin' in my bed while she dreamed on it (yeah)
Man, I touched that thing back, put my knee on it (yeah)
Man, my shoes was too fresh with my feet on it (woah)
Went to the jeweler, top of the morning
24 hours, then I was sorted (let's go)
You was not locked up, you was in holdin'
I know some niggas got life and they posin'
All in they picture, she know I'm richer
Yeah that her nigga, look at my wrist-er
Heard you flew sticker, I do not miss her
She not enough, I need a friend
I feel like Trisha, totaled my car
I cannot fix her, she pose for the pic (skrr)
Make the bitch lick it, I got a lamb
I got a fist, she ride on my dick like it's a RipStik
Smack on her bottom like that shit a mysty
I'm 30 M's in, still in the trenches
Went to the dentist 'cause I'm a menace
Fucked the old cougar just for her picture
Pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, photo shoot, pose (woah)
Pose, pose, pose, pose, photoshoot, pose, pose, hold up, pose
