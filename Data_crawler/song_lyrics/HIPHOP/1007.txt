Song Name: DON'T LEAVE ME (feat. G Herbo & Lil Durk)
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah
Run that back, Turbo (that's crazy)
Lord, please, you hear me pleadin' (uh)
My soul bleedin' (bleedin'), heart screamin' (heart screamin')
Fightin' demons (fightin'), right now, I need you (I need you), uh
Tell bae, "Don't leave me" (don't leave me), bae, don't leave me, uh
Bae, don't leave me, bae, don't leave me (uh, please)
Bae, don't leave me, bae, don't leave me, uh
Bae, don't lеave me (bae), baе, don't leave me (yeah, please)
Bae, don't leave me (bae), bae, don't leave me, uh
I'm smokin' dope, I get so high, I meet my demons (I do)
Just turned seventeen, the shit I've seen, they wouldn't believe it (they wouldn't)
Just two years ago, my mama was off the drugs, tweakin'
Now I'm in L.A. eating sushi next to The Weeknd (huh)
Put that on my soul, they don't know what I've been through
These hoes used to curve, now I'm the one that they into (no, no)
I'm with big bro Swerv', bumping Juice WRLD, that no issue
Back then, we wasn't cool, now you hit me like "I miss you"
Okay, it's 'cause I got it now, flooded out the face, I'm on my way
M.O.B., fuck all these bitches, I'm focused on gettin' paid
Made fifty today, spent fifty today, I'm in my bag
Bought my mom a crib, fuck designer, I do not know Raf
Lord, please, you hear me pleadin' (uh)
My soul bleedin' (bleedin'), heart screamin' (heart screamin')
Fightin' demons (fightin'), right now, I need you, uh (I need you)
Tell bae, "Don't leave me" (don't leave me), bae, don't leave me
Like give me a reason
She told me she seen me drinkin' out this cup (woah, woah), then she gon' leave me
Get too high when I say I'ma stop doin' all these drugs (oh), I ain't even mean it
She told me, "I don't pay attention," I told her, "I'm sorry (oh, woah, woah), lil' baby, I need you"
I turned you up and I took you out that Camry, I put you (oh, woah, woah) in the Lamborghini
Make-up sex every time she get mad, she wake up, she'll grab my penis (penis)
I did some time in jail, I wrote her a letter, I told her, "Bae, don't leave me" (leave me)
If you hear me talk to my dawg 'bout these streets (oh), never repeat it
I'm this mannish with it, I tell her, "Grab my head" every time I eat it
It's five stars (yeah), get ahead in fast cars (fast cars)
Shawty takin' them Xan bars (xan bars)
Shawty got a good hand job (hand), hand job, yeah, yeah
Go to Chanel and get ten slides (ten slides)
Came from the mud, I'm the man now (man now)
Bae, don't leave me, gotta believe me, I'm the man now
Lord, please (lord, please), you hear me pleadin' (uh, hear me pleadin')
My soul bleedin' (bleedin'), heart screamin' (heart screamin')
Fightin' demons (fightin'), right now, I need you, uh (I need you)
Tell bae, "Don't leave me" (don't leave me), bae, don't leave me, uh
Bae, don't leave me (bae, don't leave me), bae, don't leave me (bae, don't leave me)
Bae, don't leave me (bae, don't leave me), be, don't leave me (bae, don't leave me)
Bae, don't leave me (bae), bae, don't leave me (bae, don't leave me)
Bae, don't leave me (bae), bae, don't leave me, no, no
