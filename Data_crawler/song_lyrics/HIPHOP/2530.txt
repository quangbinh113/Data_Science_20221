Song Name: Myspace
(Damjonboi)
Bitch, I had a status before Tom added my MySpace
Condo out the way, when winter hit I'm finna migrate (brrrt)
My plays, my way, my chains, my pape', my apes, my drank
You wish that you was me, don't you?
Fly way the highway, pint help me hydrate
Got the game on lock, a hunnid M's, I got the key for you
You ain't a stacker, you got zero like Hector Zeroni (shit)
Clip glued to my pelvis, I step into Coney (brrt)
Lil' brodie Kenny Smith, how he jet in the stoley (skrrt)
Olympian, shit, how I'm feeling, my necklace a trophy
VVs got me chilly, shit, I caught the sniffles
J. Crawford, score a four off the dribble
In that Bat Mobile, we spinned the block, they tryna solve the riddle (what?)
Too official, all I'm missing is a ball and whistle
Shit, I'm speeding in the Demon, it's not a Camaro
Living like the mob, Goodfellas, I'm Robert Di Nero (the boss)
Rocking all this gold, I'm on top like a Pharaoh
Pull up to the spot to get some gas, this is not the Valero
When I'm rocking apparel, Yohji Yamamoto, boy, I be dropping dineros
Robbing through the hood, you might get shot with an arrow
I was Prada'd up, double strapped, you was rocking some Aero (yeah, yeah)
My plays, my weight, my chains, my pape', my apes, my drank
You wish that you me, don't you?
Fly way the highway, pint help me hydrate
Got the game on lock, a hunnid M's, I got the key for you
I'ma give it all I got 'til I drop
Fell asleep half way, couldn't even kill my pop
Boy, this bitch filled with Wock'
Gloves on, fill the chop
It could be ten years, bitch, you know you still a opp
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha
Look, bitch
Spikes on the Loubs look like a porcupine
Feel like D. Mitch, flying 'round with the .45
Two in the half pints, we poured up like 40 lines
Amphetamines, opioids
Catch him riding luxury and get his Rolls-Royce destroyed
We gon' park his shit
Out in Troy with a 60 on a Neiman Marcus trip
Shit, voices in my head, I feel like Randy Orton
Probably 'cause I'm off a ten, but brodie off the Xannies snoring
Bitch, I had a status before Tom added my MySpace
Condo out the way, when winter hit I'm finna migrate (brrrt)
My plays, my way, my chains, my pape', my apes, my drank
You wish that you was me, don't you?
Fly way the highway, pint help me hydrate
Got the game on lock, a hunnid M's, I got the key for you
Tripping on the road
Interview to a show, switching out my clothes
You asked the plug for 20 bags, I'm digging out the 'bow
Carties with the pointers, I got boogers dripping off my nose
Let me know, I'll flick that switch and get up in that mode
All these vanillas on me, feeling gifted in the store
Road runner, first dub, I did it in the O
Need a jersey that say "Maravich," how I pistol tote
Why the fuck he didn't shoot? I think his pistol broke
Jordan every time I drop, bitch, I'm 6-0
Bitch, I been the G.O.A.T
My plays, my way, my chains, my pape', my apes, my drank
You wish that you me, don't you? (You wish that you me, don't you?)
