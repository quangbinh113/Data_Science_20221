Song Name: Sleazy Flow
Okay
Everybody put they Glocks in the air for me
Let's air this shit out
You got a stick on your shit, you got a fifty on your shit, put your shit in the air for me
Ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy (uh)
Grrt (uh)
Last opp we caught was at the store, we had to straighten (skrrt)
Lil' bro hopped out trippin' with that switchy, he done faced him (grrt)
Face shot, face shot, frrt frrt, they couldn't save him
We the ones gettin' busy up in the city, that's on my baby (that's on my son)
They block like a drive-thru, ask the opps how much we slide through
Ain't beefin' with you, they family, they get caught, then you gon' die too (dumbass)
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, stop the whip
Let me out, this chopstick gon' leave him open likе a zip (zz)
Zip him up, tell buddy 'nem ass to come and pick him up (pick him up)
Niggas fakin', acting likе they thug life 'til we hit 'em up
Lot of niggas don't like me, for what? I ain't even did shit (I ain't even did nothin')
Make his bitch take dick to the head, I ain't even hit yet
How you mad she choosing me? I like what she do to me
She say she feel safer over here, this where the shooters be
She say ain't no pape' up over there, shit, she barely eatin' (starvin')
Can barely feed hisself, she told me help, this nigga barely feed me
We don't do the social tweet, these niggas too internet
Goin' live, tryna talk 'bout who got shot, we don't get into that
Can you leave it up in the streets for me? I ain't tryna go to jail
Keep mention my name in all of your posts, it ain't hard to tell (what the fuck?)
If you get smoked, they gon' come lookin' for me, nigga, you dumb as hell
This bitch think I love her, ooh-wee, she must be drunk as hell
I can't love no slut bitch, I love how they suck dick (I love how they eat dick)
Once I get my nut off, bitch, I'm skatin' like some TRUKFIT
You know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
(Grrt)
It's the Sleaze, fuckboy
