Song Name: Cooped Up (with Roddy Ricch)
I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I've been waitin' so long
Now I gotta re-surface
And yeah we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin'
'Cause I've been feelin' cooped up
I've been fuckin' cooped up
Yeah, I'm off the Bud Light not the bourbon
I might chop the roof off the Suburban
Tried to Bia Nice Guy, John Terzian
'Til I started throwin' up in your Birkin
Then I woke up in the mornin'
Police showed up at my door with a warrant
I remember flushin' somethin' down the toilet
Guess you gotta let me off with a warning, Return of Mack
Feelin' like an Outkast
I'm the only guy in slacks, that'll cost ya three stacks
Now you savin' that check
Why you takin' my swag? Can you give me that back?
Gucci my Prada, Miyake
Louis, Bottega, and Tommy
All of these things on my body
Let's party
I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain (hit switch, pull curtains)
And I've been waitin' so long
Now I gotta re-surface
And yeah we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin'
'Cause I've been feelin' cooped up
I've been fuckin' cooped up
Shit, gotta pull up, pull up, I'ma pull up, I pull up
Got black minx all on the rug
Got hella hoes popping drugs
In every hood, they show us love
Partner in crime with me while we whipping in the spaceship
Got it out the pavement, now we getting payment
Everybody around me getting money, it's too contagious
Kept it solid now we real rich to they amazement
I pulled up the black Badge 'cause it was cleaner
I 'member I was just posted up with the demons
And Posty took me on my first damn tour date
He had me rocking every night, sold out arenas
A project nigga, I never thought I would see shit
Or try to tell you, you probably wouldn't believe us
I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I've been waitin' so long
Now I gotta re-surface
And yeah we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin'
'Cause I've been feelin' cooped up
I've been fuckin' cooped up
'Til the daylight come, 'til the daylight come
I got sak√© in my tummy, cigarette in my lungs
It's 11 in the mornin', and we still ain't done
And I'm still that bitch, so what?
Yeah, we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin'
'Cause I've been feelin' cooped up
I've been fuckin' cooped up
