Song Name: shots in the dark (with Trippie Redd)
Yeah, yeah
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
You'll always be on the same shit, and I know
Bag full of wishes, but they seem to never work
It's crazy how fast you went from sweet to so cold
And now it's 'bout that time that I should really let it go
But I'll be back again, you're my medicine
I can't go a day without that feeling and you know
Feelings rolling in, back to feeling dead
Hard to understand it, but I'll never let you go
It's a twisted love (ooh-ooh)
Nothing here could save me
Don't feel right without you (ooh-ooh)
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
You used to say you're in love
But you're not, and that's okay
And I won't play it fair with your heart
Shawty my Mona Lisa, love all of her features, yeah (beautiful)
She a fine work of art
I completely understand that you're mine after dark
Know your mind, body, and soul ain't ready for the love scars
This Hennessy been liquid gold and it's cripped a broken heart
Tryna find your love again, yeah
It's a twisted love (ooh-ooh)
Nothing here could save me
Don't feel right without you (ooh-ooh)
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
Girl, you're leaving me scarred
Tears fall, it's hitting me hard
Bricks weighing down on my heart
Got me on edge
Didn't get the message at all
Now I'm taking shots in the dark
