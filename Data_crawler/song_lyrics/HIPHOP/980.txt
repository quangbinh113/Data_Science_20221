Song Name: Control The World (feat. Lil Wayne)
Baby, I cannot control the world when I can't even control myself
And I know this life was meant for me 'cause I can't be like someone else
Gettin' tired of all these twists and turns so I'ma really need yo' help
'Cause baby, I cannot control the world when I can't even control myself
It was a stormy night, not a star in the sky
Only stars you could see in the ceilin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her hold me tight and take a look in my eyes
Know you wonder the way that I'm feelin' (wonder the way)
If you are who I think you are, then you lend your hands to me
But you're not, so I think it's time to make up my mind and leave
'Cause I'm through with all you do to me
And it's true that love is all I need
Baby, I cannot control the world when I can't even control myself
And I know this life was meant for me 'cause I can't be like someone else
Gettin' tired of all these twists and turns so I'ma really need yo' help
'Cause baby, I cannot control the world when I can't even control myself (uh)

Can't even control myself
Talkin' to myself, like, "Self, don't ignore myself"
I told myself that I owe myself more of myself
This world crazy, like Miss Daisy, almost drove myself
I'm sure I need love, but not sure if I'm sure of myself
She full of herself, like the only one she for is herself
I'm warning myself, don't want myself to corner myself
Killin' myself, be the only one mournin' myself
I'm only myself, I be in my own zone in myself
Keep my thoughts to myself, I be tryna keep my heart to myself
It's an art in itself, but you could keep me all to yourself
'Cause baby (love is all I need, yeah yeah yeah)
Baby, I cannot control the world
When I can't even control myself (I cannot control the world, myself)
And I know this life was meant for me
'Cause I can't be like someone else (uh, yeah, be like someone else)
Gettin' tired of all these twists and turns
So I'ma really need yo' help (yeah, yeah, yeah, I really need your help)
'Cause baby, I cannot control the world
When I can't even control myself (yeah, I cannot control the world)
