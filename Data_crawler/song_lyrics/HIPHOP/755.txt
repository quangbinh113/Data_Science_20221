She look like a trampoline from the way she bouncin' (yeah, uh, yeah)
From the way she bouncin'
Labels want my music, tell the studio to bounce it
This shit isn't out yet

Real shit, never tell a lie, yeah, ay
Life's good, so I'm living great (great)
I hit up my lady, we should take a vacay
Eatin' good (ay), see it on our plate (yeah)
I know that they hate me, I see it on their face
