Song Name: E-ER (feat. Lil Yachty)
Y'all rocking with DJ Scheme, lil' bitch
I'm sippin' tea, beat what I eat
Kicked up the feet, no Assassin's Creed
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Good reflexes like you knocked at the knee
Accept defeat, you, I delete
My boots from Greece made with feathers from geese
Counting loose leaf with the face of deceased
Count up the bread, count up the yeast
This is for my nemesis, white folk
If you pull up, then you'rе dead, uh-uh, rifle
We gon' cross him likе the symbol on a Bible
Call him Spongebob 'cause he movin' life without spinal, huh
Never not woke, my gland pineal
On the patio fucking Princess's peach, Mario
Yellow Louis V overalls on me, look like Wario
On the mic, I'm an animal, hear the cardio through audio
If you want beef, capisce (hahaha)
Smokin' on tree, hashish (yow)
She said, "No, don't leave"
Baby, I'm oh-so green (what's that shit 'cause it better not be)
We got Dracs, sticks
All type of blicks (ooh-ooh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-eeh)
Blood on my back
Don't get caught in a blitz (ooh-ooh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-eeh)
Chopsticks, got me a pick (eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh)
Steppin' on shit, put my foot in a brick (eeh)
Fuck you mean? (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Huh, oh, I'm ready (haha)
Yuh (oh, shit), yuh
I'm in the land of the lost, now I'm chill, Jack Frost
Yeah, my conscience like Constantine, that hot sauce
Jack Skellington limbs 'cause I'm known to pop off
And I'm one with the force, so this saber is my sword
Got the dick tucked in like RuPaul
Two bananas and a boat in the U-Haul (huh)
And the dope look sick like Wuhan
'Nother brick comin' in from Tucson (racks)
I was too piffed up when a nigga walked in
I was servin' up bricks at a low end (white)
I got too much boof stuffed in my pants (huh, huh, huh, huh-huh-huh)
I could probably fuck around
Build a snowman (huh-huh-huh, huh-huh-huh)
And it's stone, no Mason, say I'm chillin' with your bitch
It's for him and her like Rozan
'Cause this shit go down when a nigga get wet
Should've never put your life in a ho hands
If you want beef, capisce (hahaha)
Smokin' on tree, hashish (yow)
She said, "No, don't leave"
Baby, I'm oh-so green (what's that shit 'cause it better not be)
We got Dracs, sticks
All type of blicks (ooh-ooh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-eeh)
Blood on my back
Don't get caught in a blitz (ooh-ooh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-eeh)
Chopsticks, got me a pick (eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh)
Steppin' on shit, put my foot in a brick (eeh)
Kick a bitch to the curb if she don't speak with manners (hee, hee)
My house sit alone behind gates by the manor (hee, hee)
My new hoes look whiter than Carlos Santana (hee, hee)
My bitch from the hood, mamas hustled on camera (hee, go)
School from the '70s
Could've been dropped by the first time I signed for my boy
That was English like city of Oxford
Just finessed some pussy, I need me an Oscar
I thought I want kids 'til I sat by a toddler
Recorded two hits in one hour at Doppler (two)
I walk in my house naked holding my chopper (frrt)
We do the same shit, we change names just like soccer
My jewelry box looking like Davy Jones' locker
I want Addison Rae to become my doctor
And check on my privates (woo)
Put her in a skirt and a scarf like a pilot
He didn't make it past the first clip like a pilot (frrt)
I'm sick, I need medicine before I riot
My bitch pussy sweet, it help with my diet
Can't go off the label, boy, I gotta eye it
I gotta smell, I gotta taste it
Haha, hahaha, yaow, frrt (on God, slatt)
What's this, what's this?
What's that shit 'cause it better not be
Eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh, eeh (go)
Eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh, eeh (slatt, damn)
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup
Hahaha, oh shit
