Song Name: i see london i see france
Huh, what's up? Just paid my phone bill
No fucks, red, blue, pop both pills
I'm up, still shop at Goodwill
Shut up, I'll sign my own deal
I see London, I see France
Your girl in her underpants
She said I'm a better man
At a nice place, getting tan
Type out money, come in bands
Don't think you understand
Fingers shining, diamond hands
Get my bag up every chance
Whoa, hot tub on the patio
Triple X like tic-tac-toe
Got some money but I think I need more
She caked up, got gâteau
Wear perfume, no cologne
Sip Tito's, no Patron
She my little bit' and I'm her bone
Don't let me get in my zone
Hey, fuck cancer
Million dollar baby bitch, I'm the answer
I bought a crib with a fence and a horse and a cow
And a pig and a big red barn, I'm a rancher
Just bought a camper, had to pimp the ride
And my sun sign Cancer, it's okay to cry
I'm a date romancer, we gettin' french fries
Yeah, I got good manners, I'm a nice guy
Now what's up? Just paid my phone bill
No fucks, red, blue, pop both pills
I'm up, still shop at Goodwill
Shut up, just signed my own deal
I see London, I see France
Your girl in her underpants
She said I'm a better man
At a nice place, getting tan
Type out money, come in bands
Don't think you understand
Fingers shining, diamond hands
Get my bag up every chance
Whoa, hot tub on the patio
Triple X like tic-tac-toe
Got some money but I think I need more
She caked up, got gâteau
Wear perfume, no cologne
Sip Tito's, no Patron
She my little bit' and I'm her bone
Don't let me get in my zone
I can get bagged up whenever I want to
Flunked outta college, only reason 'cause I had to
Fuck that alarm, I'ma wake up when I want to
Don't wait in lines, yeah, even if I need to
Chores do themself, yeah, I really don't want to
Bills paid first for the month 'cause I had to
I can do whatever I want when I want to
And there ain't a thing that I can't do that I have to
(Close that door) Yeah
I see London, I see France
Your girl in her underpants
She said I'm a better man
At a nice place, getting tan
Type out money, come in bands
Don't think you understand
Fingers shining, diamond hands
Get my bag up every chance
Whoa, hot tub on the patio
Triple X like tic-tac-toe
Got some money but I think I need more
She caked up, got gâteau
Wear perfume, no cologne
Sip Tito's, no Patron
She my little bit' and I'm her bone
Don't let me get in my zone
