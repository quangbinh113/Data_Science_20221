Song Name: Break from Toronto
P-P-P-P-P-PARTY
That smile on your face
Makes it easy to trust you
Those in (yeah)
Those in (yeah)
Those in (yeah)
This what 'Sauga feels like in the night time
Watch what she doin' when the light shine
Drunk niggas tryin' a talk in the strip club
Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign
C-Caught up (caught up)
That's just how a nigga brought up (brought up)
Blow ones for you loony ass niggas (ass niggas)
Straight bills for you Toonie ass niggas (ass niggas)
M-M-My niggas bigger than the bouncer
Roll up in the bitch still smell like an ounce (like an ounce)
Right quick, right quick
Tight jeans on so she feels my shit, ayy (feel my shit)
Tell me something good, baby
Tell me something, tell me something good, shawty
Come bring it to the hood, baby
Bring it-bring it back to hood shawty
This what 'Sauga feels like in the night time (night time)
Bust it up with shawty when the light shines (the light shines)
Still fuckin' with the same ass niggas
I know you want a break
I-I-I know you want a break from Toronto
Oh-oh (girl)
West side
Oh-oh, ooh, girl
Oh-oh
That smile on your face
Those in
Those in
Just makes it
Just makes it
Those in
Those in
