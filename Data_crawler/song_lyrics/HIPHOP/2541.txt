Song Name: Nice Guy
Yeah Rif
We undefeated with this shit nigga for real
I ain't used to have shit so I count
(I ain't used to have shit so now nigga get everything man)
Aye Rif what the fuck man you know what's goin on with us man
I ain't used to have shit I count it up when I'm bored
Beans in the cup holder the chopstick on the floor
Locked in ballin' on em I ain't looked at the sco (Locked In)
Ever-fresh cran-apple see brick when I po' (Rest In Peace)
Bought me an ounce and went to post up at the store (For Real)
Goyard bag that's just for the money to hold it
Fifteen hoes I come in thru the back like the owner
New M8 you can tell it's that from the motor
Tired of being the nice guy overlooking shit
Nigga tried to play slick once so we took his shit
I shouldn't even have to tell you baby pull up sucking dick
I could switch my wrist switch the whip switch the blick
Tired of being the nice guy overlooking shit
Nigga tried to play slick once so we took his shit
I shouldn't even have to tell you baby pull up sucking dick
I could switch my wrist switch the whip switch the blick
I got a personal shopper ain't hit the mall in a while now
Say she squirt but not on me put a towel down
Fuck yo man I got enough to turn your frown around
Fake ass thugs ain't on shit must be Ramadan
This shit is in me not on me shit is on me too
Plenty missions with my dog I'm a call him scooby
It ain't nothing that's more important than money yeah scooter
Spin that block got hit up quick my youngin Zab Judah
Money stacked to the ceiling nigga grab a ruler
Boy is you a dealer or a user
Watch them gold diggers cause them bitches be abusing
Thinking I should take ya care of her and she don't do shit
Touch one of my loved ones imma lose it
We can't catch him hope yo family moving
FBI list listen this shit deeper than music
Doped up playing with the dope I feel like Pookie
You know I'm doped up playing with the dope this how I do it
Money counter plugged up this shit therapeutic
I'll turn top notch boss hoe was a student
Stole my pops truck when he left he never knew it
She could put me in special ed I'm going stupid
I ain't mad at you baby girl cause niggas groupies
Thirteen in the basement when I'm in Houston
Niggas greet me with open arms and I love it
See niggas around me yeah I love em'
I hope you get back on your feet when you fallin'
You know I love things about her but I don't love her
Tired of being the nice guy overlooking shit
Nigga tried to play slick once so we took his shit
I shouldn't even have to tell you baby pull up sucking dick
I could switch my wrist switch the whip switch the blick
Tired of being the nice guy overlooking shit
Nigga tried to play slick once so we took his shit
I shouldn't even have to tell you baby pull up sucking dick
I could switch my wrist switch the whip switch the blick
Face Mob nigga
