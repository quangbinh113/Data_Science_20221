Song Name: Put The Minks Down (feat. 42 Dugg)
Ayo (ayo)
Tell them to put the minks down on the floor (tell them to put the minks down on the floor)
So, we can walk in here like Kings (so we can walk in here like Kings)
Big steppas only (big steppas only)
Dugg, what up, dog? (Dugg, what up, dog?)
Snowman holla at me (Snowman holla at me)
Put the minks down
No, for real summertime all the freaks out (freaks out)
Nottingham still slapping off of three five
Young nigga probably beat the feds three times (three times)
And I kept it solid, nigga, each time
I'm 10 out of 10 still trying to free mines
This ain't a regular Benz, it's a S6 (S6)
Get money, fuck hoes, and stretch shit (stretch shit)
Y'all ain't even see my best yet

I ain't even gotta check niggas
One thing for certain, a nigga play with me, he die in a hurry (in a hurry)
50k a piece, bro fighting a murder and they retired my jersey
But I still get off the bench (get off the bench)
Glock teal with a switch, still hitting licks
Everybody calling Dugg da nigga
Big homie, but the littlest nigga
Living legend in the flesh (flesh)
Had a million dollars back when I was wearing Guess (damn)
250 three times, guess I had a Nina left
Hundred in the dope panel, got it leaning the left (haha)
Pyrex glass handle, yeah, shout out to my chef (chef)
Kitchen fork, warm water, yeah, shout out to myself (woo)
Send it on a paper towel, but I'ma need some plastic (plastic)
Weight these flip those, yeah, we doing gymnastics, on me (yeah)
Count a million with my eyes close
And I can whip a whole one with a blindfold (blindfold)
And I can, get it to ya nigga next day, air (air)
Where ya at nigga, next day, there (haha)
Black tape nigga grey tape, seal (seal)
Street razor with the V cut, peel (peel)
God bless ya, here's a scorpion stamp (stamp)
Young Virgil, yeah, the Off-White, champ
If somebody woulda told me two decades ago (if somebody woulda told me two decades ago)
That that music we was makin' in the 44 (that that music we was makin' in the 44)
Will be ringing off in front of 25 thousand (will be ringing off in front of 25 thousand)
Night after night (night after night), all cell phone lights up (all cell phone lights up)
Word for word like a religion (word for word like a religion)
