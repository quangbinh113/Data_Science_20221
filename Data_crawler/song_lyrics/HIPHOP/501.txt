Song Name: Calm Down (Bittersweet) [feat. Summer Walker]
We got London on da Track

Can we calm down and make love?
Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Nah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (Yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (Yeah)
Oh, you're dangerous
Perfect hips in every single pic, you got your angles up
I admit that I am not the best for you
No lie, feel fake as fuck (Yeah)
And you don't even smile no more, why so serious?
And you don't even wanna come around no more
Can you just wait up?
I can make you feel like a star if I fuck you in a spaceship
That new-new double R truck so spacious
And I know we stay up
But can we calm down and make love? (Make love)
Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck ('Ley truck)
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Nah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (Yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (Yeah)
Oh
Why not come over? Ride me just like I'm a Maserati
Go fast or go slow
I think the feds is watching, they think I be catching bodies
And if they ask just say that I was a nice guy
Then I touch you, a muh'fuckin' thief in the nighttime
Make it scary like sci-fi
Got a .30 on me, ain't got time for a knife fight
Even when it's nighttime
My VVS is shimmery like a nightlight
And she wanna act shy (Can)
I could be your connection like I'm WiFi (We calm down)
Just tryna get high (And make love)
Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Nah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (Yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (Yeah)
Oh
We got London on da Track
