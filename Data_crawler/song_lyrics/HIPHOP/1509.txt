Song Name: Immaculate
(What's good? Gio's good)
Duh, duh, duh (haha)
Duh, duh, duh (what it do Gio?)
Duh, duh, duh (yeah)
Duh, duh, duh (huh)
I'm smoking, and rolling, and choking
My mind don't be open for none of that bullshit
While I run to the ocean my feet in slow-motion
Somebody come help me I'm tripping
Just give me one moment, I'm full of emotion
My cup full with poison, I'm sipping
I put trust in myself and nobody else (Why?)
Especially these women (Why?)
They lie, and they steal, and they cheat
I don't know why these niggas can't see
I don't know why these bitches can't leave
I fuck 'em, and dump 'em, I pass, I leave
I'm a Mr. Let a Bitch Breathe
I'm immaculate hoe I got steez (steez)
And I'm passionate bro I got keys (come here)
I be packing shit down to my knees
Pray to God everyday I'm like "please" (please)
When I die don't put me on no tees (no)
I might smoke a nigga for the free (free)
I might rob a nigga for the cheese (cheese)
In all black and I match with my bitch (bitch)
And my diamonds in love with my wrist (wrist)
If I miss then I'm switching this clip
I might pull up and cause a little miss
This is my life and everybody looking at me like who did it?
These bitches be timid and wicked
All in my business (shhh)
All of my niggas be sleeping they only wake up at night
Don't you fuck with me you might go die tonight
I'm posted with choppa's I might go and drop 'em
Just fuck all that talking
You cuffing these bitches they giving me noggin, noggin
I know I got options
I'm posted with Haitians and all of my Asians
You faking and taking
Give a fuck about everyone else I'm not playing
And I know I'm amazing
Baby girl I'm all alone (where you at?)
I'm losing my patience (patience)
I'm looking for roaches, so please do not open (open)
I'm stuck in this pain
I'm in love with my ways
I'm in love with my habit (habit)
I had on my jacket (jacket)
Someone just told me I'm deep in a hole (hole)
I'm trynna let go (go)
I'm trynna get out
It's all in my head (head)
It's leaving me dead (dead)
I'm smoking, and rolling, and choking
My mind don't be open for none of that bullshit (yuh)
While I run to the ocean my feet in slow-motion
Somebody come help me I'm tripping (tripping)
Just give me one moment, I'm full of emotion
My cup full with poison, I'm sipping
I put trust in myself and nobody else (Why?)
Especially these women (Why?)
They lie, and they steal, and they cheat
I don't know why these niggas can't see
I don't know why these bitches can't leave
I fuck 'em, and dump 'em, I pass, I leave
I'm a Mr. Let a Bitch Breathe
I'm immaculate hoe I got steez (steez)
And I'm passionate bro I got keys (come here)
I be packing shit down to my knees
Pray to God everyday I'm like "please" (please)
When I die don't put me on no tees (no)
I might smoke a nigga for the free (free)
I might rob a nigga for the cheese (cheese)
In all black and I match with my bitch (bitch)
And my diamonds in love with my wrist (wrist)
If I miss then I'm switching this clip
I might pull up and cause a little drip (eheh)
