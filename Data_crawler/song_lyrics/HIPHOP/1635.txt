Song Name: Understand
I need a bitch that's gon' understand
Yeah, uh
Ain't hard to understand, I swear to God
Yeah
Yeah (oh-ah)
I need me a bitch that understand
I ain't got no plan but put you in a Lamb'
Take you to the tropics, somewhere you can get a tan, okay, bae
Baby I, I know you don't understand, but
Baby, I, I know you don't understand
Shawty, you don't understand
How I drip you in the merry and the summerland
I'm hands on but you got me on the other hand
And you the shit, girl, you know you need a plumber
And you know I got a hundred for you, know I got this money for you
Know I put the cease and desist for them bitches comin' for you
Know I pull up on you in a Lambo, bull up on the logo
Whole squad up, I got the hood on a pogo
Jet boys, wishin' that they could, it's a no-no
Fat paper cash, I'm still stackin' on the low though
Flew her out to Mexico, we made a Mayakoba
Hit her with the spice, I remind her of Adobo
Bad bitch, you know a nigga name
Whether if you lowkey or on the 'Gram with a lil' fame
Baby bands or a lil' change
If you wanna fuck, I wan' fuckin' same thing, okay
I need me a bitch that understand
I ain't got no plan but put you in a Lamb'
Take you to the tropics, somewhere you can get a tan, okay, bae
Baby I, I know you don't understand, but
Baby I, I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand
You don't understand why I pull up in that pull up
Or why I get inside and I start to throw my hood up
Rich bone did fuck me once, I give you good love
Wishbone, have a bitch wishin' that she could've
Fishbones all up in their head, too brazy
Had to shoot the shot, green meter, 2K
Hit me when you free, the girl sayin', "Today"
Hit me when you free, you know I hit you on a two way
Bad lil' bitch, her clique got it on the Blu-Ray
5-4-3, got it poppin' on a Tuesday
Bitch all in my bed and I ain't stoppin' like a loose break
Tryna slice in it like a motherfuckin' new cake
Ayy, cake, cake
Make a bitch squirt now my A.K.A
The bitch I'm pointin' out with my index
Turn to Windex when a nigga make her spray, ayy-ayy-ayy
I need me a bitch that understand
I ain't got no plan but put you in a Lamb'
Take you to the tropics, somewhere you can get a tan, okay, bae
Baby I, I know you don't understand, but
Baby I, I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand (you don't understand)
I know you don't understand
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
(I know you don't understand)
