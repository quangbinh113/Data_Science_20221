Song Name: Racks in the Middle (feat. Roddy Ricch and Hit-Boy)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' 'round in the
V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12
With the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay
I was riding 'round in the V-12
With the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God
They let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud
You can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop
Tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused
On my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped
Around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)
We was lurking on her
Ain't show no mercy on her
We was goin' back to back
We put a curfew on her
It was dark clouds on us
But that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn
But it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double
Check the details
Gotta cross my T's and dot my
I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the
Day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin' battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve
It was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look
I was riding 'round in the V-12
With the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God
They let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud
You can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops
With the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check
(Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck
(Mhmmhm)
Tryan put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)
Look, under no condition
Would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the
Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it
They'll send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin'
Court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Sip Dior with the flowers
Five gold cubans
Champagne while I shop
Hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month
Both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin'
After banging all them years?
Grammy nominated
In the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and
I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you
"Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started
Reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 to the pipe and smoke"
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12
With the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they
Let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud
You can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops
With the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused
On my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped
Around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryan put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)
Another million dollar bail
That's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet
Some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas
With my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise
Take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Just like money know money, nigga
Shooters respect other shooters
We was both
Don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop
It got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
