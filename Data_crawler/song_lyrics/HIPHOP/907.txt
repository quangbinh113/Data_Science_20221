Song Name: 24 Hours (feat. Lil Durk)
How you gon' treat me like I'm see-through?
Seven days a week, I wanna
Baby, when I see you, I'ma
These bitches always want somethin' from me
It's way different every time it's me and you
You loved me when I was bummy, now I got money
Baby, let me freeze you
I said, "Get your pretty ass right here, 'cause I miss you"
Get up in your bag, ass fat, Gucci swimsuit
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
And you keep on thinkin' how these other niggas did you
You don't even wanna call my line
Turned sherm 'causе you said, "I wanna fuck all day"
Saint Laurent on but I'm a Louis wearin' ass nigga
Burned Truе Religions, been slumped Balmains
Singin' nigga but I will get you rolled on
Don't make my niggas feel a way, ain't hurt no one in so long
They wanna off me
But I got so much money, if I react, they'll say I'm so wrong
(You loved me when I was bummy, now I got money)
(Baby, slide by)
Don't you play with me, I wanna see you
How you gon' treat me like I'm see-through? (See-through)
500,000 dollar cars when I pleased you (500,000 dollars)
24 hours, baby, 12 times two (24 hours, baby)
Seven days a week, I wanna see you (seven days a week, I wanna)
How you gon' treat me like I'm see-through? (When I see you)
500,000 dollar cars when I pleased you (500,000 dollars)
24 hours, baby, 12 times two (24 hours, baby)
I be tellin' you all the things I wanna do to you
Kissin' on the inside of your thighs, got you swimming pool
Lickin' every hole on your body, got you shakin' too
Like when you in control of the bed, look what you make me do
Kiss me, lick me, hug me, fuck me, while I
Get the Maybach truck, she said, "It's ugly, but I'll try"
Tell you, "I love you" before I take off, ain't no Wi-Fi
Soon as I land, I check my texts and the reply
The trenches, I love you, ain't got no bitches
Let's get it, got a real nigga in they feelings
I'm healin', I just wanna see you, I ain't really with the distance
Wanna lick between all your toes, not to mention
I seen her with her wig off, she comfortable
I never cared about your past or who was fuckin' you
And I know that shit forever when I'm touchin' you
Put my daughter in your stomach at the W
I wanna see you
How you gon' treat me like I'm see-through?
500,000 dollar cars when I pleased you (500,000, baby)
24 hours, baby, 12 times two (24 hours, baby)
Seven days a week I wanna see you (seven days a week, I wanna see you)
How you gon' treat me like I'm see-through? (When I see you)
500,000 dollar cars when I pleased you (500,000)
24 hours, baby, 12 times two (24 hours, baby)
Seven days a week, I wanna (seven days a week, I wanna)
I just want you to know
You don't even wanna call me "Artist" no more
That type of bitch that can't nobody own
Gettin' money, that type of time she be on
What's up?
You know I'm ballin' but I miss ya
