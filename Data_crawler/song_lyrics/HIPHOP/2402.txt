Song Name: WHEN THE DEVIL CRIES
Yeah, ayy
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
When the devil cries, will you let him in?
If it was dark outside, would you let me in?
Are you scared of what the love will bring?
If you were back in time, would you start again?
When the devil cries, will you let him in?
If it was dark outside, would you let me in?
Are you scared of what the love will bring?
If you were back in time, would you start again?
When the devil cries, will you let him in?
If it was dark outside, would you let me in?
Are you scarеd of what the love will bring?
If you werе back in time, would you start again?
Now I'm running from society
And I'm hiding from sobriety
'Cause the real world brings anxiety
And I just suffer silently
When the devil cries, will you let him in?
If it was dark outside, would you let me in?
Are you scared of what the love will bring?
If you were back in time, would you start again?
If the devil cries, can I call your line?
And tell you what's been on my mind
Breaking down in the daylight
You're my medicine, but you act as cyanide
I'm a lost soul going on a joyride
Can you kiss me again for the last time?
When the devil cries, when the devil cries
When the devil cries, when the devil cries
When the devil cries, if the devil cries
When the devil cries, will you call my line?
