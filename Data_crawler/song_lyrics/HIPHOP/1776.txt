Song Name: GOD SAVE THE STREETS PT. 2
Woke up extra early just to give thanks
I just got the new Range, man was on the ridgeback
Really tryna pedal-to-the-metal, so I did trap
Being impatient nearly had a lasting impact
But I saw death, saw jail, and I skipped that
I'm my own worst enemy and it's a mismatch
Yeah
Rolexes, fuck a wristband, it's triple AV
Anywhere I go, I bring gang
God save the streets
All these gains were painful
Now ain't a day that I'm weak
Got everything that I prayed for
Still man are preying on me
God save the streets
Been through hell and it made a beast
Incredible scenes
Got targets, so they aim at me, yeah
Love when they hate on me
Ran from feds, but I chase my dreams
Work on me, I had to work
Dropped that out, so this had to work, hmm
Look what I had to earn
Young fire, can't crash and burn
God save the streets
I was in trance, trapping when I got the chance
Yeah
God the save the streets
Partying with arms, safe to say he had a blast
Yo
God save the streets
Fucking with the family, blud, I'll take that shit to heart
Got it off the scale, now we're lit, it's off the charts
They been trying to end us from the start
Yeah
On your marks
Get you set up, keep it calm, hmm
Streets is dark
When you're on the streets with dark, hmm
Gotta feed the fam
But the greed will you eat up
Got you tryna hit the belly
With them junkies moving junk
Yeah, that new pack packs a punch
Mandem never left the country but were always out in cunch
In the kitchen bagging up, serving food for their lunch
Take away your re-up money, multiply add it up
There's no divide when you come roll with mine, yeah
Trapping on stolen bikes, uh, living on borrowed time
Line banging, phone decline
There weren't no call-waiting them times, hmm
The strip was dry, drought got everything overpriced
I'm looking at man with jewels
Thinking I'm supposed to shine as well
I was low, getting high as hell
But not off the shit that I'd buy and sell
Stood by the snail
Slugs in the round, they slide with shells
When there's man on the road tryna find you
You can't find the time to find yourself
God save the streets
I was in trance, trapping when I got the chance
Yeah
God the save the streets
Partying with arms, safe to say he had a blast
Yo
God save the streets
Fucking with the family, blud, I'll take that shit to heart
Got it off the scale, now we're lit, it's off the charts
They been trying to end us from the start
Know what you're doing when you play the streets
Really out here, we play to keep
See my man, just 'llow the speech
Put to the test, he ain't about that street
One in his chest, sit down and leak
This 40 cal will cow this beef
Tired of playing with machine
Step out of place, I page him mean
Ever had a 12 gauge in your jeans
Pull that out and shell the scene
Pick up the shells, ain't taking a L
Licking them sales, living in jails
Name ring bells in HMP
Age of 15, paper was the main issue
Ever touch something close range
And seen the brain tissue
Really wanna dead for this game
And take the game with you
The gyal will set you up
On the same night that she lay with you
Bruddas are snakes, they'll lick you down
And the man that prayed with you
Poke out your chest, man will lick that down
Won't take that brave with you
Are your bros your bros when it come to the end
Will they dig that grave with you?
Beat life, bro got a 30 with the same issue
