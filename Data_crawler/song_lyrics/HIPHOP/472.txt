Song Name: 772 Love
Ayy
Uh, uh, oh, oh
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
Girl, you know I love it when I'm next to you
Ridin' through the 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
We found love in 772
She straight up outta 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
We found love in 772
She straight up outta 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
Niggas don't know, they don't need to know
Rolled up a four, slide through the four
Ride through it slow
Damn my lil' hoe, she roll up my dope
We get high, then we float
Don't smoke with no pole, she askin' for more
I'm givin' her more
More of my love
Hop inside my car and take control of my love
For her I would kill, for her I would drill
She know that it's real, she know that I feel
I love when she feel
Girl, you know I love it when I'm next to you
Ridin' through the 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
We found love in 772
She straight up outta 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
We found love in 772
She straight up outta 772
The feelings that I got for you is true
So baby, let me cater to you
Let me cater to you, so baby, let me cater to you
Let me cater to you, 'cause baby, this is your day
Do anything for your love, baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I'm dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, so baby, let me cater to you
Let me cater to you, so baby, let me cater to you
We found love in 772
So baby, let me cater to you
