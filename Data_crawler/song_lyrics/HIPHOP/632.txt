Song Name: School Girl
Love just what it do, girl
In love just with a school girl
But I ride with 22s, girl
With you it's déjà vu, girl
A model play with you, girl
In love just with a school girl
Fool me once and fool me twice
You fuck with my whole world
Shame on me and blame on me
But, baby, you my girl
Love for my brothers plus my motherfuckin' sisters
Bitch, I'm 18 and I made seven fuckin' figures
Why you so in denial, in denial?
Hold me close, yeah, 'til tomorrow
It's me, it's never you
I say, "Lil' baby, a throwback"
Lean in and kiss you, your lips chapped
You do your games and I play that
Without you, my world is pitch black
Hoes, they fold like clothes
How she move, it shows
Hoes, they fold like clothes
How she move, it shows
Yeah
Love just what it do, girl
In love just with a school girl
But I ride with 22s, girl
With you was déjà vu, girl
A model play with you, girl
In love just with a school girl
