Song Name: i don't want another sorry
After they hurt you the first time
Leave (ayy, this a Trademark production)
'Cause if they'll do it once (Stillsanexile)
They'll do it again
Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry (uh)
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end (yo, uh)
Two wrongs don't make a right
I turned left
Now you mad I don't pick up
I don't return texts
Like I'm supposed to, let it slide, what? And just forget
That you destroyed everything we had, what? Just for sex
Fuck that
I'm angry, I'm depressed and I'm mad
Reminiscing over days, living life in the past
How'd you do that shit? Was I really that bad?
I even let you stay
I even let you meet my dad
I don't know where we goin' but I know
That you're not for me, you're not for me
Aye, yo, aye, yo
Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry (uh)
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
I'm sorry, it was a mistake
Every fucking day another heartbreak
I can't take this pain, how much my heart aches
There won't be nothing left
Said you not sorry, I'm not sorry either
Told you I would love you to the moon and to the ether
Yeah, she think that I'm stupid and I peep her
Better off alone, by myself, I need to leave her, yeah, uh
Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry (uh)
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
