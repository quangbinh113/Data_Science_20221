Song Name: Last Day In
Oh, man, you know
Everybody been like goin' crazy with this auto-tune and shit
I don't need no tunes for the auto
All I'm missin' is you
I done made it out that fire like it's magic
If you ain't with me, I don't wanna see you happy
I'm just tryna spend my Easter in Miami
My baby told me stay out the way and stick to rappin', yeah
Now why you got the money for if you gon' waste it?
Lil' Kodak, ain't you tired of livin' crazy? Boy, you famous now
I'm just tryna spend my Easter in Miami
And I need it on my first day out, bitch, that's my last day in
I'm in all kind of shit, I'm chillin' at the Days Inn
I've been prospering, prayin' I don't get prosecuted
I can't believe that you can really leave me lonely
You don't even call to see if a nigga hungry (yeah)
I done stood up in that water with all kind of divers
I done made it out that fire, like a firefighter
I'm in Cleveland quarantining with a baddie
Ducked off, we ain't poppin' out until they find a vaccine, yeah
I told my lawyer, "Boy, I love you like a daddy"
And I'ma catch a charge before I let them take advantage of me
I done came home so much, I already know they tired of me
Ran up out of prison, I ain't say bye to nobody
I want sushi then some coochie, no more lunch trays, yeah
Had to stop showin' everybody where my momma stay, yeah
Trump just freed me, but my favorite president is on the money
All that hate and prejudice has become evident to me
Tryna quit takin' trips with the Carbon
But I know you niggas won't miss the chance if you could harm me, yeah
This my first day out, bitch, I want a head massage
Ain't no rumor, I keep shooters in my entourage (mm)
Got the white bitch talkin' like a nigga hoe
I be runnin' with the Z's, like I'm Piccolo (mm)
Spend my Christmas in Miami, yeah, Caresha Brownlee
They ain't even wait 'til you went to prison, they left you in the county
I been savin' up the money on my Sundays
Know you only wish for you to see me sufferin'
Whatever I spend on you is less than what you makin' me
Who spent the biggest bag on you? Girl, don't play with me
'Cause I don't want to have to show you that I love you, baby
If you ever cheat on me, guess what I'm gon' do, baby?
I don't know, I think it's over for this rap game shit
This my first day out the joint, so that my last day in
Yeah so, I was on the horn with my momma
You know, that's my Z queen
And she like, "Son, you got a beautiful voice"
I was blowing to her, sayin' this to her and shit
Say this my last day in, know what I'm sayin'?
Yo ta tiye m tou, ton√® kraze m pap pran prizon
Yeah so, creatin' a healthy and a happy lifestyle
I'm so proud of myself and how far I've come
Always kept it real even when no one's lookin'
