Song Name: Not My N*gga
Say he like him a thick bitch
Like a bitch with her own shit
I ain't never been a broke bitch
I been having motion, five stars, we toasting
I've been on some 304 shit
(And I like my head) slow, sloppy, shaky, leaky
It's getting loud, gotta take it easy
Gushy, soaking, freaky-deaky
Got that No Caller ID me
First, he sent a car to pick me up (then what?)
Girl, why that nigga flew me private? (Stop lying)
Hopped off, then he took me shopping
Next thing you know, we was laying on a island (ooh!)
I froze my neck like winter, I'm rich like I'm a Jenner
And if you see us out (shh), no, he is not my nigga
Staying with a bitch, say he do it for the kids
No, hе is not my nigga
Posing on the car when he knowing it ain't his
No, hе is not my nigga
When I'm riding that dick, he be saying that it's his
No, he is not my nigga
He'll do it for the bro's 'fore he do it for his bitch
Not, not my nigga
Nigga, I don't wanna hear, it is you rich or not?
I never heard a rich nigga say they cost a lot
Ayy bae, is you the runner, or you send them out?
Hey, is she in her feelings or is she sitting out?
Real freak, you could eat it through the Fenty
This some good-good, that Bobby, that Whitney
I don't do Miami unless you do it like Diddy
I don't do dates that's outside of my city
And you knowing I'ma act up, run that motherfucking sack up
Only thing I'm in is the Benz or the black truck
Sorry to the bitches, it was really giving lack-lust'
He miss me, girl, you really was the backup
Ooh, know it hurt his pride when I dissed him
Make him drown in his tears, need that tissue
Magazine, I'm a bad lil' issue
Only picking up on the first
(And I like my head) slow, sloppy, shaky, leaky
It's getting loud, gotta take it easy
Gushy, soaking, freaky-deaky
Got that No Caller ID me
Staying with a bitch, say he do it for the kids
No, hе is not my nigga
Posing on the car when he knowing it ain't his
No, hе is not my nigga
When I'm riding that dick, he be saying that it's his
No, he is not my nigga
He'll do it for the bro's 'fore he do it for his bitch
Not, not my nigga
Not, not my nigga
