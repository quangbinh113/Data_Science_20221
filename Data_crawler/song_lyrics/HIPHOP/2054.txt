Song Name: Sharing Locations (feat. Lil Baby & Lil Durk)
KJ, what you got goin' on man?
Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap
I got a lil' b- from the hood
I call her, "Gang," she don't play with that bae
I be - this NBA -
'Cause she know I ain't ever gon' say -
New contract big like I play ball
Lil' boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
I told her, "Pull up," she told me she can't
Her - be sharin' location
Yeah, I was ridin' in the Ghost with the ghost gun
Seen you out with your kids so you owe one
Had my man in the can while you takin' out the trash
You gon' pop with the MAC like, don't run
Gave her a pill, they all get high, you ever had a foursome?
This too much cash for me to hide, I had to give lil' bro some
I - her raw from time to time, I don't show no emotion
But when he died, he had them racks, he had to make it go for him
I hang with the hitters who train the
Killers who send all the - on store runs
I got me a check and I brought me a 'cat
And I went on the block and did donuts
I hang with all the murderers
I'm payin' all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm puttin' all my dice on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers
Yeah, Rolls Royce, swervin', famous, famous curvin'
Seen you out in traffic, you was lookin' nervous
Ran it up on accident then they thought it was on purpose
I know for a fact I'm blastin', man, I never get too worried
Hunnid racks in hunnids, they like cursive, I been sellin' verses
One time, I like the sound of my song, I ain't gonna buy her no Birkin
Homicide on my mind when I slide, I ain't tryna see no hearses
He ain't even die by the gun, took a fake pill, - died off Percs
Shawty look perfect (perfect)
- Was workin', go get her some purses
My diamonds be hittin' like we in a Versuz
We stickin' together, this - ain't a custom
I'm - with Durkio
I get like the jeweler with Baby, bought two anniversaries
We go to Atlanta, then we coppin' a Kobe (brother)
Bad lil', bad lil' all over me
Way too ranked up, ain't no exposin' me (no way)
She wanna go to the mall (let's get it)
Got up and went to the pop-up in Louis and saw it and ordered it all
I'm in this - with the voice and the hero
These - is weirdos, ain't goin' this hard (no way)
I'm from the P, that's the gang
All these - know me, I hang with
I hang with all the murderers
I'm payin' all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm puttin' all my dice on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers
Murderers
Murderers
I hang with all the murderers
Murderers
