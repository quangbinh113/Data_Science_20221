Song Name: Wild Irish Roses
Yeah, I was there, backwoods (backwoods)
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
Pick a couple of Wild Irish Roses
You lookin' mmm-mmm-mmm delectable
Made arrangements for that edible
Double booked if it's cool, your friend can roll through
Casa su casa, how's your Spanish?
You kick it off, home field advantage
Got Gatorade on ice, lil boo, stay cool
Second stop we done made
Can't find no Woods and it's gettin' late
I might just pull over
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Lil shawty got me standin' at attention
Ciudado
This that two-a-days bench press repetition
Equinox oops, I mean Equinox
Smeezy F Baby and the F is for the Faneto
Triangles, down, up, circle
My dick a cheat code, I stick for the joy
She sayin' it's sweet, callin' me chico
I dig in her earth deep, she quaking
I'm from juptr, baby get with an alien
Crazy, I popped a little somethin'
I'm seein' 3D
We saw Nefertiti, you won't believe me
Posted up like a lamp, come rub on a genie
I know you wish for forever, ever, you see me
My stones rolling but fuck it, you rockin' with me
Yeah you rockin' with me
Somethin' 'bout yah lil' convo, you do somethin' for me
And I ain't cold with geometry but you a cute mothafucka
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
Pick a couple of Wild Irish Roses
You lookin' mmm-mmm-mmm delectable
Made arrangements for that edible
Double booked if it's cool, your friend can roll through
Casa su casa, how's your Spanish?
You kick it off, home field advantage
Got Gatorade on ice, lil' boo, stay cool
Second stop we done made
Can't find no Woods and it's gettin' late
I might just pull over
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
