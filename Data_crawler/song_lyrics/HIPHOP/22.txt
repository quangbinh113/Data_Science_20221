Tone that shit down (oh, why?)
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down (huh, hol' up, it's Gucci)
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Huh, pull up, fros up, with the door up
Chopper in the club, I don't care who show up
Watch lookin' like a glow up, when I throw up
East side Bouldercrest Road where I growed up
Hold up, lil' homie tone it down
'Cause the jewelry that you rockin' is for the kids I'm a grown up
Sat courtside right next to the owner
Lookin' so good, make his wife pick her phone up (wow)
Big gold boulders, in my Rollie
Look like Fred Flintstone when he pick a stone up
If everybody got a watch like that
Then why would I want that watch? I'm a loaner
Damn near had the temper tantrum
'Cause he got that car 'fore I got it, now I really don't wanna
Y'ain't never seen a nigga glow up like this
Not a nigga that was trappin' on a corner (it's Gucci)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
Might steal your bitch (might steal your bitch)
Wop, wop, wop, wop
Yeah, yeah, VVS the wrist
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
Might steal your bitch (huh)
Tone that shit down
Y'ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (oh, why?)
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who gon' ball like this (huh, go)
Gucci Mane and CB, jewelry lookin' 3D
Tryna be like me, ain't easy (wow)
Niggas hate me, women wanna date me
'Cause I got all these VVS pieces (yah)
In that great thing
2018 Rolls Royce truck, no reason (huh)
Water on my time piece wetter than a Fiji
Parked front of the St. Regis (burr)
Artists wanna meet me
Ballin' like an athlete, but I ball all four seasons (ooh)
Diamonds dancing just like Breezy (damn)
Take it easy Breezy, go easy (ha)
Big stones in all my pieces (ha)
Gucci Mane stunt like Meechie (Meechie)
Jewelery so gold, I'm sneezin'
Pull up South Beach, no ceiling
Tone that shit down
Y'ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (oh, why?)
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Yeah, four, four, drippin'
I be on a hunnids spokes
Fire weed, hit it
Have a nigga seeing ghosts
Tell me what it do 'cause I'm tryna get to know you
Champagne, takin' shots
Won't have a hangover (yeah)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
Might steal your bitch (might steal your bitch)
Wop, wop, wop, wop
Yeah, yeah, VVS the wrist
Wop, wop, wop, wop (huh)
Might steal your bitch (huh)
Tone that shit down
Y'ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (oh, why?)
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who gon' ball like this
Tone that shit down

Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who gon' ball like this
