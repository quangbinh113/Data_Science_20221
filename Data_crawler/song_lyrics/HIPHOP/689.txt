Song Name: Lemonade
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had
Hey, hey
Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

All this money, when I grew up, I had nothing (nothing)
Filled with backstabbers, my old life was disgusting (disgusting)
Can't believe it, gotta thank God that I'm living comfortably (thank God)
Gettin' checks, I don't believe her, she say she done with me
Burned some bridges and I let the fire light the way (oh-woah)
