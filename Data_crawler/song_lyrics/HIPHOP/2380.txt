Song Name: MORBID MIND
I can't keep writing songs about the things I left behind
I've spent way too much time alone inside my morbid mind
I wanna live inside my dreams but I can't sleep at night
I lost myself between the seams and I just close my eyes
Don't let me fall, I won't stay too long
I gave my all and I'm always staying strong
I can't go back home 'til my name is known
No, I can't fall, yeah
And I can't keep running from myself by drinking alcohol
I got too drunk last night, I think I almost lost it all
I smoke too much, don't eat enough and barely sleep at all
When I'm alone, can't get away from all my morbid thoughts
Don't let me fall, I won't stay too long
I gave my all and I'm always staying strong
I can't go back home 'til my name is known
No, I can't fall, yeah
I can't keep writing songs about the things I left behind
I've spent way too much time alone inside my morbid mind
I wanna live inside my dreams but I can't sleep at night
I lost myself between the seams and I just close my eyes
Don't let me fall, I won't stay too long
I gave my all, still I'm always staying strong
I can't go back home 'til my name is known
No, I can't fall, yeah
