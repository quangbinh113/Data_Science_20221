Song Name: The Way Life Goes (feat. Oh Wonder)
That's true (that's true)
That's right (that right, that right)
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No, I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello
I was listening to this song
It go like
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (yeah)
You'll find another life to live (yeah)
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give (yeah)
You'll find another life to live (yeah)
I know that you'll get over it (yeah)
Wish I never, ever, ever told you things
I was only, only trying to show you things (yeah)
Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the ring (damn, yeah)
She smiling happy, but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(Broke boy, broke boy, broke boy, broke boy)
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans (yeah)
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (yeah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give (yeah)
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it
See, I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me, then I'ma let her (bye)
Go over there with that broke fella (go over)
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather, ooh
My new chick, I swear that she better, ooh
Want me back, never, ooh (ooh)
That's true (that's true)
That's right (that's right, that right)
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No, I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (but why?)
You'll find another life to live (you'll find)
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (no, no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No, I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
