Song Name: Sleepy Hollow
A-ha-ha, yeah, Mr. Redd
Woah, woah, Big 14 know what the fuck goin' on (shh)
Gang shit, nigga (ha)
Thank you (ha), yeah
Feel like Ichigo, nigga, I'm a hollow (yeah)
Talk down on the gang, you can get some hollows (yeah)
Leave a nigga headless, Sleepy Hollow
Pull up in a Dark Knight Murciélago
And I'm duckin', dodging 12 and the potholes (fuck 12, yeah)
I was raised by the motherfuckin' Glock, woah
Chopper hit him, make a nigga Diddy Bop, woah
Chopper hit him, make a nigga Milly Rock, woah (woo, woo)
(Ha) send a couple shells (shells, blaow)
Send a pussy nigga straight to Hell (yeah)
I got racks (racks), clientele (yeah)
Brodie called, he won't be makin' bail (bail)
Damn, sad news (sad news)
Gettin' tired of the bad news (bad news)
Tragedy (oh, I know you ain't finna do it to 'em, on son, you gonna do it?)
Should I do it to 'em? Bitch, I had to (yeah)
Feel like Ichigo, nigga, I'm a hollow (yeah)
Talk down on the gang, you can get some hollows (yeah)
Leave a nigga headless, Sleepy Hollow
Pull up in a Dark Knight Murciélago
And I'm duckin', dodging 12 and the potholes (fuck 12, yeah)
I was raised by the motherfuckin' Glock, woah
Chopper hit him, make a nigga Diddy Bop, woah
Chopper hit him, make a nigga Milly Rock, woah (woo)
