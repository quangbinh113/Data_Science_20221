Song Name: Gone Till November
Drum Dummie
KimJ with the heat
On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone again
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go 'n' mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing, heart keep breaking
Uh, no matter what I do, can't keep nobody happy
Can't keep these haters off me, can't get along with my daddy
I hope when they get older that my kids can understand me
All I ever wanted with they mama was a family
'Cause all I ever felt growing up was abandoned
Pops went up the river, left a nigga out here stranded
But as I grew wiser, I could finally understand it
It seems since a teen I been on my own planet
Lord knows I love my mama but I hate she think I'm crazy
Then got out here on my own, got in this world and made it
All the shit that we been through, you would think that I hate ya
Still put on my super suit, came back to you and saved us
I was lost as a teen, can't believe that I made it out
Can't believe I got everything that I prayed about
And I knew for a minute what's too good to be true
All the shit I took you through, girl, I apologize to you
On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone (yeah, again)
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go 'n' mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing (yeah, yeah), heart keep breaking (keep breaking)
On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go 'n' mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing, heart keep breaking
