Song Name: thailand
Flew my bitch out from Thailand, yeah, she do the most
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about 12 for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every little team
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money
You know Bird loungin' by the pool
You know Donbo comin' with the woo
I think Keefa just bought some new sneakers
Five-thousand, them bitches brand-new
I was ridin' on the jet' with lil Setty
He my lil' bro, but that nigga heavy
I spent 25 thou' on her titties
They took her ass fat right out her belly
I want some diamonds, I want some baguetties
Eliantte callin' every time I'm ready
Off a couple bars, I don't need a medic
If I did it, then I meant it and I said it
Dwayne Wade, I kept the heat
Say she a squirter, it got wet on the seat
I got a burden like a man in a meet
Feel like I buy another safe every week
Fivio said she a wetty
I was sittin' at the trap house, whippin' shit out the crocker like Betty
All a nigga need 'bout ten racks
He'll pop you if you pop a 30
My lil' nigga do dirty
He just need the lil' wordie
Give a fuck 'bout the verdict
Flew my bitch out from Thailand, yeah, she do the most
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about 12 for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every little team
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money
Ayy, if I got the time, fuck her like a menace
Open up her tonsils like she at the dentist
Writin' checks, had to work on my penmanship
What you got, I spent more on my fit, I spent more on my bitch
20 bitches on top of the Ritz
Got the store, you should cop you some kicks
We gettin' money hooray, hooray, hooray
Havin' dodey on dodey, ain't talkin' no stimulus
We went to war for this shit
When you stackin' up paper on paper on paper
You gon' need some more of this shit
Livin' prototype they gon' copy a nigga
I done spent some Ms on my property, nigga
Got rich off "The Box" how I box me a nigga
Flew my bitch out from Thailand, yeah, she do the most
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about 12 for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every little team
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money
