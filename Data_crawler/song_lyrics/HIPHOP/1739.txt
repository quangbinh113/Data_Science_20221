Song Name: It's Givin
Big Latto (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch)
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch, it's givin')
It's givin' bad bitch (bad bitch)
Never-ever play me like I'm average (like I'm average, uh)
Never bring a nigga over where I lay my head (never)
Lady in the streets, but a freak hoe in the bed (freak)
Don't make me say it twice, bitch, I said what I said (the fuck?)
Two things I don't need, that's a nigga or his bread (oh God)
Sip me like some Hi-C, 'cause you know I got the juice
She stay on her grind and she pull up in that new (skrrt)
Work a nine-to-five and she tryna finish school (yeah)
I bring the table to the table, nigga, why would I need you? (The fuck?)
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch, what? What?)
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch)
It's givin' bad bitch (bad bitch)
Never-ever play me like I'm average (like I'm average, the fuck?)
It's givin' rich bitch (rich bitch)
It's givin' rich bitch (rich bitch, it's givin')
It's givin' bad bitch (bad bitch)
Never-ever play me like I'm average (like I'm average)
It's givin' broke (ew)
You want a young bitch with ambition? Play your role (play your role)
It's givin' Coke (ooh)
Bottle body, wanna hit it like some dope
I'm in that wham-bam, brand new Lamb'
Pull up, hop out, shut it down
Sloppy-toppy, call him papi when he make that slurping sound
It's givin' cake by the pound (oh)
It's givin' trips out of town (oh)
Pussy water, he gon' sink or swim, I might just let him drown
Bottega heels in the club (yeah, yeah)
Bottega heels in the club (ayy)
Who ever thought that a bitch'd be up?
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch, what? What?)
It's givin' boss bitch (boss bitch)
It's givin' bad bitch (bad bitch)
Never-ever play me like I'm average (like I'm average, the fuck?)
It's givin' rich bitch (rich bitch)
It's givin' rich bitch (rich bitch, it's givin')
It's givin' bad bitch (bad bitch)
Never-ever play me like I'm average (like I'm average)
It's givin' big Birkin
Close the curtain in the Rolls Royce, that's what it's givin' me, bitch
I don't know what it's givin' y'all, y'all hoes givin' broke
Busted and disgustin' (it's givin' boss bitch)
Lamb' chop' truck, what it cost, bitch?
Santana, everything motherfuckin' big
No small time, no small toys, no broke boys (no broke boys)
Big Latto
