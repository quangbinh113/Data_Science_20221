Song Name: Everybody Dies In Their Nightmares
Ooh, ah-ah-ah
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the nighttime
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, gettin' caught in traffic
(Don't go to sleep)
(Don't go, stay up and)
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the nighttime
Don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't
Ooh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and
