Song Name: Big Steppa
Whole fit dipped in Margiela
Nigga, this pussy got levels, bitch, I'm pressure
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
Yo' bitch can't do better
Watch me, it just upset her, bitch, could never
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, uh, big, big stepper, big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, big, big stepper, big stepper
Real boss bitch, don't give a fuck
Wanna keep your nigga? Learn how to suck
Came in a Lamb', left in a truck
Bitch, I'm a combo, titties and a butt
You got that regular, my shit deluxe
I came with extra, you just a dub
You came to talk, I came to fuck
You came for dick, I came for bucks
Good in any hood, I can go to the Westside
Matter fact I can go to the Eastside
Matter fact you can catch me on the Southside
Everybody know me, bitch, I'm worldwide
Whole fit dipped in Margiela
Nigga, this pussy got levels, bitch, I'm pressure
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
Yo' bitch can't do better
Watch me, it just upset her, bitch, could never
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, uh, big, big stepper, big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, big, big stepper, big stepper
I'm a big stepper (uh)
He my lil' playboy, call him Hugh Hefner (bunny)
When I come through, don't touch, be careful (don't touch)
Gotta make him work for it 'cause it's too special
Body on ten, you lose, I win (haha)
Nigga said, "Fuck me," I was like, "When?"
Did it by myself, I ain't never need a friend
I'm right now, you was poppin' back then (uh)
Anyways, I'm good in any hood, I can go to the Westside
Matter fact I can go to the Eastside
Matter fact you can catch me on the Southside
Everybody know me, bitch, I'm worldwide (know me)
Whole fit dipped in Margiela
Nigga, this pussy got levels, bitch, I'm pressure
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
Yo' bitch can't do better
Watch me, it just upset her, bitch, could never
Christians on, dancin' with the devil
Red hot lips, no pepper, I'm a big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, uh, big, big stepper, big stepper
I'm a big, big stepper, big, big stepper, big stepper
