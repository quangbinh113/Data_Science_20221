Song Name: Count on Me (Intro)
I look great on the surface, but I'm not doing well (not doing well)
Get to where I'm going, I put myself through hell
Not the happiest person, but nobody can tell
'Cause I never cry for help, I'd rather cry by myself (yeah)
Can't let what someone say about me make me now (oh)
Thought I did this shit correctly, but still, they don't respect me
I wonder why they hate me now (hate me now)
Why don't they accept me?
They just keep on rejecting me and it's starting to break me down
When my problems get the best of me, forget about my blessings
I don't care if they take me now
I ain't scared to die, I'm scared to live too long
Don't wanna find which friend is gonna stab me in my back
Don't wanna find out who my ex wit' when she moves on
Don't wanna find out when I'm working, I'm tryna relax
I don't wanna know when I'm falling off
I don't wanna know who not gon' take my calls
I know I'll only be around for so long (so long)
But when they count me out, who can I count on?
Me, I got me (I got me)
Count on me, I can count on me
I can count on me
I got me, I got me
Count on me, I can count on me
I can count on me
