Song Name: private island
Wheezy Outta Here
I'm just kickin' it with a baddie, smokin' on exotic (Yes)
Ain't it ironic, look at me now, I used to sell narcotics (Yes)
Couldn't sell it whole, had to break it down, but now it's all profit (All profit)
They don't like advice, but I know this life just ain't for everybody
I done heard too many times you can't get rich with no knowledge (No knowledge)
Told the shawty if she mine, then promise me you keep it solid (Keep it solid)
You know bitches talk, but you with a boss, so we keep our business private (Business private)
He ain't nevеr fucked you on a private island
I fly G5, I don't know the sky milеage (Sky mileage)
I got some slimes out a beehive, I know they dying 'bout it (Dying 'bout it)
CIP Troup, I'm holding it down, You on my mind, Charlie (On my mind, Charlie)
I got on all white Chanel, I feel godly (Feel godly)
Every one of my cribs spotless (Cribs spotless)
Oh, we made a way, oh, made a way
I knew we would see better days
I knew we would see better days
Oh, made a way
Why they facial expression givin' hate?
Why they act like I ain't helping 'em out, 'cause they energy fake
Must've think I ain't have nothing to say
My first deal was 1.5, there wasn't nothing left to say
The thanks I get feel like high-five, I know I changed the wave
When I'm outside, the sun gon' shine, ain't no more rainy days
She love my vibe, I love her vibe, I mean what can I say?
And count it when you pray, Thank God for these better days
Oh, we made a way, oh, made a way
I knew we would see better days
I knew we would see better days
Oh, made a way
I'm just kickin' it with a baddie smoking on exotic (Yes)
Ain't it ironic, look at me now, I used to sell narcotics (Yes)
Couldn't sell it whole, had to break it down, but now it's all profit (All profit)
They don't like advice, but I know this life just ain't for everybody
I done heard too many times you can't get rich with no knowledge (No knowledge)
Told the shawty if she mine, then promise me you keep it solid (Keep it solid)
You know bitches talk, but you with a boss, so we keep our business private (Business private)
He ain't nevеr fucked you on a private island
