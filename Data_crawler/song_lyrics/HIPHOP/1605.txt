Song Name: Crossfaded
It ain't that much to do out here, I see you, I see you
I get a little bit crossfaded, catch your fire, oh
Sometimes you're toxic (toxic)
I'm through it, now see (now see)
And whatever you call this, yeah
But I've known you for a long time (long time)
Put you on your own grind (yeah, yeah)
Need you on my own line
Starin' at the sunrise
It be hella hard to cut ties
Me and baby start an enterprise
Speed it in that SV (woah-oh)
Leg room on sight, ain't gotta touch the key (yeah)
When you know you need help, ain't gotta ask me (ask me)
Ain't got your own back and yes, I'm happy
Oh, yes, I'm happy (oh)
I wanna feel the juice at the car lot
Gimme head at the light when the car stop (car stop)
In the Range, in the Jeep, in the droptop (droptop)
Hold me down, gotta watch for the cops
My block (yeah), my block
You know what you're doin' on my block
Tried to sit you down, this a time out
Guess that really showed you what I'm about (what I'm about)
It ain't that much to do out here, I see you, I see you
I get a little bit crossfaded, catch your fire, oh
Sometimes you're toxic (toxic)
I'm through it, now see (now see)
And whatever you call this, yeah
Are we down for each other?
Are you down for another?
Are we down for each other?
Are you down? Are you down?
'Cause I'm down for you
Down for each other
Down for each other
Are you down for another?
'Cause I'm down for you
Down for each other
