Song Name: Baguettes in the Face (feat. NAV, Playboi Carti & A Boogie Wit da Hoodie)
Mustard on the beat, hoe
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take (Take)
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face (Bling)
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made (Made)
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Lots of bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack (Wack)
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
Have you ever been with a boss?
I know your boyfriend took you shopping at Ross
I'm always drippin', I leave puddles when I walk (Drip)
If she don't know how to dress, I wanna talk (No cap)
But I might still get some top
I don't need her but my pocket full of knots
Number one, there's finally real ones at the top (At the top)
I'm with Mustard and we talkin' Lambo' talk (Skrrt, skrrt)
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take (Take)
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face (Bling)
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made (Made)
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwin' ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Lots of bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack (Wack)
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
I just pulled up, I got some new shit (I just)
I just pulled up, I got a new bitch (Carti, yeah)
My bitch, she bad, I bought her bracelet (Blatt)
Iced up, yeah, on my necklace (On my necklace, yeah)
I pull up and slay shit (Yeah, ice, yeah)
I pull up and break shit (I just pull up on 'em)
I just told my mom, "Thank God I made it" (I just told my mom)
We got money over here, we startin' to pay, bitch (Startin' to pay)
I got old school, yeah, in the backyard (Back)
In the black car (Uh)
I'm a black boy (Yeah)
What's your neck boy? Huh
Check this neck, boy (Slatt)
Got these black diamonds (Yeah)
On baguettes, boy (Black)
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take (Take)
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face (Bling)
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made (Made)
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwin' ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Lots of bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack (Wack)
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
Huh, me and your bitch up in the Phantom
If you want her back you better man up
I know you just don't understand her
She just want you to help her get her bands up
Oh nah, nah, nah, ay
Just ride my wave like a tsunami
I came from the jungle, from a safari
I don't want no Nicki, I want a ménage à
Don't give me no hickies, baby give me sloppy
I already seen you naked, girl I know your body
You like fucking with the lights off, on some shy shit
You gon' end up being famous if you talk about it
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take (Take)
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face (Bling)
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made (Made)
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Lots of bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack (Wack)
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
