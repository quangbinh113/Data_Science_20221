Song Name: Stay Awake
(Ayy, Woods, light that shit up)
Shawty fuck with my demeanor, yeah, I got strips like Adidas
Shawty like that I'm icy, this a Cartier, not a Viva (Yeah)

Like, do they look at me like bait the way these niggas be biting, yeah? (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, just stay awake (Stay awake)
What you stay loyal to? Just stay awake (Stay awake)
'Cause I'm so out of love, it's hard for me (For me)
Keep me a knot, keep me some guap
Lately, can't stop (Yeah), yeah
Always on top, how could I drop?
How could I flop? (Yeah), yeah
You got one shot, you better give this shit all that you got, uh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
And I promise I won't be a choice to that young nigga rot, ayy, yeah
What's in your drank?
What's in your bank?
Racks in your face (Face), yeah
I got a lot of shit on my mind, I cannot think (I can't, yeah)
I wanna evolve, I wanna enter a whole new rank (Rank, yeah)
I'm 'bout peel off, all of you niggas, I'm 'bout to go crazy (Skrrt)
And I'ma pull up with my feelings, in that Hellcat like a reaper (Yeah)
And I know shawty is an L, hell, yeah, shawty really is a eater (Yeah)

Yeah, I'm so out of love, it's not for me
Yeah, I'm so out of touch, just stay away (Wow, wow)
I'm too gone, I can't feel your touch no more (No)
Call my phone, then I leave you on dial tone, and (Brr, hello?)
I'm just losing all my touch, my credibility is lust
I don't know if this relationship was built off trust (I don't know)
And I know (And I know)
I can turn you right into the best you (The best you)
Nowadays can't fit you in my schedule (Schedule)
I don't even pray, but I can bless you (Bless you)
No, I'm not the type that's just gon' check you (Check, uh-uh)
But I got that bread, let's see what that check do (Check do)
And I got that Wraith
And if you mess up, then I'm gon' let you (Let you)
Went out sad one time, can't go out bad (No)
No, I come in first, can't come in last (No)
Poppin' tags, Balenci' on my ass
