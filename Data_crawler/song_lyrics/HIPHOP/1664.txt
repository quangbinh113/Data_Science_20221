Song Name: If I Want You
Sliding down Doheney, staying lowkey
Didn't know you was in town, you should've told me
We was talkin' everyday without a cold feet
You hate me how I am, you miss the old me
Been in and out the city makin' plays
So busy losing track of time and mixing up my days
I call you when I'm lonely, I come over never stay
You sellin' me intention, but I'm cheap I never pay
(You know what it) is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between
If I want you, yeah
80 degrees in the fall
Still your heart froze
You so outta reach
Now you doing the most
You know what it is bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ey-yeah
Still haven't found one girl that I need
I wanna take it slow but all she wanna do is speed
She want a follow back, I told her no, I like to lead
I'm touchin you in person, I don't need you on my feed
Childish, you're so childish
I like wild shit, I like hot girls
I don't want no mild shit
From the highlight room to my houses
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah (if I want you)
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between
If I want you, yeah (if I want you)
80 degrees in the fall
Still your heart froze
You so outta reach
Now you doing the most
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ey-yeah
(Yeah) long nights all alone I've been drowning in the smoke
Took a 30 way too strong
I can't feel my face no more
I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want
(Yeah) long nights all alone I've been drowning in the smoke
Took a 30 way too strong
I can't feel my face no more
I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between
If I want you, yeah
80 degrees in the fall
Still your heart froze
You so outta reach (reach)
Now you doing the most (most)
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ey-yeah
