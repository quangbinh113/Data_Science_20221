Or maybe that's just my city

I was playin' with poles (crazy man)
Countin' up bankrolls (phew)
Pourin' a lot of fours
Yeah, started rappin' and made a career (ayy)
Ran up more cake every year (ayy, ayy)
Nothin' but expansion, ayy
Bought me some cars, I bought me some mansions, ayy
With no advances, ayy
Private island, it used to be stranded, ayy
I be with bandits
Run in your spot like that bitch abandoned
Opps'll get frantic
My head hot, I keep me a Glock and I ain't gon' panic, bitch (crazy man)
Yeah, run that kick door (crazy, man), run that kick door (boom)

Dre, hey, this is Mom, where are you?
Shit, I'm tired, I've been callin' your phone all day
You hadn't answered and I don't know where you are
But you need to get your ass home
And please don't bring your friends over here
I ain't got time for that shit today, okay?
