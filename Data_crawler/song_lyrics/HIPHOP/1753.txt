Matching Cartier with baguettes, that's a bet (bet)
Bought the new crib for the tax, not to flex (flex)
I don't need his money but I'll take it to invest (yeah)
Want a bad bitch? Gotta say it with your chest (ha, ha, ha)
Talk to me nicely
I just spent a quarter-million dollars on a ice piece (ice)
I just turned a eight-figure nigga to a hypebeast (tough)
"Rubi a hoe," that's cap, bitch, I'm wifey
Second thought, bitch, I might be
Turn a nigga life to a movie like I'm Spike Lee
I ain't tryna hear none of that (none of that)
If he tell me "No" again, I ain't comin' back (bitch)
Jacque Marie on my face, it's like run to that (ayy)
Whole squad in this bitch, I'm the running back (yeah)
Hut one, hut two, hut three
I just touched down (yeah) with a hunnid on me
Watch me work, woah, yeah (work, work, work)
Watch me work (work, work, work)
Watch me work, yeah (work, work, work)
Watch me work (work), watch me work (work)
Watch me work that (work)
Watch me turn around and twerk that
Hurt bae, he ain't gon' never get this work back
Persian rugs all through the crib like I'm PND (yeah)
I don't do the back and forth, I'm on DND
Hol' up (bitch)
Penthouse finna go up
Baby off that 1942 'til she throw up (ayy, ayy, ayy)
It's so crazy (so motherfuckin' crazy)
I could trade that AP for that new Mercedes
I could hit you with the, "Ah, wait, let me stop" (stop)
I know how bitches move, y'all might call the cops (twelve)
Two-tone my Chanel with the matchin' rocks (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Rap bitches in the dirt, y'all can match the opps
It's up (yeah)
Yeah, bitch, it's up (it's up)
Still thick as fuck (fuck)
Still don't give a fuck (bitch)
Baby got that choppa on her, she be in the cut
Brrr-grrah (that's tough)
Watch me work, yeah (work, work, work)
Watch me work (work, work, work)
Watch me work, on the gang, yeah (work, work, work)
Watch me work (work), watch me work (work)
Watch me work that (work)
Watch me turn around and twerk that
Hurt bae, he ain't gon' never get this work back
Persian rugs all through the crib like I'm PND (yeah)
