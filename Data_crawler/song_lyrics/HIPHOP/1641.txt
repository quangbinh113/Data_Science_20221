Song Name: B.R.O. (Better Ride Out) [feat. Roddy Ricch]
Said, I ain't got no friends, all my niggas blood to me
Spillin' in your ear, yeah, that's blood money
Hey, you niggas fuckin' up my vibe (yeah)
I'm gettin' money, yeah, I'm fine
If I call you bro', you better ride out
Just tell me what's the word and we gon' slide on guys
Me and broski poppin' .30s, no sleep
Don't approach me if you ain't got no love for me
I ain't got no friends, all my niggas like blood to me
Treat my whole gang just like blood brothers
If I call you my brother, then we gon' ride
I love you forever, nigga, my guy for life
You know it's whatever if you fight, I fight
Tell mе what's the word and we gon' slide on guys
Mе and broski sippin' on Codeine
Don't approach if you ain't got no love for me
I ain't got no friends, all my niggas like blood to me
I'm DTB forever, bitches know me (know me, bitches know)
700 thousand, a Phantom on a random
Buy the bitch a Birkin every time she throw a tantrum
My accountant on speed dial, I told him, "Make the transfer"
Ain't got questions on 'cause I walk with all the answers
I pull up million dollar car (blu, blu, blu)
I know some Bloods that are slime (woo, woo, woo)
Blueberry seats, perfect time (woo, woo, woo)
The projects always showin' love for me, yeah
Whenever I'm in New York, me and Boogie like cousins
Gotta fire up a jet and take a trip out to London (woo)
My diamonds always hittin' me, in Eliantte always up to somethin'
Diamonds on baguettes, girl, just tell me if I'm heavy
I came from the bottom, I came straight out of poverty
I had to look around to see who's with me and not with me
Tryna go and stack these billions on the long road
If I tell you, "I love you", that ain't a lie
Until I make a couple million, I can't go home
They want a championship, so I bought the two-tone (woo)
Bentley color, see 'em ridin' with the roof gone
Killed my vibe
I'm gettin' money, yeah, I'm fine
If I call you bro', you better ride out
Just tell me what's the word and we gon' slide, slide, slide
Just me and broski sippin' on this codeine
Don't approach if you ain't got no love for me
I ain't got no friends, all my niggas like blood to me
Treat my whole gang just like blood brothers
If I call you my brother, then we gon' ride
I love you forever, nigga, my guy for life
You know it's whatever if you fight, I fight
Tell me what's the word and we gon' slide on guys
Just me and my broski, poppin' thirties, no sleep
Don't approach if you ain't got no love for me
I ain't got no friends, all my niggas like blood to me
Whole damn gang, treat 'em like blood brothers
