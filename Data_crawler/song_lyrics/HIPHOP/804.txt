Song Name: Finesse Out The Gang Way (feat. Lil Baby)
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
I came from nothin', I had to go get it
I had to finesse out the gang way (gang way)
I done did everything for the niggas that I love
Who stuck in the chain gang (chain gang)
Shit be so weird I'm steady watchin' all the niggas
Who yellin' out, "Gang, gang" (gang, gang)
Shit be so different, I'm watchin' the niggas who bitches
But yellin' out, "Bang, bang" (bang, bang)
Roll up a blunt on that Pluto
Used to be deep now I'm riding 'round uno
I know some niggas who hustlin' but quit
'Cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers
But now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much to me it felt you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out the side of my granny crib, I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewellers, "Don't know where the Patek is"
Now it's two-tone
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought that I'd win? (Win, oh)
Asked 'em why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30, like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas bein' goofy
Spendin' their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail, ride around with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' with hunnids
Gucci bag, double fifty, one hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call a dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (got me in my feelings)
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought that I'd win? (Win, oh)
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought that I'd win? (Win, oh)
Man I've been trappin' since 2007
My momma was strugglin', I had to help
From juvenile to the penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy to say I got it together
53 percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a ganster I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like business
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bowls to my brother them
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama we need a bigger house
I'm too real for this shit, I done figured out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (out)
I ran it up to a low from an ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought
I ran it up in this motherfucker
300 shots, that's enough in this motherfucker
Only The Family, it's us in this motherfucker, gang shit
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought that I'd win? (Win, oh)
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought that I'd win? (Win, oh)
