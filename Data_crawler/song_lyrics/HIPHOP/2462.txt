Song Name: Stressed
I must be lost in my regrets
I must be down
I must be stressed
I've got like 13 years of age
That I ain't still got off my chest
It must be so much more to life
If I had diamonds and baguettes
I must be stupid, fucking shaded
Must be down
I must be stressed
I must be cooler than glaciers
I'm straight as the lines on my paper
I must be out of my nature
Put that on my Lord and my Savior
I must be ready for more, ready to go, universe spoke
I must be
I know
You don't really want no parts in it
Only do shit if my heart's in it
These days feelings on shortages
And I only show love to my pharmacist
Darling, I've been shady, feelings fading
I've been lackadaisy
So far, so frustrating
I've been snortin lines like it's the 80's, please
I must be lost in my regrets
I must be down
I must be stressed
I've got like 13 years of age
That I ain't still got off my chest
It must be so much more to life
If I had diamonds and baguettes
I must be stupid, fucking shaded
Must be down
I must be stressed
I must be
(And I don't forget, bitch ass nigga)
(We coming for you)
(Bitch ass nigga)
Sabotaging me till I'm forced to rip the mask off
This lobotomy is just a reflection of the last lost
This body is in remembrance of the last lost
And this lady is too pretentious of the mascot
Look got a 22
I wouldn't call this bitch a catch-22
But here is your body back that I can dig for you
Let me live for you, let me crawl inside your body
Make a meal of you
And tell you how many times I ain't feelin you, bitch
I must be lost in my regrets
I must be down
I must be stressed
I've got like 13 years of age
That I ain't still got off my chest
It must be so much more to life
If I had diamonds and baguettes
I must be stupid, fucking shaded
Must be down
I must be stressed
I must be lost in my regrets
I must be down
I must be stressed
I've got like 13 years of age
That I ain't still got off my chest
It must be so much more to life
If I had diamonds and baguettes
I must be stupid, fucking shaded
Must be down
I must be stressed
I must be (Yeah yeah yeah)
I got my champagne
I, I got on Vetements right now
And I'm still stressed
Even, even in, even in my Balenciagas
I see you in the back
