Song Name: Lalala
Did I really just forget that melody?
Nah, da da dadadada nananana
Alright, da da dadadada
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold he from the North, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
How I stride like that?
Amex, no cap, 800 score
They wonder how, how I guap like that
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how, how I stride like that
Married to the grind, I bought my ring
I'm corny, but your girlie want that dick
Modest with my jewels but check the bank
Finally got that money, say my thanks
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold he from the North, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
How I stride like that?
Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how, how I guap like that
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how, I stride like that
Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy Loosey Goosey, sussy boy I keep your cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you call a fool
Ay, ha, ay
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold he from the North, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist it go like chachacha, chachacha
I got your bitch singing lalalala, lalala
How I stride like that?
