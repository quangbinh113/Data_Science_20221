Song Name: Holy Smokes
Yeah, yeah
Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up
Multi millions, I fill a hundred up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up
See a bag for this shit like a acrobat, nigga, get your stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup
All this cash on me, but this money still won't buy love
You can't fit my racks in an arena
White cup filled with purple stuff, it look like Frieza
Bro and them got hit with that subpoena
Better keep they mouth shut or we're gonna have to clean up
Throwin' money up like I'm nauseous
Baby girl, I'm exhausted
Baby, be cautious
Know the streets be talkin'
Every day, walk with a check and a motherfuckin' target
Every day, makin' money every way, hang with them bosses
Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up
Multi millions, I fill a hundred up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up
See a bag for this shit like a acrobat, nigga, get your stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup
All this cash on me, but this money still won't buy love
All this damn dick fillin' her tummy up (yeah)
I done fucked your bitch and her best friend in front of her
How the fuck you ain't never get your money up?
I just spent me a hundred thousand, I treat it like it's 20 bucks
I'm a Leo, now watch how I fuck the summer up
Your girl got my name tatted, she swear she won't get a cover up
If he want smoke with me, that's another blunt
All different kinds
Every girl fine
Can't make my mind
Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up
Multi millions, I fill a hundred up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up
See a bag for this shit like a acrobat, nigga, get your stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup
All this cash on me, but this money still won't buy love

(What? Yeah)
(Where am I?)
(14, 16)
(Huh? Huh?)
(Really, where am I?)
