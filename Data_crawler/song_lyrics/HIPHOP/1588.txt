She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been? (Yeah, yeah)
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank (ooh, no, no, no-uh)
Don't hold no rank
Yeah, uh
Dirty ass, Maryland ass nigga with a sick ass mouth and a slick ass flow, uh
Got your bitch around me, nigga, ain't no playin'
When I'm comin' for the kitty, I'm a fool, goddamn
Do it for my niggas in the coast right there
Do it for my niggas in the ghost right now
Niggas got killed for the boy live his dreams in the hills
And they watchin' for the boy right now
Goddamn, what a time, what a year, uh
We are what them young boys fear, uh
I kill, never been killed, that's real, no lie
You can tell that from our peers right now
Bet you wanna fuck me now, uh
Bet you wanna love me down, uh
Girl, you can't tie me down like Ray J said
But know I'm down, uh
Freaky deaky show me something, uh
Shake it like you owe me something, uh
Pushin' on the pussy like a button
Came four times, fifth time you gushin', uh
Still gettin' rowdy in the function, uh
Bitches on my dick like it's nothing, uh
Everywhere I go now, always got shit bumpin', jumpin', bumpin', jumpin', yeah
Hey, nice to meet, I'm Young Jefe, who you be?
Got a piece in Southeast, got her clappin' to this beat
She invite me to her crib, I walk in she see my heat
She said "But I live in the hills" bitch, that's just the way I sleep
Stop that madness, I'm a savage
In traffic with MAC 11's
Baddest bitch and she Spanish
I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy
She know a nigga ain't average
Ain't nothing wrong with fake asses
Bitch, turn around, let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh huh, I'm on it
Don't look at me like you want it
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin'
In fourth down we ain't puntin' it
King of District of Columbia
Can't come here without a permit
This shit really a jungle, gorillas and anacondas
She see money all around me (hey, hey, hey)
I look like I'm the man, yeah (Young Jefe Holmes)
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been? (Yeah, yeah)
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank (ooh, no, no, no-oh)
Don't hold no rank
