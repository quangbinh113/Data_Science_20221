Song Name: Thug Life
Come and take a walk in my shoes if you can
Pro'lly won't stand a chance
I'm from the bottom, it turn boys into men
Up before the sunrise catch me if you can
You know I'm with the gang, wrong or right, yeah
Willing to pay with my life so
If I don't make it home tonight
Bury me a gangsta, he's just a thug like me
He's just a thug like me
He's just a thug like me
He's just a thug like his baby
The bottom made me crazy
Daddy gone and momma couldn't save me
So hard times made me
I done spinned the block in my Mercedes
Reminiscing on the times we didn't have shit
Even when was I broke I knew that
I wasn't average, mixed with passion
Ain't no recipe, this thug life was shit
Might be the death of me
And I say that selfishly
Because I'm grown now, kids of my own now
Momma hold on now your baby boy strong now
Money getting long now
Gotta a reason to live
They don't know the route
That we took to get here
Cause where I come from
They ain't ahasing a dream
Where I come from
It Ain't Safe To Believe
Where I come from it's a race to 18
They jump straight off the porch
And land straight in the streets, Goddamn
Heard you keep the glizzy
In your pants, Goddamn
I heard you have Ppans
To Be The Man Goddamn
I won't let a nigga' get a chance
Thug life bitch until the end
Come and take a walk in my shoes if you can
Pro'lly won't stand a chance
I'm from the Bottom it turn boys into men
Up before the sunrise catch me if you can
You know I'm with the gang, wrong or right
Willing to pay with my life so
If I don't make it home tonight
Bury me a gangsta
He's a thug like me, is he?
He's just a thug like me
He's just a thug like me, babe oh
