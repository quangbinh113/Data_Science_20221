Song Name: Take My Soul (feat. YoungBoy Never Broke Again)
On my mama, I ain't never gonna let them take my soul
Gotta cherish the ones you love, never know who's next to go
I'm screaming free all of my dawgs, they got 'em up the road
And I'm just thinking about the times when I was fucking broke
Thinking about the times I was going crazy (Going crazy)
Me and my baby moms just had our first baby (First baby)
We ain't had shit, I used to be mad all day (Mad all day)
Had to hit licks just to get some cash on deck (Cash on deck)
Living a life of sin
Like I got God's permission
I'd rather be dead in Hell before I do life in prison
Huh, they come from the blindside when you least expect it, huh
It be your own bloodline tryna take your necklace, huh
Never trust these bitches, they'll line you up quick
I done fell in love with this ho, she was plotting on me
And I can't even lie, she had the drop on me
But I'm too slick and she was moving stupid
On my mama, I ain't never gonna let them take my soul
Gotta cherish the ones you love, never know who's next to go
I'm screaming free all of my dawgs, they got 'em up the road
And I'm just thinking about the times when I was fucking broke
And I'm just thinking about the times I ain't have no fucking hope
I was down, I was out, I was all alone
My brother died in these streets, wish I could call his phone
Will you make it out the hood? You never know
Judge made me move back to those slums (Uh, uh, uh)
Post on the block all day with guns (Like we waitin' on somethin')
'Round plenty hitters, me and my son
Anything happen, we gon' run
BaBa in the cut, hit a nigga up, 'fore they pull off, leave him slumped
Murder, that's a must, kill him, get a rush, all of the money I done sunk
It was all love, even for the love, half of 'em wouldn't even hunt
We don't give a fuck, get his head bust 'fore I let him take one of us
We'll never break, word to my name, same niggas gang who I trust
B-Dawg, that's my mans, he up in chains, everything fucked up
They took one brother out my gang, how the fuck these niggas lucked up?
Still hurt, my body full of pain, and we killed three-four them
Thinking 'bout it like I'm insane, put you to sleep, you a temp
On my mama, I ain't never gonna let them take my soul
Gotta cherish the ones you love, never know who's next to go
I'm screaming free all of my dawgs, they got 'em up the road
And I'm just thinking about the times when I was fucking broke
And I'm just thinking about the times I ain't have no fucking hope
I was down, I was out, I was all alone
My brother died in these streets, wish I could call his phone
Will you make it out the hood? You never know
Will you make it out the hood? You never know
