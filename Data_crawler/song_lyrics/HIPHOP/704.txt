Song Name: Gang WithMe
And every time I pop out, bitch, you know I got the gang with me
Them them niggas that's gon' bang for me
Homicide, homicide, they gon' make them bullets rain for me
It ain't no cure for all this pain in me
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Can't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Can't let my heart turn cold
Bitch, I'm say "Less gang, I just ride and let my cash speak" (cash)
Same niggas like to run they mouth, have some fast feet (ha, ha)
Nigga, back when bro'nem was alive, you got your ass beat
Gon' reunite with my brothers
They need to let the guys free (guys free)
Blicked up in high speed, ready when we ride deep
Stand over that bitch and shoot his face, watch his mind leak (oh, oh)
Right back on the strip, if it's niggas tryna find me
Nigga, I'm like crack, a fucked up life come with tryin' me
I'm crazy, yeah, they call me Capalot, please don't mind me (ha, ha)
If I get on some bullshit, you know Hyde 'nem right behind me (gang)
I know you heard 'bout Chiraq, I'm from where all the crimes be
I need at least 'bout four M's, that's if you wanna sign me (blast)
Bitch, I'm somethin' great, I keep a mirror to remind me (to remind me)
Gotta wait your turn nigga, you know how that line be
Stay down 'til you come up, nigga, you know how that grind be
Then e'rybody gon' peep you, nigga, you know how that shine be
And every time I pop out, bitch, you know I got the gang with me
Them them niggas that's gon' bang for me
Homicide, homicide, they gon' make them bullets rain for me
It ain't no cure for all this pain in me
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Can't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Can't let my heart turn cold
Ayy, keep your eyes up, them niggas ridin' 'cause we killed they homie
Hope that Glock up on my side the day they drop that window on me
Nigga fuck a friend, run up them bands when I'm feelin' lonely
I stay motivated, too many people dependent on me
I'm high off so many drugs, got me losin' consciousness
Playin' with some murderers
Death gon' be the consequence (grrrt, pop, pop)
FN finish nigga, ain't none of that playin' possum shit
Blood fallin' down his jaws, he gaspin' for oxygen (ha)
They keep slappin' his face, tryna get him to respond and shit
And we ain't movin' sloppy, so them killers left anonymous (bitch)
But niggas quick to tell and put some statements on them documents
Feel like I'm untouchable, ain't cocky, I'm just confident (blast)
Bitches thirsty on me, all the eaters give me compliments
Got it out the mud, they want me for my accomplishments
Ayy, ayy, I just fucked this bitch, and it was just they anniversary
In between that pussy like that bitch was givin' birth to me (ugh)
Left me in the shadows, now they claim they know me personally
They invite us to mansions now, we used to do them burglary
You on some broke shit, I ain't with it, that won't work for me
My price is in the thousands just in case you want a verse from me
And every time I pop out, bitch, you know I got the gang with me
Them them niggas that's gon' bang for me
Homicide, homicide, they gon' make them bullets rain for me
It ain't no cure for all this pain in me
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Can't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy, oh, many men
Many-many-many-many men
Wish death 'pon me
