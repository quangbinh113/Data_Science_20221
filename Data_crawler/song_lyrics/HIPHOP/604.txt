Ah, shit, I'm just workin' in the studio
Ah, okay
You miss me?
Papa
Callin' me "Papa"?
I want you, Papa
Aight, I'll call you right back
You always talkin' about it
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option, yeah
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, oh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
The double C's all on my feet
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
I changed my color to Nipsey blue
Your racks, it get smaller, shit pitiful
If you tryna get so physical
That .45 will make you invisible
I'm livin' my life like a criminal
I call this shit First 48
I been quiet, there's no one to blame, yeah
My lawyer said we beat the case
I'm livin' my life, celebration
I'm thankin' the Lord, I got patience
I'm lovin' the way that she take it
I bend it, I fold it, I flip it
She bringin' it back just to prove it
I'm givin' her work just to move it, yeah
I'm livin' the life that I'm choosin', yeah
I'm gettin' these racks, gettin' stupid, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option, yeah
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, oh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
The double C's all on my feet
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
Pull up with the drum like I'm Tommy Lee
Yaweh got a stick, came to rock with me
Milli' on wrist, ain't no rocks on me
I'm pretty as fuck, wanna copy me (damn)
I heard you was mad 'cause I'm poppin' as shit (wow)
I'm poppin' the 'pagne and I'm poppin' that bitch (wow)
I hop out a plane and went straight to the whip
I know they can see, I think that's pretty cool if you askin' me
Bugatti, no body roll, curtains in back of the candy Rolls
I love when my lawyer calls, I hate when I run out of smoke
Pull up to the party, oh, and we like to party, oh
I finish the bottle, dawg, get this bitch jumpin', no Mario
Still shit's so hard
Cigarettes, cough
Bathroom stalls
Please don't save my life, oh
You always talkin' about it
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, oh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
The double C's all on my feet (one, two, three, four)
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
Like a rockstar
