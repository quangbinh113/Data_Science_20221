Song Name: Pressurelicious (feat. Future)
(Hitkidd, what it do, man?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spend that shit, I'm worth it (hmm), thick, look better in person (mmm)
Hair, nails, match my Birkin (yeah), I don't block hoes, keep lurking, ah
Real Hot Girl Shit (yeah, yeah)
This pussy bomb (yeah), explosive (baow)
It's soaking (ah), osmosis (mwah)
I'm stomping on hoes so motherfucking hard, I'm knocking out Mario tokens (baow, baow, baow)
Your bitch, she regular (yeah), I'm hot, be careful (ha, tss, ha)
She average (yeah), I'm pressure, yeah (I'm pressure)
I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah (mwah)
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave her
Take a picture of my bag, now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass, now your nigga pressed to hit it, pressurelicious
If it's worth it, I'm booking a jet, if it's worth it, I'm spending a check
I done broke out a sweat tryna put the whole thing in your chest
When we fucking, we making a mess, yes
Back stroke, left stroke, deep stroke, your throat
Slow stroke, shawty know that's a go
Ayy, he know I'm really square business, I pull up, the AMG tinted
Working him out, he sweating like it's been hours, it only been a few minutes
He say he toxic, I said, "Okay, well, I'm poison," spit in my mouth, I enjoy it
Talk my shit, I'ma pull a him on him, don't play, I am not one of them (ah)
I'm pressurelicious, yeah (mwah)
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave her (yeah)
Take a picture of my bag, now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass, now your nigga pressed to hit it, pressurelicious
Between my pussy and this drip, you might wanna watch out, nigga, don't slip (nigga, don't slip)
I'm talking 'bout tight, I'm talking 'bout grip (hey, hey)
I'm stacking up more than the Blood and the Crip (blood and the Crip)
Niggas admire the way that I'm built, might let him spank it and give me a whip
I ain't doing nothin' extra, this is strictly for my pleasure, ah
I'm putting it down on an Adderall, went for two hours on Adderall
Went for three hours on Adderall, hit it, four hours on Adderall
Piping you down on an Adderall, piping it up on an Adderall
Knocking you off on an Adderall, pussy so good, I eat it
Five in the morning, I need it, knocking the bed off the hinges
Get in your mouth like a dentist, really, I belong in the Guinness
Pressure, she good for the image, I put her in vintage
I'ma take care of the business, drop a bag, it hit different
I'ma give away my thots for a rich bitch, woo
Fuck me, and call me toxic, she no different
Every time I pull out my cock, she gon' kiss it
Mouthing me off in the car, she just kiss it (mwah)
I'm pressurelicious, yeah
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave her
Take a picture of my bag, now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass, now your nigga pressed to hit it (baow), pressurelicious
Hold up, I'ma put my demon in her veins, for sure
Ayy, you know I like Chanel, daddy, keep me in Coco ('co)
I'ma hit it, and I'm gon' keep on all my chains, for sure
Gotta treat these niggas like birds, I get that bread, then I go, ah
