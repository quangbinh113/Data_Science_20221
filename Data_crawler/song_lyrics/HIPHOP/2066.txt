Song Name: Shook Ones, Pt. II
Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and the hundred dollar billers
For real, niggas who ain't got no feelings
Check it out now
I got you stuck off the realness
We be the infamous, you heard of us
Official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped with warfare
Beware of my crime family
Who got 'nuff shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face
Stab your brain with your nose bone
You're all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for their self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin' like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a playa
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight
My gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only 19 but my mind is older
And when the things get for real
My warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nuttin' really, ay yo dun, fuck the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile, back in Queens the realness is foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burning sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one
For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money
It's all good, you wha'msayin'? Yeah
