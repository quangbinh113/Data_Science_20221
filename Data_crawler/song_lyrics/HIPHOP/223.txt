Song Name: Feelin Like
Ooh, feelin' like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like my lucks up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like, yeah
Drive this foreign fast and I'm not crashing it
Got to pound the gas and my passion that I'm not stashin' it
Fuck you, talk like you begin and you ain't having it
Niggas talkin' like they be havin' chips, they ain't havin' it
Sig' that's on me bitch, I will not pull 'cause I'm stashin' it
Fuck you, niggas mad at me 'cause I'm not asking it
Niggas mad at me 'cause I rollin' up like a massacre
Probably fuck 'em trees and tell her Popeye like an acronym
Ooh, yeah, got me feelin' fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ohh, money no, I got ton, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, live with no regrets now
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like I fucked up
It's like ooh, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like I fucked up
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
Daddy got one, no, I would not roll it if it is the mids
Purple dropper but my shit is cherry, 'cause it's Hi-Tech red
Talkin' 'bout something, I got change or something
Should I change or something
I'm up one
Should I change or something
Change the game or something
Give a fuck, life a party bitch, nobody got my stack
Got my brothers
But they distant 'cause them niggas hold me back
I'm just different, I'm just gifted
They like why you go like that
Keep it lifted, with precision
Know I bang it tell this track
Like ooh, feelin' like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ohh, yeah, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, yeah, feelin' like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh, feelin' like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like, yeah
