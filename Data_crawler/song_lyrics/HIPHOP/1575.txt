Song Name: Playa (with Gunna)
Rick Owen lens (player)
Who there hoppin' out the Benz? (Player)
Ooh, I'm fuckin' on her friends
Two, I pull up with twins (slatt)
Mink flow, she on her shins (player)
Deep-throat, I'm goin' in (player)
My crew done fucked all of her friends (player)
We here so they know to come in
Rich nigga stunts, let my bitch, spread the new 'Bach-'Bach truck
Gunna, look what you did (look at it)
Too many hoes to be showin' me
Too many love gettin' too much of this dick
Too many shows, I been takin' too many drugs
I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm lit,"
Soon as I bust, told her, "Split"
She looked at my face, like, "You son of a bitch"
Mix Codeine and soda like cheese in the grits
I told her come over, she wanna get hit
I bend that shit over and stroke on my other hoe, lickin' her clit
Player
I'm in and out like a stitch
My dick like a drug, get a fix
Gave her a dub, but I'm far from a trick
Throw that shit up and I swear I won't miss

We here so they know to come in
Lost a few friends, but I made lots of Ms, so whatever, like, fuck it, I'm rich (I am)
Too many bags I've been gettin', got too many hoes, I forgot that I hit
Work when I want, but they pay me a lot every time that I put in a shift
Price gettin' higher, but I still be pourin' a eight, every time that I sip (let's go)
I hit the gas and I blow her a kiss
Engine be talkin', my wrist got some lip (skrrt)
My mama a Rover, I made my dad cry when I bought him a Benz (cry)
Player, everythin' lit
You hear my chains in my song when I'm poppin' my shit
And I ain't DM her twice 'cause she answered me on the first time that I slid
Bitches move funny, it ain't about money, I really don't care about it
Keepin' it player, I'm never gon' change who I am just to front to a bitch
Don't got no feelings and I see a heart every time that she bendin' it over
Never gon' settle, my mind is gone with the wind, if I'm wifin' or blow her
