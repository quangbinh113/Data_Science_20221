Song Name: All In
Cook that shit up, Quay
My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contact full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that mask tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the Migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I woulda knew that shit, I woulda been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston, in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York
I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wanna show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the lay-up
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lamb' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm bitin' out that Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother bidness
Just know that they gettin' millions
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in
This house rise every way, she callin' more friends
My world or none, ain't mine, I cannot bargain
Sippin' wockiana, come here thotiana
Let me buss you down, ah, yah, yah
What kinda watch you wanted?
Man, that's nothin', mami
I'm not bein' funny, ah, yah, yah
I shoulda knew you was gon' rat the day you told me
A hundred racks in all dubs, it ain't no foldin' me
I ain't no puppet, ain't with nobody controllin' me
I go LeBron when it's crunch time, it ain't no holdin' me
Got the Maybach, Benz truck, I'm tryna buy one
I told lil' shawty, "Just let bygones be bygones"
Tell the Feds get off my dick, I don't gotta buy guns
Ain't got the right one, yeah
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in
This house rise every way, she callin' more friends
My world or none, ain't mine, I cannot bargain

To let the doors in
I'm goin' all in
She callin' more friends
I cannot bargain
