Song Name: Reply (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)
Woah, if I write
If I write you girl, will you reply?
Follow my commands, come on girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all the lies in your eyes
But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight
Just so I can have my way, rubbin' on your thighs
In the morning, go back home
Because I do not have no ties
Yeah, but if I, if I write you, girl
Tell me would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night (yeah, yeah)
You don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (yeah, yeah)
What if I was to put my life up on the line? (on the line)
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket, you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry
Uh, cry for me, for me now (uh)
No one can slow me down (uh)
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off of Perc', gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into it 'til she numb
Every time she moan, she be like, uh
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game
'Cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist, go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better, baby, just pray about it
I play your body but don't you go be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more
Before you changed your body
And you did your body, girl
Yeah, you really changed your body
There's couples out here that's not eatin' we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, there ain't no way around it
Ain't nothin' to say about it
Got niggas, pull up and spray about it
I'm gone (yeah)
And when I say, I'm gone
Don't you say it right after me
Like it's some sing-along shit
You got mad when I said
That you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this
Make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl just take it off
I knew that you was nasty, the way you take it raw
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy, girl
If I, woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
But what if I put on a disguise for the night?
And I can see all the lies in your eyes (yeah, yeah)
You don't want this type of guy in your life
In the morning, go back home
Because I do not have no ties (yeah)
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
Yeah, if I write you can you reply?
