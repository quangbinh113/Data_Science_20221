Song Name: Bringing It Back
(AoM)
This ten-ten keeps talkin' 'bout Nandos
While I'm in the studio makin' a track
But I don't know 'bout that right now
I'm tryna stack me an M, so I still can't lack
Young boy, had to take trips 'round the map
No Ps, can't be livin' like that
So I'm in the studio, I'm makin' them slap
No E1 track, but I'm bringin' it back
Still, I'm bringin' it back like Trent with that corner
They can't say that I'm out of order
Went from bando settings with T
Now, we're sat there, doin' up meetings in Warner
Got a bad one tryna chat about AP
While I'm tryna stack me dough for an AP (Stackin')
I can't slip and let no bitch play me
I'm bringin' it back like AJ Tracey
Where I'm from, you've gotta take that risk
Had me out on the pitch and he kept on scorin'
And you know (You've got no fans)
'Cause your tunes don't bang and your raps are borin' (Haha-haha)
It feels normal whеn I'm on stage
'Cah before dеm shows, I was out there tourin'
I-I-I, I hit the re, bounced out for a sec'
Then flew back in for the very next mornin' (Flew back)
This ten-ten keeps talkin' 'bout Nandos
While I'm in the studio makin' a track
But I don't know 'bout that right now
I'm tryna stack me an M, so I still can't lack
Young boy, had to take trips 'round the map
No Ps, can't be livin' like that
So I'm in the studio, I'm makin' them slap
No E1 track, but I'm bringin' it back
Up in OT, in mad whips tryna blend in
But dey don't know 'bout that, they're pretendin' (Uh-huh)
Bro's frontline with bits re-offendin'
Say what I think, don't care who I'm offendin'
Come a long way from them days we were lendin'
Plus he knows it's on, it's not mendin'
I'm landin', trust he knows I'm not sendin'
Pendin', hit the charts, now, I'm trendin'
This ten-ten keeps talkin' 'bout Nandos
While I'm in the studio makin' a track (Trust)
But I don't know 'bout that right now
I'm tryna stack me an M, so I still can't lack
Young boy, had to take trips 'round the map
No Ps, can't be livin' like that
So I'm in the studio, I'm makin' them slap
No E1 track, but I'm bringin' it back (Bringin' it back, uh)
This ten-ten keeps talkin' 'bout Nandos
While I'm in the studio makin' a track
But I don't know 'bout that right now
I'm tryna stack me an M, so I still can't lack
Young boy, had to take trips 'round the map
No Ps, can't be livin' like that
So I'm in the studio, I'm makin' them slap
No E1 track, but I'm bringin' it back
