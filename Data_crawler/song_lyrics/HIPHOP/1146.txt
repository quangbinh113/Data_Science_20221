Song Name: STICKED UP (feat. 21 Savage)
(Uzoma, come here)
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh, oh-yeah
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh, oh-yeah
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh, oh-yeah
Fuck it I'm-
Ayy, look
Fuck shit, I'm not having that, nah
Can't see these fuck niggas, cataracts
I'm shittin' (brr), imagine that
Please don't trip on her, you can have her back
Real nigga stand on all ten toes
When nobody got your back, you better have a back
If I 'on't got a damn thing, I better got a strap
Swerving my Mercedes-Benz like the bitch a Cadillac
Nigga I'm-
Blicked up, sticked up
Blicked up, sticked up
Blicked up, sticked up (let's go)
Blicked up, yeah
Sometimes I don't gotta speak (uh-huh)
Sometimes she just pull out and eat (let's go)
Ooh, you a whole lotta freak (ooh, ooh)
You my boo, hit my phone, I won't cheat (ooh, ooh)
Type of pussy make you go to jail
Okay, how much my bond? That shit cheap (shit cheap)
Pick me up from my side when I'm free (uh-huh!)
That lil' pussy, that mine, that shit me (shit me)
I sit back and roll up while she spit on it
Got a nigga ready to bet on it
She ain't putting that shit on me
Got a nigga doing extra shit like the lil' lamest bitch right here
She got some game, it fucked me up
I had to go run it with big homie
Like, "OG why I like it so much?" (Like it)
Why her pussy so tight when we fuck?
Look her dead in the eyes, "Bitch, you gone be my wifey or what?"
She say, "No-ooh-oh-oh" (hahaha)
Damn, that's fucked up
But fuck it, I'm-
Sticked up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blicked up, sticked up (yeah)
Blicked up (yeah), sticked up (yeah, yeah, bitch I'm)
Blicked up (yeah, thugging, I'm, huh?)
Sticked up (yeah, yeah), blicked up (boom)
Sticked up (yeah), blicked up (let's go)
Sticked up (21)
Chop in the back and it came with a scope
People took from me, I gave them the most
You niggas small fries, I got a coupon
Mention my name and it come with free smoke
You wanna slide, I show you the ropes
Bring you some gloves, but don't bring your phone
Tell your bitch that you might not make it home
Own up for your actions, nigga, we grown
Blicked up (21), everywhere I go, I got it filled up (21)
All the hotboxes we done pilled up (21)
Plenty times nigga could've killed us (21)
Shot me six times, I ain't bitch up (21)
Stood toe-to-toe with the best of 'em (21)
FN bullets for the rest of 'em (21)
She been on my mind, let me text her (21)
Niggas wanna cuff, arrest her (21)
Still daydream how I sexed her (21)
That pussy just get wetter (21)
Get you out your panties, I'm clever (21)
When it come to pretty women, got several (on god)
I'm in Bottega buyin' leather (on god)
Sticks up like I got a vendetta (on god)
Keep a chopper 'cause it guard my cheddar (on god)
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
