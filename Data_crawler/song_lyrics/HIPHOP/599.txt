Song Name: gone girl
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' (Yeah)
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fuckin' with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
Tell me what it is (What), made my heart break (Yeah)
Saying that it's me (Huh), but you know it ain't (Nah)
Took a few pills (Yeah), I can't feel a thing (Whoa)
Got me in my feels, sippin' on drank
Tryna, tryna, tryna keep it real, girl, you really ain't (Fuck)
You know what's the deal, you can't get a thing (Thing)
Sayin' that it hurt, charge it to the game (Game)
Sayin' I'm a joke, laughin' to the bank (Bank)
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now
I need you right now
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fuckin' with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
I just want the love, baby, not the lust (Yeah, yeah)
Caught up in a daze, man, I need your trust (Peace)
All up in a maze, left you in the dust (Yeah)
Gone in a Wraith, see the stars in a Wraith
You see the stars in the day (Day), bitch
Have you been to Mars on a date? (Date), bitch
I can take yo' ass to Mars in a day (Day), bitch
I can take yo' ass to Mars today, bitch, yeah
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now (Yeah)
I need you right now (Yeah)
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fuckin' with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
