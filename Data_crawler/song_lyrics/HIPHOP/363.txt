Song Name: hate will never win
—Ference, but a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about
The great things that we're doing
With the Secretary on the Veterans Administration
And we will talk about that
Very much so in a little while, but I thought I should
Put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville, so
Again, I wanna thank everybody for being here
In particular, I want to thank
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false loves, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false loves, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse
Why the fuck should I apologize?
Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag
Dicksuckers with ties (great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
And where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind that flies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
This has been going on for a long, long time
Why?
It has no place in America
Why?
What is vital now is a swift
Why?
Restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety
And security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid
To go outside
And play
