Song Name: BLOW OUT (Prod. Czaer)
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Why did you show off?
I still don't know about your color
You ain't got no altar, here's too many bluffers
I still don't know why you shuffle
Hey little turtles, you better run as fast as you can
Stay in the cave, secret agent
Like James, I'm 'bout to teach you
About how to dance
I'm a gentleman
With only few words, I can make you bleed
But you have to clean your own sheet
Nobody can replace me
Nobody can resist me
I'm a 21st century version Hermes
I'm a god's envoy, look at my family
We need no fucking Bentley
'Cause all the people come to me by themselves
We don't need to go anywhere
I don't waste my time on anybody
I'm a businessman, stick to the plan
Enjoy this game, I'm the new brand
But you can never get this
Because, your style is fucking lame (ah)
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
When I show up, you can be my hater
아님, be my fan
내가 늦을 순 없잖아, 축제 시간에
When the beat drop, 느낌왔네
여기는 기간제 다수는 지망생
근대 알잖아, 노래방은 시간제
Bruh, chill out, 몇몇은 눈치봤네
누군 벌어놨지 진작에 집한채를 중간에서
넌 왜 늘 그렇게 심각해?
Uh, who can roast the most?
게임의 보스가 되려면 포코페이스 유지
계속 헤엄치기
난 flow 깔별로 골라서, 맘데로 골라써
중간선 탄 자식들은 결국엔 안좋은 꼴났어
착해빠진 내 전여친 마냥 사랑을 왜
넌 자꾸 구걸해, 난 재밌는건 두번해
별사탕 같은 놈들 호주머니에
여섯살 꼬맹이 처럼, 다 털어먹네, yeah
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
I feel like a dragon, I feel like a giant
I feel something, like a supernatural
I feel like a dragon, I feel like a giant
I feel something, like a supernatural (ow!)
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
Make them blow out, like a dragon, we on fire
