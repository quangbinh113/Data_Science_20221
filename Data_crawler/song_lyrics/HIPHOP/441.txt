Yeah
Oh, yeah

Woah-oh-woah
Two-tone drip, yeah
Woah-oh-woah
Walkin' like a lick, yeah
Woah-oh-woah
Pull up with a stick, yeah
Woah-oh-woah, oh
You know how it get, yeah
Making my way downtown, I got options (Ooh)
Could pull up on you right now, but I got options (Ooh)
Is you f-----' right now? 'Cause I got options (Ooh)
You ain't gotta lie now 'cause I got options
Uh, you move right or get left, only option
If you ain't with the gang, you the opps then
Got plays like a SportsCenter Top 10
Get popped or get dropped, you got options
Yeah, I could do the white, yellow, or the rose gold
Prostitutes in the winter, all them hoes cold
Got a Rollie, got a Patek, got a Richard Mille
Times change, I'm just sayin', gotta switch up, feel me?
The fake do what they can
The real do what they want
Multitaskin' with the baddies, that's two things at once
Yeah, so nice I did it twice, baby
Yeah, and one is so close to none, baby
Woah-oh-woah
Two-tone drip, yeah
Woah-oh-woah
Walkin' like a lick, yeah
Woah-oh-woah

Could pull up on you right now, but I got options (Yeah) (Ooh)
Is you f-----' right now? 'Cause I got options (Huh?) (Ooh)
You ain't gotta lie now 'cause I got options (Go)
Hardtop convertible, f--- it, I got the option (Drop)
Do a one touch of her butt and it's how I'm rockin' (Huh)
Fab and Gucci Mane pull up in the 2020 (Skrr, it's Gucci)
Paid 400, ain't talkin' no 2020s (More now)
Millions on top of more millions on top of millions (Blessed)
Shinin' like the chandelier hangin' top of the ceiling (Brr)
Rappers ain't eatin' right now, they malnutritioned (Huh?)
Two options: you're either with me or against me (It's Gucci)
Woah-oh-woah
Two-tone drip, yeah

You ain't gotta lie now 'cause I got options (2 Chainz)
It's two-tone Tony, got two tones on (Uh)
Brick, no soda, my wrist done gold (Uh)
My fist done froze and I pissed our opponents (Uh)
B---- don't know me, I keep on rollin', yeah
You know I'm smooth like cocoa butter
Loco lover, called her and I'm like, "What rubber?"
See that's raw-raw (Raw)
She call me daddy, call me Paw-paw (Paw)
I heard your girl like that white, I'm talkin' pow-wow (Wow)
Sometimes I feel like talkin', sometimes I don't (Sometimes I don't)
I got options, I get what I want (What I want)
So what's poppin'? The ball is in your court (In your court)
Like I'm Rodman, I play them like a sport, uh (Rebound)
