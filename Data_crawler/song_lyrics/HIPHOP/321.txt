Song Name: Ruthless (feat. Jay Critch)
No, no
Lil Tjay, yeah
Yo, yo, yo
RellyMade
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet little nigga
I ain't never gon'...
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet little nigga
I ain't never gonna extend my hand
If we too deep versus the whole block deep
Swear to God I ain't ever gonna fail my mans
Money gon' come like the money gon' go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gon' ride 'til the car can't drive
New drip had to pick up some sauce
New kicks I don't care what it cost
Ruthless I don't care who lost
Stupid I done turned to a boss
And I know
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
When I come from there's a whole lotta gang shit
As a youngin I just wanted to be famous
Hopped in the booth to your screen, now we made it
Other day I was recording in the basement
Now I pull up to a show in a spaceship
How you screamin' "day one" doing fake shit?
Nowadays bad bitches wanna taste it
Pull up on the S, show love, that be gang shit
And if they let me in the game I'ma change it
Ain't a lotta niggas saying that I'm a basic
Pop it, I'ma stain, Balmains and some bape shit
Niggas see me they ain't ever gon' say shit
Buss down they ain't never gone take this
Money I got lil nigga can't make this
Countin' blue strips broke niggas gonna hate this
Mama so proud I'ma take her on vacation
I be goin' hard
Remember used to starve
Remember selling nicks right on the boulevard
Going downtown try to steal a nigga car
And if I call Tut he'll pull a nigga card
I don't play the field no more without a hammer
Brodie on the news whole face on the camera
Free all my day one niggas out the slammer
Opp nigga told black and white he a panda
Got me finna run up in his crib like I'm Santa
All this designer got me broads in Atlanta
Honestly I ain't playin games no more
And they be on my dick 'til my thing feel sore
Bitch said I'm trash shorty change your draws
I ain't worried 'bout you why you worried about me
I'ma still popout with a fresh white tee
With some retro J's and some fresh Nike's
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet little nigga
I ain't never gonna extend my hand
If we too deep vs the whole block deep
Swear to god I ain't ever gonna fail my mans
Money gonna come like the money gonna go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gone ride til the car can't drive
New drip had to pick up some sauce
New kicks I don't care what it cost
Ruthless I don't care who lost
Stupid I done turned to a boss
And I know
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
Check up they don't wan' see me win
Flex up I'ma jump out the gym
New water watch that young boy swim
I got it the harder way like I'm Tim
In that Maybach you can't see through the tint
I rock foreign but bro in a stolie
Had to make me some plays on my doli
Think I made it these bitches all on me
No, this is not a chain, this a trophy
Boss up he a baby like Jody
Used to go hit a stain for the OZ's
When I put on the ice it be OD
I'm talkin money put that cash on a threeway
Doin' the dash on the freeway
I knew I would get it they didn't believe me
Baby, I make it look easy
Your bitch keep callin' and sayin' she need me
I know she see me with Tjay
I'm sippin' fours of the drink moving slow mo'
But my whip through speed race
She wanna link up a hoe
That's a no go
I be stackin' my cheese cake
Yeah I get to the racks and I'm up by the rim
Collecting 'em back and I do it again
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet little nigga
I ain't never gonna extend my hand
If we too deep versus the whole block deep
Swear to god I ain't ever gonna fail my mans
Money gonna come like the money gonna go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gone ride til the car can't drive
New drip had to pick up some sauce
New kicks I don't care what it cost
Ruthless I don't care who lost
Stupid I done turned to a boss
And I know
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
No, no
Gang, gang
Yeah
They don't wanna see the young boy win
No, no
Yeah, yeah
Gang, gang, gang, gang
