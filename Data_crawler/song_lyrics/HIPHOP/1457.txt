Song Name: Ni**as In Paris
We're gonna skate to one song and one song only
(Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me)
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
When I look at you like "This shit gravy!"
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
Ball so hard, but since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable
To go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock
Rolex's that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
B-Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
B-Ball so hard, let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
B-Ball so hard, bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-towns, D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray
That shit cray
That shit cray
B-Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray
That shit cray
That shit cray
She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray
That shit cray
Ain't it Jay?
B-Ball so hard
What she order?
What she order?
Fish fillet?
B-Ball so hard
Your whip so cold
Whip so cold
This old thing?
Ball so hard
Act like you'll never be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she 'on't wanna dance
'Scuse my French, but I'm in France
Hehe, I'm just sayin'
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would've-
Married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga?
What's Louis, my killa?
What's drugs, my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
'Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, heh?
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means
But it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
I got that hot bitch in my home
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The Stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know I got that feeling?
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
