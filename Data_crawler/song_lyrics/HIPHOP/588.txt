Song Name: Blue Pill
Oooooo-ooooo-oooooh, aaaah
I've been gettin' drunk as fuck
At night, can't sleep
Multiplying toes on me
Out here, yeah, out here
Yeah
(Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga)
We go up (straight up), in the valley (in the valley)
Where they spend mills, on the manors
Please, hurry up with my valet (with my valet)
Ain't got no time, no time, no time
No time, no time, no time, no time
Pop 'em all (pop 'em all)
You know, what up (you know what up)
Call me up, when it's over (when it's over)
In the hills, we get hi-iii-high (we get high)
That's why I'm floatin' off that blue pill, blue dream
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (straight up)
I'm a rockstar rollin', Shabba, I got ranks
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't
I'm rollin' off that blue pill, blue dream
It got me like I-I-I-I-I
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't
I'm a rollin' rockstar, Shabba, I got ranks
I sniffed 4 Xans', you ain't notice
That's why you ghosts; hocus pocus
Take a trip out wild west
No alcohol, lean and soda
Can't last one night with the best
I'm goin' on six hangovers
Cuzzo still whippin' that 'Yota
He gettin' close to that Rover, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, why, why, why? Why, why, why?
La Flame, he got that fi-ya-ya
That's why I'm floatin' off that blue pill, blue dream
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (straight up)
I'm a rockstar rollin', Shabba, I got ranks
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't
I'm rollin' off that blue pill, blue dream
It got me like I-I-I-I-I
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't
I'm a rollin' rockstar, Shabba, I got ranks
Oh, why, why, why? Why, why, why?
La Flame, he got that fi-ya-ya, ya dig?
Oooooo-ooooo-oooooh, aaaah
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Yeah, ya-ya-yaaah, ya-ya-yaaah
Wah-wah-woooh, wah-wah-woooh
Blue dream, ooh, ooh
