Song Name: Open Arms
No judging
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
Open arms, right here (right here)
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
Yeah, the streets welcomed with me open arms
But it ain't offer us nothin' except these broken hearts
We grew up together 'til niggas grown apart
Then reunite in they prisons soon as they open yard (uh)
Dope fiend rentals turn into stolen cars
Blood that was 'posed to be lacin' us tryna overcharge
Did a year and left lil' bro in charge
Double back and now he more in charge
We ain't pourin' Par
I'm in a Lamb' like it's my only car
I'm showin' bars and I'm throwin' bars, stitchin' up this open heart
He took his time and they make no remarks
Forever schemin', I have no regards
No judging
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
Oh, no judging (open arms, right here) (right here)
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
We throw up 4s around this bitch, the thumb been amputated
Butterflies settin' in the Rollie, ain't no segregation
I'm on my way to grab this guala, what's your destination?
They killed that man in front his kids without no hesitation
Franklin faces by the bricks and you can keep the dubs
My niggas poppin' when we shoppin', ain't no piecin' up
She couldn't keep it real for nothin', told her, "Keep in touch"
Applyin' pressure where it's needed, ain't no easin' up
We leasin' what? This off the lot, I paid an easy buck
Crate of guns, I'm finna load 'em all and grease 'em up
I heard you boys been teamin' up, that's what you need for us
You better watch the shit you post if niggas beef with us
No judging
You took me in (you took me in) with open arms (with open arms)
With open arms (oh)
Oh, no judging (open arms, right here)
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
No judging (no judgement)
You took me in (you took me in) with open arms (with open arms)
With open arms (with open arms)
Open arms, right here (right here)
You took me in (oh, yeah, she did) with open arms (hey, hey)
With open arms (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, judging
You took me in with open arms
With open arms
Open arms, right here (right here)
You took me in with open arms
