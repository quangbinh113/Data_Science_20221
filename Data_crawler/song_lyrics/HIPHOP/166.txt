Song Name: Don't Come Out The House (with 21 Savage)
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
13, got my first stripe, first stripe
Glenwood road, where they shiest, nigga
Slaughter Gang so I keep a knife, nigga
We was broke so all we ate was rice, nigga
Paid the J's to cut on my mama's lights, nigga
Come get your bitch
She tryna spend the night, nigga (Straight up)
You a bitch, that make her a dyke, nigga (Pussy)
All these bodies, I can't sleep at night, nigga
Y'all must thought that
I was gon' whisper the whole time (21)
I ran out of weed
I sent your bitch out of town (On God)
Gave her fifteen hundred
And she came back with pounds (Straight up)
Rappers think they it
But they really just clowns (On God)
Gucci store, a hundred thou'
That's just in a day (On God)
Always cheatin', I'm a dog
Think I need a cage (On God)
Savage loaded, chips and dip
I'm not talkin' 'bout Lays (21)
Throwback Rafs, call 'em retros
I'm not talkin' 'bout J's (21)
First name 21, last name Hefner
I got too many freaks (21)
Levi jeans, low self-esteem
He on BlackPeopleMeet (21)
Look like Maya, she's on fire
Who got the keys to my Jeep? (Straight up)
Who want smoke 'cause I want smoke
I had a wet dream about beef (21)
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Kids see my car, they get to playin'
Bingo (Skrrt skrrt)
Off-brand rappers stealin'
All the lingo (I did that first)
Thirty on my hip, the label
Want a singles (On God)
I green light hits
I don't make jingles (Straight up)
Shut your damn mouth 'fore you drop
Nigga (Drop nigga)
Last nigga dissed me dropped
Nigga (Straight up)
I want smoke nigga, all nigga (On God)
Savage kill all of his opps nigga (21)
Smoke the mall last week, ball nigga (21)
Slaughter Gang
Yeah we brawl nigga (Straight up)
4L Gang, lot of shots nigga
Savage kill all of his opps nigga (Pussy)
If Young Metro don't trust you
I'm gon' shoot you
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
