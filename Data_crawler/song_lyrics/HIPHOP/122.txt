Song Name: WRLD On Drugs
Feel like
I'm working on dying
The world on drugs
(Drugs)
Think I need a fix
The world on drugs, can you give me some?
I don't feel no pain cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs
The world on drugs, yeah the world on drugs
I can hear these voices in my head
If I'm sober then I might be dead
I can see the devil in my bed (in my bed)
I was born a rebel I'm not scared (rebel)
You been takin drugs, and you been hidin' it from me
You been takin drugs, and you've been lyin' to me
I don't believe it, I done popped off, I don't believe you
You a knockoff, I don't believe you
Gone and pop off
Cause the world on Drugs (the world on drugs)
Cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Cause the world, cause the world
Cause the world on drugs
Cause the world on drugs
She ate the molly in the party, got your girl on drugs
You ain't have to pay for none of these Percy's bitch the pills on us
You ain't gotta pay me for my time, bitch the thrills on us
It's all Love, it's all love
I can't feel my motherfuckin' face, so worried
I'm numb nigga chopped on me with the drum nigga
If you run up on me you a dumb nigga
Shoot shit, ahh
Molly in my body, Imma boot shit ahh
I don't see nobody gettin' high like us
Ay, I don't believe it, I done popped off, I don't believe you
You a knockoff, I don't believe you
Gone and pop off
Cause the world on drugs
Cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Cause the world, cause the world
Cause the world, cause the world
Cause the world on drugs
I came in stylin', I don't need a stylist (don't need a stylist)
Yeah I'm good on deposits, I don't need a wallet
Bout to go up, call me Scotty
I'm boutta go up, you can pass me a water
I pop the pills in the Rari
Had lil' mamma gone in the passenger
You tryna sneak and get high
You need to come talk with me
I just be actin' shy, poppin' these mollies
I can never be sober
I'mma come knockin' at your door like Jehova
Girl, I brought us a pill, let's go take it
I brought us a chronic, ain't gon' lace it
We been in the club in the matrix
There's not a better feelin', no replacin' it
The world on drugs, can you give me some
I don't feel no pain cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs, yeah the world on drugs
The world on drugs
I can hear these voices in my head, if I'm sober then I might be dead
I can see the devil in my bed (in my bed)
I was born a rebel I'm not scared (I'm a rebel)
You been takin drugs, and you been hidin' it from me (hidin')
You been takin drugs, and you've been lyin' to me (yeah)
I don't believe it, I done popped off,
I don't believe you (I don't believe you)
You a knockoff, I don't believe you (don't believe you)
Gone and pop off
Cause the world on drugs
