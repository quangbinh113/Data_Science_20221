Do a trick with the stick, it's amazing (stick)
In the bando, trapping out vacants (bando)
Locs on like I'm starring in The Matrix (Matrix)
I keep the cookie like my grandma made it (cookie)
I keep the keys and the pounds and the babies (keys)
And the bricks came white like Shady (white)
Drive the Lambo' through the avenue (skrrt)
Pretty lil' bih with a attitude (bad)
Give a shout-out to the white boy (boys)
All white Rolls look radical (radical)
Keep you a fire, don't let them take it (no)
If they get yours, you gotta get straightenin' (straightenin')
I catch a opp, I give him a facelift (opp)
My niggas lurking and spinning the day-shift (lurk)
I got them racks when you see me (rackades)
Spin back to back, it's a repeat (spin)
Championship, it's a three-peat (three)
Shoot out the window like Drizzy and Freaky (freak)

Automatic handgun like the Navy (automatic, raow)
I keep a hundred round drum, I ain't fading (paow-paow)
Turn a nigga to a mummy with the payment (woo, woo)
Terminate him with the money, it was gravy (terminator)
Spin an opp block, rock-a-bye, baby (rock-a-bye)
Made his heart stop, made his mama hate me (make 'em hate me)
We were trapping out the spot out the basement (out the spot)
Tasmanian Devil, we spin on your block (spin)
I pop a Perc', and I'm going berserk (woah, woah)
And I woke up and bought me a drop (like fuck it)
Straight to the point, I get straight to the straightenin'
Your buddy, he can't even walk (straight, straight)
We gutted him, nobody talk (we gutted him)
New Cullinan, stars start to fall (New Cullinan)
Trapping and hustling, beat down the walls (beat down)
I'm with the steppa, Nawfside repper (Nawf)
Qua' keep a MAC in the back of the Tesla (Qua')
I'm with the gang, we could never be selfish (gang, gang-gang-gang)
Watch how I dress, I'm the dripping professor
Saw the Kel-Tec, then I bought a compressor (Kel-Tec)
