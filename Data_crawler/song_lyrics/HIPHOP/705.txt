Song Name: Hello (feat. A Boogie Wit da Hoodie)
Rico's going crazy again
Yeah (Uh?)
(CashMoney, CashMoney)
Look, look (AP)
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Light skin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Light skin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I been so gone, I like redbones
My type, light skin, ass fat, Jell-O (huh?)
But bitches be switchin' sides nowadays on the regular
I never respected it, money over bitches, I know that's everything
Money over bitches, I know that's hot
Rockin' VVS by Elliot wedding bands
I will never ever give her no wedding ring
.45 on my hip, I ain't fightin' 'em
Chewin' on an Aderall like a vitamin
Niggas pockets be on E
Something they already know but I'm drivin' a T
They makin' up rumors and lies, okay, I'm sick and I'm tired
I'm mighty fatigued, none of my bitches be mine
They coulda been one of yours, but they out of your league
I'ma just call up Fatima, nah, that ain't really her name
But she for the team
I get fly as a bitch, like I looted up
All this money you talkin' ain't new to us
I'm the king of New York and on God
If Pop was alive, there would have been two of us
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
Pull up like Ace from the cleaners, Ace and I finesse
Pop make a movie, sell out arenas
She off the white, talkin' Demi Lovato
All on my denims, since Murder Bravado
AP Audemar, wet Aquafina
Hittin' like Ike, singin' like Tina
Dior on my body, sneakers got no creases
They limited, baby tell me if you've seen 'em
My diamonds dancin', paint her face like Marilyn Manson
Then roll up that Woo, Runtz straight from Cali'
Then get a plate from Sally's
Quano blew his trial, they set him up
These niggas mad as fuck
You know what I rep, yeah, it's tatted up
You ain't get fucked, 'cause your ass ain't fat enough
If you talk crazy, get batted up, yeah
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I like my bitches, redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the Regis and Pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
