Song Name: We Win (Space Jam: A New Legacy) (and Kirk Franklin)
Steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the-
Steadfast, unmovable (I wanna talk to ya)
Always abounding in- (I wanna talk to ya)
Just Blaze (woo)
We win, yes sir
We win, yes sir

And we win, yes sir (I believe that)
With you by my side, together
We can touch the sky, see we win
We will be better than ever
Made a promise, we can do it together
And I ain't breakin' my word
I just wish that I could fly like a bird
Get away from this Earth
Had to pray and pray, I felt I was cursed
Always tell myself it could have been worse
Nеver goin' back, I broke the rеverse
It come from my soul, no need to rehearse
Lot of time, I was in need of work
Talked to God like, "I need this to work"
Jumped the line like I needed it first
But I was bein' selfish
Know this gon' affect a lot of people, I was being careless
Took a break and stepped away, I'm comin' back when I get ready
I know this break people into pieces, but I ain't gon' let it
Yo Blaze, you crazy for this one
Ayy, all the champions out there
Feel so good
Ayy, I said it feel so good
(We win, yes sir) we will, we will, we will, we will, we will
We will, we will, we will, we will, we will (yeah)
(We win, yes sir) we will, we will, we will, we will, we will
We will, we will, we will, we will, we will (we gon' make it)
(We win, yes sir)
What didn't break me, made me better
I believe that
With you by my side, together
We can touch the sky, see we win, let's go
Strivin' for greatness
At the same time, keepin' my patience
Can't be racin' to no early grave, I'm cool with this pacin'
I could drop at any given time, I'm holdin' my aces
I've seen disappointment in all of their faces
The turtle still cross the finish line
We done raised the bar so many times
It's only right they give me mine
Diamond by myself, together we really shine
Long as I keep puttin' my faith and trust in God
I know that everything will be fine
Built for it, real stand up guy, they ain't never breakin' my kind
I believe I can do anything, I ain't never changin' my mind (preach)
Life's all about patience, take it one day at a time
Life's all about patience, take it one day at a time, yeah (yeah)
We win
Whatever you may be goin' through, we win (woo, come on)
We'll make it together, me and you, we win (and the beat play, woo)
And when the clouds they won't fade away (huh, everybody say it)
Don't you give up, you're one step closer, it's not the end (we gon' make it)
(We win, yes sir) we will, we will, we will, we will, we will
We will, we will, we will, we will, we will (I believe that)
(We win, yes sir) we will, we will, we will, we will, we will (I know that)
We will, we will, ain't gon' never let it break
(We win, yes sir) we will, we will, we will, we will, we will
We will, we will (I believe that)
With you by my side, huh, together
We can touch the sky, see we win
Unmovable, always abounding in the (we win)
Steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the (we win)
