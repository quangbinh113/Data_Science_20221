Song Name: Roll Dice
I, I am
I, I am
I, I am
I, I, I
I seen the Reap' come
Live my life, I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice, hmm
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, cold sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light
I just wanted my blue strips, never wanted fame
See bad bitches that'll fuck a lane
Keep all my brothers like fraternities
She don't speak no Englo' like I'm overseas
Spider make you smash out
I got niggas in the sandbox
I know they ain't about to rat all on me
My dawg's tongue got the padlock
Horsepower, bought an engine just to mash out
I'm 'bout to smash out, lean out the window with rags out, yeah, yeah
I seen the Reap' come
Live my life, I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice, hmm
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, cold sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light
I was starin' at the stars, seeing a UFO
I was high (I was high), really high (Really high)
Everybody, I got gold in my soul
I can't lie (Can't lie), no lie (No lie)
I never force a bye, I'm going to more high
I remember when moms cried
She wanted me to be law-abiding
At his neck like a violin
Got my brothers, we ain't buyin' friends
It started feelin' like my time again
Stay strong, don't fold, don't bend
Told her bend over, I'ma buy her a Benz
I seen the Reap' come
Live my life, I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice, hmm
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, cold sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light
I, I am
I, I am (Woo-woo, woo)
I, I am (Ice)
I, I, I (Ice)
I, I am (So bright)
I, I am (No white)
I, I am (Had to provide)
I, I, I
