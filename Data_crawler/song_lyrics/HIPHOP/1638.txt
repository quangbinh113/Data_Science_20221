Song Name: Sober (feat. Roddy Ricch & Post Malone)
She only like me when I'm sober, that's when I don't like me at all
She like fuckin', think you know her, she don't even answer when I call
I put her in a Rover, told her, "Girl, just be down for the call"
'Cause when I'm not sober, that's when I be down your walls
I like it faded (faded), I like you better when you naked (naked)
Put it in my face, I wanna taste it
Pour me a whole cup, fuck chasin' it (fuck chasin' it)
I'm in love with gold bottles and Don Juli'
I love 'em how I love slim bitches with big booties
It keep me in my mood, I be moody
And Mama always told me actin' hard kill all the coolies
So, I hope you answer when I call
'Cause I'm tryna pull up, kiss you, dick you down and all
Please don't kill the vibe bringin' up the alcohol
'Cause this is nothin' new if you knew me
She only like me when I'm sober, that's when I don't like me at all
She like fuckin', think you know her, she don't even answer when I call
I put her in a Rover, told her, "Girl, just be down for the call"
'Cause when I'm not sober, that's when I be down your walls
Got her dirty out the soda 'cause I'm never sober
Fell up ice to the brim, brim, brim, I like it colder
I've been sippin' promethazine ever since I blowed up
Stay away, these codeine demons got ahold of me
But, when I'm sober, that's the only time she love me
And when I poured up, she don't wanna be in my company
Even though I double C, five star, I don't do no double tree
These young niggas, they can't fuck with me
Been makin' big bucks when time get rough, can't kick the cup
Big cuban links and g-locks don't keep it tucked
Slide in floor seats with nice ice look like a puck
I'm still sippin' on this drink, I won't wanna give it up
She only like me when I'm sober, that's when I don't like me at all
She like fuckin', think you know her, she don't even answer when I call
I put her in a Rover, told her, "Girl, just be down for the call"
'Cause when I'm not sober, that's when I be down your walls
I was in the stu' with YG and got drunk
And I called you on the phone, baby, I was fucked up
Had my heart felt like it was hit with nunchucks
I didn't expect for us to split up
And I didn't think that you wouldn't talk to me for months
So I cracked one open like I was in Somalia
The wine taste shitty when you won't even talk to me (talk to me)
Mmm-hmm-mmm (talk to me)
Baby, I promise I'ma make you proud (ooh)
I'ma be a changed man when you come around
But thank God you don't want me back now
Wanna tell you that I love you, but the beer would fall out
She only like me when I'm sober, that's when I don't like me at all (ooh-ooh-ooh)
She like fuckin', think you know her, she don't even answer when I call (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I put her in a Rover, told her, "Girl, just be down for the call"
'Cause when I'm not sober, that's when I be down your walls
She only like me when I'm sober, that's when I don't like me at all
She like fuckin', think you know her, (damn) she don't even answer when I call
I put her in a Rover, told her, "Girl, just be down for the call"
'Cause when I'm not sober, that's when I be down your walls
'Cause when I'm not sober
'Cause when I'm not sober
'Cause when I'm not-
'Cause when I'm not sober
