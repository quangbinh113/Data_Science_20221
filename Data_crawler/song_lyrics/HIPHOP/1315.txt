Song Name: Purity (feat. Frank Ocean)
I've been busy
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, all sorta kinda busy
Like shawty is we fuckin', well if not, then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush, but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this and I need a minute
See, this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind

I gotta find peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind
Yeah, spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violence on the floor
Fast forward, honors on my skull, type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got the hands out like they acknowledging the Führer
Rewind Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, make sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Trying to dancin' it out, to make two at piece, alright
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour that foam, this white got eggshells in my omelette
My in-laws, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
My brain on drugs, I still ain't got no piece of mind, fuck
Woof woof, dogs in the place, loose tooth, lost in a fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rosé, brute force, brut Champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I spank a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable lone nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable store, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothing in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth chewin' on nothin'
You tweakin' or somethin', you reaching for something
You speak and speak up then you're thinking, you're overthinking
Unblinking and precumming
And that could turn every no one into someone
I gotta find peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind

I gotta find peace of mind
You make my heart desire pure
I gotta find peace of mind
You make my heart desire pure
I just need peace of mind for my purity
You make my heart desire pure, just tell me
You make my heart desire pure, just tell me
Memories burn the roach heads
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keeping me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old fam (I'm undone because)
Lost in the Google maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on my nigga hold that thought)
Nigga pour up soda nigga, hold that cough
Tryna hold back, the call had dropped when the FaceTime paused
Don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft spoken, roll something, cop something, Narco
Saint life Joan of Arc bro
Ring barcode
Two of everything
Should've been the blame when Noahs Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face to face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between
Since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost, nothing since September last
Seen her September sixteenth
Man it feels like (I'm undone because)
I lose someone every release
I feel like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Percy is gone and I grieve (I'm undone because)
I share with you my peace

I'm undone because
