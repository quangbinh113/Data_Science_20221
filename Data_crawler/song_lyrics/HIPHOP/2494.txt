Song Name: Speak Up
Thug Knockin'
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon' make a scene
Got lights, cameras, action, but I promise that I won't be seen
She told me that she love me but I knew that shh make-believe
But this ain't even 'bout her, so
Let me catch you up to speed
Red target, slaying demons
I be quick to put 'em on that
Red carpet, TMZ 'em
I could get 'em taken
After one call, Liam Neeson
I was mumblin', now, I'm speakin'
The feds can't ask me if I'm able to testify
'Cause I ain't The Weeknd
I walk through the valley of them shadows, I don't fear no evil
Devil ain't gon' dare to mess with me, I am not Knievel
We pop out with sticks and get the sword
It could get medieval
It's gon' be a movie when we slide, I ain't talkin' Regal
Fake shh get to the back
Real shh get to the front
I got the armor on me
I been fightin' these demons, I'm makin' 'em run
Flowin' like water to me
What does she want out of me?
I can't be messin' with succubus spirits
They can't take the soul out of me
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon'-
Speak up!
When I hop up out the cut, I promise I'm gon' make a scene
Got lights, cameras, action, but I promise that I won't be seen
She told me that she love me but I knew that shh make-believe
But this ain't even 'bout her, so
Let me catch you up to speed
Red target, slaying demons
I be quick to put 'em on that
Red carpet, TMZ 'em
I could get 'em taken
After one call, Liam Neeson
I was mumblin', now, I'm speakin'
The feds can't ask me if I'm able to testify
'Cause I ain't The Weeknd
