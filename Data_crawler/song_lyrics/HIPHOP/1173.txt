Song Name: Rock N Roll
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Take off like airplanes, like slaves, we wear chains
Drive-by, I'm bare-faced, Remmie don't care, chase
Wait 'til it's time, slide with a new Glock and a pair of skates
Lil' bro let shots fly, if they shot by, that's a fair trade
He tried, got knocked by one of my pipes, now he scared straight
Ever since they got by one of my guys, I want their brains
Made it to the top, now it ain't funny, let it marinate, oh
Ain't talkin' money, need a hearing aid, woah
And now I'm top dog, got mob ties since a feathеr weight
I can't get tied down to thе block, I had to separate
Married to the money, I bought champagne and a wedding ring
Got it out the mud, if I hear shots ring, I'ma let it bang
I came from thuggin' on the dark side you would never hang
This Rock 'n' Roll, you hear that sharp cry when that metal sing
Teri ten toes, I heard his mom cry at his sentencing
Pressure, she tremblin', he never said a thing
Take off like airplanes, like slaves, we wear chains
Drive-by, I'm bare-faced, Remmie don't care, chase
Wait 'til it's time, slide with a new Glock and a pair of skates
Lil' bro let shots fly, if they shot by, that's a fair trade
He tried, got knocked by one of my pipes, now he scared straight
Ever since they got by one of my guys, I want their brains
Made it to the top, now it ain't funny, let it marinate, oh
Ain't talkin' money, need a hearing aid, woah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
