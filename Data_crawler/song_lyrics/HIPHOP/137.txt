Song Name: REEL IT IN
Right now
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN (yeah) (hey)
Trippin'
Rollie got the tick tock missin'
Bitch pimpin' (ayy)
Broke niggas got me livin' (wow)
You Jordan or Pippin (true)
I'm Kobe I'm never gon' dish it
Or miss it
I'm dissin' as fuck and I ain't got the time to just kick it
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch, I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like
Reel it in (ayy)
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in (ayy)
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN
Jesus Christ (hallelujah)
I bought that shit before I even know the price (hey)
This 13K up on my finger, bitch, you right (true)
Them diamonds dancin', yeah, that boy be lookin' nice (ayy)
I guess this what you call that motherfucking ice
Got a thotiana, put her in designer
She Italiana, she a sorta kinda
She Bj√∂rk cute
So she really fine, just sorta weird, and she got some cake
She gimme OPB for my ODB
These APC, do your ABC's
I'm a young dread-head with anxiety
And I love it when a bitch nigga tryin' me
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like
Reel it in (ayy)
I got the bag, tell a friend (whoo)
She got some ass, bring it in (ooh)
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend (true)
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
