Song Name: All Falls Down
Oh, when it all (yeah), it all falls down (this the real one baby)
I'm telling you all (uh, Chi-Town stand up), it all falls down
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore three yerrs ain't picked a carerr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh, when it all (uh)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm telling you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down (and when it all falls down)
Oh, when it all
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm telling you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down (and when it all falls down)
Oh, when it all
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollering, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all (yeah, come on, come on)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm telling you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down (and when it all falls down)
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
Oh, when it all (Chi-Town Chi-Town)
It all falls down (we gon show 'em how we get down)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down
Us can't keep working like this, this graveshift, it's like a slaveship
