Song Name: Sprinkle
Damn, Ryder
Damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars, old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (brrd)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like seashells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email
Oh, now you wanna see me?
Ridin' round late night with a star like LAPD
Big flights, ain't even left the home, McGee
Everything we do be in 3D (brrd)
I want Vlone, six hoes, no phones
Sleepin' with that chrome, I ain't lackin', never
Big FN tucked in my Gucci sweater
Ayy, get the fuck off my dick though
Truth be told, we was the first ones on Rick though
Uh, heard what you said, you not slick, hoe
Not Big Bank, but we'll make this a shit show
Boom, damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars, old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (brrd)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like seashells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email
