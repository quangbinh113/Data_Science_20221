Song Name: V12 (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)
I'm in first, never last, never in reverse (never in reverse)
It's a Thursday when I be drippin' down in Ricky O'
Like Uzi Vert said that money stretching longer to the door (to the door)
It's a cold play, when you get left right there, I said I'm gone
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Love to be around her, she a flirt
I'ma get up in it, yeah-yeah
Lift them butterfly doors when I get you, yeah-yeah
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Don't forget that I'm the one who did it first
Put you in some Prada, yeah-yeah
I'ma hit her with that V12 stroke, yeah-yeah
Drop it low (oh-woah), Aventador (yeah-yeah)
I could put you on the things that you ain't seen before
I'm lookin' like a pot of gold, uh, wheels on Forgio's (uh-huh)
It goes zero to a hundred when I hit the floor (ooh)
I might hit a few times, but I can't keep her close
That's a number ten on me, keep the baddest hoes (baddest hoes)
Tap in, baby, go in, put in work (put in work)
When you walkin' in that Birkin, don't forget who did it first
I'm in first, never last, never in reverse (in reverse)
It's a Thursday when I be drippin' down in Ricky O'
Like Uzi Vert said that money stretching longer to the door
It's a cold play, when you get left right there, I said I'm gone
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Love to be around her, she a flirt
I'ma get up in it, yeah-yeah
Lift them butterfly doors when I get you, yeah-yeah
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Don't forget that I'm the one who did it first
Put you in some Prada, yeah-yeah
I'ma hit her with that V12 stroke, yeah-yeah
Haha, hot, don't forget who did this shit first, yeah-yeah (yeah)
I'ma be this way 'til in a hearse, yeah-yeah (yeah)
And I don't care if your own feelings hurt, yeah-yeah
'Cause I know I'm the one that did it first, yeah-yeah (woah)
Put you on that jet, bought you a purse, yeah-yeah (yes)
I ain't mean to flex, just like to splurge, yeah-yeah (I'm sorry)
I know you still love me, just on my worse, yeah-yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)
Girl, you look so good, mess up my words, yeah-yeah
See every side, hide behind the curtains
And I love the way you stack them racks inside your Birkin
Ooh, I be swaggin', purpose, surfin'
I ain't never trust nobody, treat you like my first friend (Lil Uzi)
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Love to be around her, she a flirt
I'ma get up in it, yeah-yeah
Lift them butterfly doors when I get you, yeah-yeah
She said I'm reckless
Diamonds in my smile and my necklace
Don't forget that I'm the one who did it first
Put you in some Prada, yeah-yeah
I'ma hit her with that V12 stroke, yeah-yeah
