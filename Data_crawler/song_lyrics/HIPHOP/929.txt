Song Name: Outside (Better Days)
Yeah, yeah
They scared to come outside
Tell them boys they better pray
Tell them boys stay out the way
Tell them ain't nobody safe
For my mama, on my gang
We gon' put it in they face, yeah
They scared to come outside
Niggas know we stepping night and day
Niggas know we stepping now and later
Until it hurts, there ain't no mercy, that's just how we made
You hear that church up in my verses
'Cause that's just how we raised
Fuck 'em, I'ma murk 'em, God said, "Ain't nobody perfect"
Lost my little brother, I been tryna hide the hurt
Push up on the other side and put 'em all on shirts
(I clean this blood off my Jesus piece)
Jesus, please say there's a Heaven for a real one
I had to smoke 'em, even Moses had to kill one
Do it for the bills, I swear this shit is getting ill
They scared to come outside
Niggas know we stepping night and day
Niggas know we stepping now and later
Until it hurts, there ain't no mercy, that's just how we made
You hear that church up in my verses
'Cause that's just how we raised
I ain't pray for these baguettes, I pray for better days (better days)
I ain't pray for that new 'Vette, I'd rather have my dawgs back
Lord, protect me with this TEC, I ain't pray for this Patek
Remember the day I got the text, "Another fatherless child"
Can't act right, 'cause they left him fatherless
No hood harder than fatherhood
Who gon' teach your son to go farther than father did?
All these kids raising all these kids
Push to start up my starter kit
Another fatherless child influenced by the crowd
I'm a victim of the system, but I'm a suspect to the victim
I'm in church with a loaded weapon, I can't even trust the reverend
I'm praying with my eyes open, hoping I don't catch the COVID
19 bullets in a .40
You not from 'round where I'm 'round
Boss up or get bossed around
They see I'm with the top down, would you look at me now?
If you ain't come see me then, why would you come see me now?
They scared to come outside
Niggas know we stepping night and day
Niggas know we stepping now and later
Until It hurts, there ain't no mercy, that's just how we made
You hear that church up in my verses
'Cause that's just how we raised
