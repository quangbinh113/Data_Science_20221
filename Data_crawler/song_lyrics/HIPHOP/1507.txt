Song Name: STAYING ALIVE (feat. Drake & Lil Baby)
Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die
(Real life!)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
(Another one) yeah
Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die (DJ Khaled)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
How she in love and she been over once?
It's not like I known her for months
This life allowed me to take what I want
It's not like I know what I want
It's not like I know what I need
I get some time, but it's no guarantees
When I was broke, she was being a tease
Four pockets full, now she down on her knees
Whoa, whoa, whoa-ooh-whoa
Baby gon' hit it and send her to me, yeah
Or I'ma hit it and send it to Baby
That's how I give it, this life get too crazy
Whoa, whoa, for real, for real, whoa
They tryna seal the deal, see me up under the sheet
Parading the streets, yeah
Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
Yeah
Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive, for real (oh, yeah)
For real, for real
I put my feelings aside, you want me to die? But baby, I'm staying alive
'Posed to be one of a kind, you putting no miles, I thought you was down for the ride
I'm tryna turn up her style, we going Chanel, she get everything in her size
She in some shit with another guy, I don't even care, whenever I see you, you mine
Drizzy hit her and he send her to me, I don't talk, definition of P
Hood nigga turned superstar, but I fuck her good like I'm still in the streets
No response, you can see that I read it
I'm with all, they won't ever go read it
She be happy if I fell off, and I'm still there
They're gonna have to accept it
Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive

Try me a hundred times
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive
I'm staying alive, I'm staying alive, for real

For real, for real (for real, for real)
