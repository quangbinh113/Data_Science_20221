Song Name: PUFFIN ON ZOOTIEZ
G5 the flight, man, I'm way in the sky
She finna tell me "No way" and it's cap
N-, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
G5 the flight, n- way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here
G5 the flight, n-, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
B- so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffiin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on sh-, turn it up and not gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a b-, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure sh- good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewer
Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these n-, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this sh-
B- break her neck just to look at the kid
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these n-
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot 30 M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I keep me a fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her a-, she gon' think she Korean
You f- me good, b-, you helpin' me win
N- can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, I think I'ma quit
I pop the E, I can feel when it kick
G5 the flight, n-, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
B- so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffiin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on sh-, turn it up and not gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a b-, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure sh- good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewer
Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these n-, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this sh-
B- break her neck just to look at the kid
Count up some millions and take some more drugs
Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love
Ain't matching my fly, b-, you know you a dub
I started this wave, and now use it as a brush
Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no f- n- holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' n- whack
After I hit your b-, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt
Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat
Took a few sh-, I forget where I'm at
Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick
G5 the flight, n-, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
B- so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffiin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on sh-, turn it up and not gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a b-, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure sh- good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewer
Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these n-, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this sh-
B- break her neck just to look at the kid
