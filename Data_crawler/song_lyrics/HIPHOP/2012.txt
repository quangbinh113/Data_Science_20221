She looks like a movie star (what the deal, what the deal?)
Like a chocolate candi bar (tell me how you feel, how you feel)
She looks like a movie star (what the deal, what the deal?)
Like a chocolate candi bar (tell me how you feel, how you feel)
She looks like a movie star (what the deal, what the deal?)
Like a chocolate candi bar (yeah, how you feel, how you feel)

Hiya love love, you little fly lady bug
Come and swing this episode with more from up above
With them Earl Jeans on fitting tight like a glove
You little Cinammon Toast Crunch, come show me some love (mwah!)
Slim goodie got tittle litties
Yeah, but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty
You're provoking me, giving me the notions
To make me wanna lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this?
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candi bar)
Yeah, that describes her
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar

I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Her style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said, "I take you just the way you are"
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes, you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a-
Oh yeah, the time is now and the place is here
So come a little closer, let me kick it in your ear
And share this with you girl, you super official girl
I just wanna bite you, you look good like a Snickers
Ooh la la, ah wee wee
Walking by looking all like I esctasy
Got dough, ma didn't know, good gracious alive
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo, come and rest your feet, my little chocolate souffl√©
I know you're tired, you been running through my mind all day
And oh my goodness, can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted
Lord have mercy, please give me strength
Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake
Just thinking of your shape girl, I catch a toothache
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candi bar
She looks like a-
We just buggin' out a little bit
Showing versatility
Yeah
She looks like a-
