Song Name: Captain Hook
Real Hot Girl shit, ah
(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)
Ayy, bitch, I'm a problem nobody solvin'
You can keep hating, I'm poppin' regardless
He want a bi' look like Megan Thee Stallion (yeah)
Don't want your nigga 'cause I want his daddy
I like to switch up my style every week
I gotta switch up my hair every day
I ain't no ho, but I do be on go
And I promise my nigga's gon' love me the same
I'm a Hot Girl, don't try it at home
I wear the shit that be showing my thong
I like to drink and I like to have sex
I fuck the niggas that's cutting the checks
Dance on the dick, now, you been served
I like a dick with a little bit of curve
Hit this pussy with an uppercut
Call that nigga Captain Hook
Ayy, I go shopping, mmh, want it, then I cop it, ayy, yeah
Bitches boppin', mmh, I do it, they copy, ayy, look
He's a sweetie, mmh, kiss it when he eat it, ayy, yeah
Know it's good when you chewin' and you singin' (ay, ay)
I love niggas with conversation that find the clit with no navigation
Mandatory that I get the head, but no guarantees on the penetration (huh)
I be texting with a bi chick, we both freaky, just trying shit (mwah)
Main nigga getting super jealous, he don't even know about the other fellas
I need a Mr. Clean, make that pussy beam (ooh, ooh)
Okay, I just might need a baker, make that pussy cream (pussy cream)
Okay, you woke up mad at me 'fore you even brush your teeth
Mm-mm-mm, that's just super sad, fuck it, carpe diem, ah
I'm so indecisive, you can't cuff me, but I'm wifey (but I'm wifey)
I just want a nigga who gon' slurp me like an Icee (slurp me like an Icee)
Bitches bite me so hard, had to put them on a diet (put them on a diet)
Bitch, this ain't no tryout, so lil' ho, you better not try me (ho, you better not try me)
I got a man, I got a bitch
I'm a banana, they gotta split (hey, hey, ah)
One in your top, one in your tip (hey, hey)
One for the club, one for the crib (one for the crib)
My nigga fine, I wanna fuck
Ice in his mouth, eat me up
Rockin' his chain, wearin' his ring
Gettin' some brain, ah, ah, ah
Ayy, I go shopping, mmh, want it, then I cop it, ayy, yeah
Bitches boppin', mmh, I do it, they copy, ayy, look
He's a sweetie, mmh, kiss it when he eat it, ayy, yeah
Know it's good when you chewin' and you singin'
