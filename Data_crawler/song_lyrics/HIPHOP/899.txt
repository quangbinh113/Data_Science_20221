Carti' my body, I'm chosen (chosen)
Now I got her wide open (wide open)
She off the Perky, she (rollin') (she wildin')
And she ride for the gang (gang)
She know that I'm (rollin') (she know it)
Pledge my allegiance to the five (to the fever)
All my niggas down to ride (down to ride)
Play with mines, you know we up the .9
Yeah, we into murder, homicide (murder)
All my niggas really built for war (built for war)
You take one of mine, we take five of yours (that's a fact)
And we come in knockin' at your door (at your door)
Kickin' it down, send you to the Lord
Don Dusty controllin' (controllin')
Picture me (rollin')

And she ride for the gang (gang)
She know that I'm (rollin') (she know it)
Now we back on the fever (that's the HQ)
Gotta walk with my nina (with my nina)

Say she love me, I do not believe her (holy shit!)

Cold world, keep a heater (keep a heater)

Check my temperature, always nine-five degrees (nine-five degrees)
Walkin' with the cannon that's on me
Turn him into a duppy, lay deceased

Talkin' like you tough, then you gotta die (you gotta)
