DJ Khaled
They say my time is almost up, tell them bitches, "Wish, wish"
All these hoes lookin' cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit, lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a ho 'cause I be tempted
Now I be countin' money, buyin' jewelry, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
I just make my M's and mind my business, hoes be ridin' dick (Dick)
"I can see Cardi eat so much," and that's what got 'em sick
But I wonder how they still ain't pregnant, all that riding dick
Y'all betta go ahead with that weak
S hit, I'm certified, real street bitch
Won't be a song if I leak shit, we strapped up like defense
Whatever you do, sis, keep it cute, sis
Leave that beefin' shit at Ruth Chris or end up toothless
I've been official my whole life,
I bought burners, I ain't buy lights (Brr)
How did little ol' me get money? Got everybody all tight
These bitches wack,
These bitches garb (Garb), they diss me, I disregard
Bet you if I had a dick, these bitches couldn't get it hard
They say my time is almost up, tell them bitches, "Wish, wish" (Wish)
All these hoes lookin' cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit, lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a ho 'cause I be tempted (Blaow)
Bought a Richard Mille, coulda bought me a house (No joke)
Feel like I'm the greatest rapper came out the South (Who want smoke?)
She keep tryin' to fuck, I told her top me for now (On God)
She got ass shots, told her work on her mouth (Straight up)
Everybody talkin' this king talk,
Nigga we shootin' shit up, we don't battle (Bitch)
Cornball nigga,
You ain't gettin' no money and we don't
Give a fuck about your talents (Snitch)
Came from the bottom,
I'm a multimillionaire, I was just sleeping on pallets (21)
Fuck these rappers, I'm 4L gang,
We the best like DJ Khaled (Straight up)
Your bitch got that crazy head like a Kanye tweet (21)
Had a wedding for my Glocks, call 'em Jay and Bey (21)
I split the rent with my chopper 'cause it stay with me (On God)
Leave you drunk like a shot of liquor, ain't no chasin' me (On God)
He threw in a white flag, but I still want beef (Stupid)
Catch you at your album release you play with Cardi B (Shoot it)
Make this pistol blow both ways, I call it Hennessy
I know your mama taught you look
Both ways 'fore crossing me (Lil' bitch)
They say my time is almost up, tell them bitches, "Wish, wish"
All these hoes lookin' cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit, lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a ho 'cause I be tempted (Blaow)
We The Best music
(What's that on your wrist?)
(I call it a chandelier)
Another one
