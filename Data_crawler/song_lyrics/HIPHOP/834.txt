Song Name: Like Home
Yeah, woo, yeah
Got a Draco in the closet (yeah)
With a wood grain handle
I'm around you in every countries (yeah)
Nigga play again, it's mantle
Run it up now, ooh
Give a damn, we 'on't care what a nigga think
(Yeah, yeah)
Run it up now, ooh
Give a damn, I'ma take this money to the bank
(Yeah, yeah)
I've been all around the world (yeah)
But the trap still, trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said the trap still feel like home
Reppin' on the road, said he doin' shows (yeah)
Didn't see that, I pray for her I know but-
Trappin' with my bros, trappin' with bros
All I know, it's the way we have growed up (yeah)
Lookin' at my mint like, "What? It's cold"
Lookin' at my wrist, that pussy mad 'cause he froze up (yeah)
Pull up in that Lamborghini, throw the doors up
Nigga want some smoke, wait hold up
We can not wait to show up
I might be the one who got him rockin' like a boulder
Fuck 'em, when I'm on a Perc', won't touch 'em when I'm sober
Put him in your armor shirt, won't put him on a poster
Glizzy in my pocket, I can't rock it, ain't no hoes here (yeah)
Knew my flow was sick, they know it would give 'em pneumonia
Know that I be drippin', and know that I keep it on
Draco in the closet, them motherfuckers so rude (yeah)
Sippin' post, I said the trap still feel like home
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said the trap still feel like home
Thousand miles away, I be gone
I got rich and famous, I'm high, I still pick up the phone
But I wasn't down the road, yeah free the fuckin' bros, yeah
I can change these hoes out, like I change my clothes now
I can't nod my heads at my lil' dogs, it make them go out
Stop posting my pictures of my drip, they won't have no style
Hundid thousand in my pocket, half nappin', know I give profile
Niggas think I'm sweet, try to lick me and it's gon' go south
Never try to diss you or bash you, move on with no problems
One thing that I know, once your dollars up, they goin' hard swallow
They out, feel like slime on the road, someone go get my driver
Crying when you might not come home, that's what I call silent
Fuck around and found me a plug, and vinced him in exotics
Never goin' back to my hood, 'cause I ain't gon' leave a body
Make sure that my people, them good, that's what I care about
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said the trap still feel like home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said the trap still feel like home
