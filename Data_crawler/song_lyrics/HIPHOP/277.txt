Song Name: Evolved (feat. Roddy Ricch)
It's crazy what you see a nigga do when you get the bag
Remy
When you chasing your own bag
These niggas be switching up for real
I thought you was my dawg for sure
Ever since I got money, my day one niggas ain't even tryna call me no more
Thought we was gon' ball for sure
Every since I done evolved, I done seen all these niggas change
'Cause I got a couple chains and my pockets got change
I was back at the trap, now they callin' my name
I done been through the rain, now I'm pushing Mulsanne (Skrrt skrrt)
We was serving 8-balls, now I rock Balmain
I was broke as a bitch, now I thumb through them thangs (Oh yeah)
I can't never let these pussy niggas snake me
So I keep a chopper on deck and it's off safety
Nigga, you was 'posed to be my dawg, we was on the same team
And now it's fuck you, now I don't trust at all, could you blame me?
Got my back to the wall, ain't trusting these hoes
Gave that lil' bitch my heart, she ain't stick to the code
Locked up in that jail, man, it turned my heart cold
When I found out my main bitch was fuckin' my bro
I was whipping that work straight up out the bowl
I wasn't making no profit though
And them bitches ain't want me 'cause I was broke
Now they on dick 'cause my pockets swole
And some of my day ones, they be hatin' on me 'cause I'm popping now
Yeah, they act like we gang but then be throwin' dirt on my name when I'm not around
I peeped the vibes, it's all in your eyes, can see that you plottin' now
Damn, my nigga, why you hate me?
I should've known you would snake me
I thought you was my dawg for sure
Ever since I got money, my day one niggas ain't even tryna call me no more
Thought we was gon' ball for sure
Every since I done evolved, I done seen all these niggas change
'Cause I got a couple chains and my pockets got change
I was back at the trap, now they callin' my name
I done been through the rain, now I'm pushing Mulsanne (Skrrt skrrt)
We was serving 8-balls, now I rock Balmain
I was broke as a bitch, now I thumb through them thangs
I can't never let these pussy niggas snake me
Especially when you on top of that trap, these niggas gon' hate me
Went to the prison and my main bitch didn't even wait for me
Nigga, I can't trust nobody, stay away from me
All these fake niggas, gotta cut the grass on these snake niggas
I was down bad, I was starving, I ain't had nothin' in my plate, nigga
I ain't even had no choice, jumped off the porch when I was 8, nigga
Hustling every night, a nigga damn near caught a case, nigga
A lot of niggas hated on me (They hated on me)
I just stayed down for myself
Now I'm running through the city
Got a pocket full of faces on me (Pocket full of faces on me)
And I remember seeing these niggas changing on me
That shit amazing to me
I thought you was my dawg for sure
Ever since I got money, my day one niggas ain't even tryna call me no more
Thought we was gon' ball for sure
Every since I done evolved, I done seen all these niggas change
'Cause I got a couple chains and my pockets got change
I was back at the trap, now they callin' my name
I done been through the rain, now I'm pushing Mulsanne (Skrrt skrrt)
We was serving 8-balls, now I rock Balmain
I was broke as a bitch, now I thumb through them thangs
Yeah, shit get real when you out here, man

You can't even trust your motherfuckin' family, nigga
Remy
You can't even trust your motherfuckin', your blood brothers, niggas
Them motherfuckin', your blood cousins, they'll turn on you so quick
