Song Name: Who Needs Love
Yeah
Fuck your love, fuck it, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
Fuck your trust, fuck it (Fuck your trust, no), I don't want none of it, no (Yeah)
Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, ho
Yeah (Don't need your love, don't need your love)
Yeah, but who needs love? (Love)
That ain't never changed shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed, bitch (Yeah)
I been rollin' 'round with the same clique
I been rollin' 'round with the gang, bitch (Gang, bitch)
Fuck your squad and who you came with
In a foreign car, I'm switchin' lanes quick
And I'm destined for this fucking greatness, ayy (Yeah)
And I don't got time for a bitch (No, no, I don't)
That's gon' slow a nigga like me down (Yeah, yeah, no, no, I don't)
'Cause I keep on speed racin' to the motherfucking cash, nigga
I'm a fuckin' cash cow, oh
Stuntin' like my motherfucking daddy, bitch (Like my dad, yeah)
Spent a hunnid on a ring and a Patek wrist (On a Patek wrist, yeah)
And the choppa on my hip is automatic, bitch (Automatic, bitch, yeah)
Get the brrah, get the blastin' shit (Bah), yeah
Don't fuck with me, don't say that (Don't say that)
That bullshit, shawty, save that (Save that)
I knew shawty since way back
Way back when I was eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Feastin' it up, feastin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Livin' it up, livin' it up, ayy
We did it, yeah, we did it, yeah, ayy (Yeah, yeah)
Still the same though (Yeah), still the same ho (Okay), yeah
Fuck your love, fuck it, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
Fuck your trust, fuck it (Fuck your trust, no), I don't want none of it, no (Yeah)
Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, ho
Yeah (Don't need your love, don't need your love)
Yeah, but who needs love? (Love)
That ain't never changed shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed, bitch (Yeah)
I been rollin' 'round with the same clique
I been rollin' 'round with the gang, bitch
Fuck your squad and who you came with
In a foreign car, I'm switchin' lanes quick
And I'm destined for this fucking greatness, ayy (Yeah)
