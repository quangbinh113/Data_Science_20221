Song Name: Camelot
Yeah
FreshDuzit
Yeah
Huh, huh, huh
I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shots
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil' nigga you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas
My niggas trappin' out the bando, shoutout to the Migos (The Migos)
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole
The trap always open, bitch, we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos
Step one, step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hunnid some' drums like a band in this bitch
Man, she keep on bitchin', all that naggin' and shit
Hoe shut the fuck up and jus' gag on this dick
I'm a side nigga, and I love when she swallow
If a nigga say something, hit him wit' a hollow
That glizzy, knock ya meat out ya taco (Your taco)
Flexin' on these bitches, they call me Johnny Bravo
School of hard knocks, let me take you to class
My bitch is real skinny but she got a lot of ass
I love counting money, I get a lot of cash
If you try to take it from me, his toe gon' have a tag
I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, bitch, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shots
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil' nigga you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas
All up in the party, you know we keep them carbines (Them Carbines)
Bring a nigga chills like I work at Baskin-Robbins (Robbins)
I love Batman, but a young nigga robbin'
Firework show, 'cause my niggas get to sparklin'
I'm a hothead, I'll crash any second (Yeah)
He speakin' on who? Send his bitch ass to heaven (To heaven)
Extended clips, when we tote them MAC-11's (Uh-huh)
My niggas they be crippin', they be screamin' out them 7's (Crip)
Why you investigating me? 'Cause I don't know a thang
And I'ma always keep a solid, I'll never sang
You know I'm Shotta Fam, I always rep the gang (Shotta)
He kept on dissin' so a nigga had to snatch his brain (Gang, gang)
Had to snatch his brain (Had to snatch that nigga brain)
I had to snatch his brain (Had to snatch that nigga brain)
I had to make it rain (Make that motha fucka rain)
R. Kelly let that fuckin' choppa sing, yeah (Make it sing)
