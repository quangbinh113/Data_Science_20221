Song Name: No Stylist (feat. Drake)
Ooh
Yeah, louder
Hey, hey
I'm in London, got my beat from London
Iced out (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (Huh, haan)
Lifestyle (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (Haan)
Diamonds on my neck, causing tears (Tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lears (Lear)
Bad bitches gettin' wet, here
Yeah, don't call me 'til the checks clear (Clear)
(Louder)
Fuck they talkin' about?
Fast talk, runnin' laps
Now I'm not playin' that shit
French Vanilla sippin' on
Lear jets pickin' up
Home call, Morocco, I'm here
No stylist
And I ain't playin' with these bitches, they childish (Haan)
Yeah, look around, they quiet
She said I ain't got no heart, bitch, find it
Iced out (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (Huh, haan)
Lifestyle (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (Haan)
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears (Tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lears (Lear)
Bad bitches gettin' wet, here
Yes, don't call me 'til the checks clear (Clear)
(Louder)
I got the game in a squeeze
Who disagree? I wanna see one of y'all run up a B
Yeah, two open seats, we flyin' at seven and packed for the beach
Yeah, keepin' it G, I told her "don't wear no 350s 'round me"
Iced out, no stylist
No Chanel, Nike track, doin' road with some waps
And that's Capo in the back, and that's swole in the back
Don't need Gucci on my back, TV Gucci got my back
Don't know where y'all niggas at, I've been here, I've been back
In Delilah, word to Zack, I need action, that's a fact
Iced out (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (Huh, haan)
Lifestyle (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (Haan)
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears (Tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lears (Lear)
Bad bitches gettin' wet, here
Yeah, don't call me 'til the checks clear (Clear)
Iced out (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (Huh, haan)
Lifestyle (Stylist), no stylist (Stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (Haan)
No stylist

No stylist
