Song Name: Have Mercy
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Booty so big (work!) Lord, have mercy (work!)
Why I keep bossing like I do?
Why I keep flossing like I do?
Why I keep saucing like I do?
Why it keep costing like it do?
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things (Lord, have mercy, work!)
Boy, you looking at me like I ain't give you no choice
If I count to three, bet you be on your knees
You wrapped 'round my hand like a Cartier, oh-oh
You can't get this thickness out of your mind
He say he like that Laffy Taffy
He so goofy, call me daddy
He go stupid, he go daffy
Introduce me to his pappy
He can never live without me
I'm so real, I'm never capping
If he got it like that, like that
I can take it, take it there
'Cause my
Booty so big (work!) Lord, have mercy (work!)
Why I keep bossing like I do? (Boss)
Why I keep flossing like I do? (Floss)
Why I keep saucing like I do? (Sauce)
Why it keep costing like it do? (Cost)
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things (Lord, have mercy, work!)
Why I keep bossing like I do? (Boss)
Why I keep flossing like I do? (Floss)
Why I keep saucing like I do? (Sauce)
Why it keep costing like it do? (Cost)
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things (like...)
How to surf it, man, how to work it, man
It's on purpose, I'm doing it big
Body language, like speaking Spanglish
I'll educate ya how to do this shit
Temporary, that's never rare-y
I'm necessary, yeah, I am that bitch
You can't get this thickness out of your mind
He say he like that Laffy Taffy
He so goofy, call me daddy
He go stupid, he go daffy
Introduce me to his pappy
He can never live without me
I'm so real, I'm never capping
If he got it like that, like that
I can take it, take it there
'Cause my
Booty so big (work!) Lord, have mercy (work!)
Why I keep bossing like I do? (I do)
Why I keep flossing like I do? (I do)
Why I keep saucing like I do?
Why it keep costing like it do?
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things
Why I keep bossing like I do? (Boss) (I do)
Why I keep flossing like I do? (Floss) (I do)
Why I keep saucing like I do? (Sauce)
Why it keep costing like it do? (Cost)
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things
