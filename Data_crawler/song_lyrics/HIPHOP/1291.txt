Song Name: Do We Have A Problem?
I just told P, "This really niggas' worst nightmare, man
They don't wanna see Lil Baby with the Barbie" (Papi Yerr, Yerr)
Tell 'em my niña, my bitch, she a rider
I got a shooter, and I got a driver
They want that heat, I'm the only provider
Little bad foreign bitch, word to Fivio
Niggas know the vibe, that's word to Five, yo
Beef, we 'bout to resolve, yo
Pull up on an opp, do we have a problem? (Hmm)
Hold up, shorty, hold up, bitch
Please, don't touch me, look at my fit
Look at my ankle, look at my wrist
This one a pack, this one a brick
That one an opp, that one a lick
This one for Pop, this one for Juice
I am the one, bitch, you a deuce, brr
Niggas give it up in my city
Really shed blood in my city, real love in my city
Niggas'll son your whole set like it's a round six
Clips, whole team get flyer than round trips, bitch
She's still spying on my flicks (flicks), he admiring my drip (drip)
Check what I do, the check'll clear too
Pull up like a drive-thru, so check your rearview
I'on care how long it take to get a opp back
All my niggas outside, steak, bitch, we out back (out back)
I'on care how long it take to get a (opp back)
All my niggas (outside), steak, bitch, we (out back)
Brr!
Tell 'em my niña, my bitch, she a rider
I got a shooter and I got a driver
They want that heat, I'm the only provider
Little bad foreign bitch, word to Fivio
Niggas know the vibe, that's word to Five, yo
Beef, we 'bout to resolve, yo
Pull up on an opp, do we have a problem? (Ayy-yo, Baby, let's go)
2022, I'm coming through on that new shit (oop)
How we opps? You see me, and you don't do shit (brr)
I done really trapped in the Carter, I got the blueprint
Gallery Department, we shopping, I like the loose fit
What's the point of having this muscle if you don't use it?
I play the game to win, I'm not losing
Opps know my address, I'm not moving
Brodie know to take it to trial, they gotta prove it
She gets what she wants when we screwing
I'm on point, I know what I'm doing
Way too smart to act like I'm stupid
I get my advice from Mike Rubin
I'm not by myself, my whole crew lit
Next year Chanel, I put her in that new print
It is what it is, I can't make no excuses
I hit the whole group, do that make me a groupie?
Balenciaga coat, this is not Gucci
We went city to city in bulletproofs
You can't run with my gang, they'll bully you
Been had switches, I know what them fullies do
I'm a vibe, let me know what you wanna do
Ain't no fun by yourself, bring a friend or two
We be ménaging, that boost up his ego
She a lil' demon off that Casamigos
Yeah, Baby
Tell 'em my niña, my bitch, she a rider
I got a shooter, and I got a driver
They want that heat, I'm the only provider
Little bad foreign bitch, word to Fivio
Niggas know the vibe, that's word to Five, yo
Beef, we 'bout to resolve, yo
Pull up on an opp, do we have a problem?
There's no autotune on me, is there? (Nope)
Don't mean the rapper when I say bitches ride the wave
Flooded my watch, but ain't giving a clown the time of day
Ain't talking Christmas, wouldn't holla in my holidays
I fuck with niggas that be shooting at they opps for days
Trust me (trust me), they gon' let me know (know)
They gon' rep' me when they catch you lacking, that .45 special flow (flow)
They gon' wet you, yo (yo)
Yes, I'm always good for the bag
Niggas gon' hop out on that ass, ski mask
Heavy on the ski mask too
And the ski mask ain't for the pandemi'
It go with the semi, paid a pretty damn penny
Ski mask way!
