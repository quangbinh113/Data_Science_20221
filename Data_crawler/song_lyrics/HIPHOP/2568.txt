Song Name: Good Wine
Back to the basics been a lot of things but I never been, basic
Ran around bases came from the basement never been, shameless
So copped stainless streets get dangerous so I might, bang it
Don't like hanging unless you family please don't, claim me
Like what you claiming what you saying what you bout and what you need
I'm at the house ain't at the club I'm really chilling with my seed
I love my pops he put me on I'm really chilling with OG's
Don't test my gangsta think I'm bitch made we gon' fuck around and see
Tryna be here for a while and a good time
Where we ain't stressed out just good wine
When I look in the mirror yeah I look fine
Good people, times, and good vibes (good wine, good wine, good wine)
(Put your motherfuck' cups up, Put your motherfuck' cups up)
Tryna be here for a while and a good time
Where we ain't stressed out just good wine
When I look in the mirror yeah I look fine
Good people, times, and good vibes (good wine, good wine, good wine)
(Put your motherfuck' cups up, Put your motherfuck' cups up)
Streets get ugly yeah I seen it please believe me I'll be tucked
Don't like smoking last too long so I'll keep sipping on this cup
Don't crave attention just to mention I'll be chilling in the cut
Glass got empty now I'm searching through my wallet for a buck
Dollar bill and some change in my pocket oh no
Hit my girl can you spot me I just need a little loan
Out the house and I'm just Vibing Vibing Vibing on the low
She said she on her way plus she just wanna ride ride it till it grow
Tryna be here for a while and a good time
Where we ain't stressed out just good wine
When I look in the mirror yeah I look fine
Good people, times, and good vibes (good wine, good wine, good wine)
(Put your motherfuck' cups up, Put your motherfuck' cups up)
Tryna be here for a while and a good time
Where we ain't stressed out just good wine
When I look in the mirror yeah I look fine
Good people, times, and good vibes (good wine, good wine, good wine)
(Put your motherfuck' cups up, Put your motherfuck' cups up)
