Song Name: BET
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
I know exactly how all of this goes
Too real for the cameras, I don't like to pose
When I go out, a few weeks on the road
One million, two million, three million, four
Think that I'm stoppin'? You got me confused a 'lil bit
Who are you to say shit to me? (Quiet)
You seen that slope, it gets slippery (you seen it)
Y'all type of rich isn't rich to me (at all)
Elevatin' daily, baby
I ain't scared of heights no more
God be sayin', "Russ, I got it
You don't gotta fight no more"
Okay (okay), okay (okay), okay (okay)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
I needed a break so I took one, that's healthy
My spirit was broke (broke), my pockets were wealthy
Was drownin' from bein' an anchor for everyone
But I can't help you (I can't), if I don't help me (yeah)
So give me a second to breathe (breathe)
Give me a second to breathe (breathe)
Time is just flyin', at least I'm in the pilot
Can everyone stay in their seat?
Elevatin' daily, baby
I ain't scared of heights no more
God be sayin', "Russ, I got it
You don't gotta fight no more"
Okay (okay), okay (okay), okay (okay)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
Bet, bet, bet, bet
