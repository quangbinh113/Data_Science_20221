Song Name: Ransom (with Juice WRLD) - Remix
(Turn you to a dancer)
Yeah
(Internet Money, bitch)
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want a song
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna lick the gang, yeah
I got red, I got blue, what you want?
The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I ain't belong
I needed me a dier outta alley me to want
I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
I know they want my downfall, lil' nigga, are you laced?
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they say they want a song
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna lick the gang, yeah
I'm in it to win it, I'ma be the best, yes, sir
Started from the bottom, I ain't have no one, yes, sir
Had to get big on them niggas, Bruce Banner
Bro split wigs, turn a nigga to a dancer
I got hard, I got soft, what you want?
Since the day that I've been on, they been blowing up my phone
I can't hear 'em, I got all this loud in my lungs
Thumbin' through these blue faces while I'm smoking on Runtz
Uh, I'm in the hills (ooh, yeah), countin' them bills (ooh, yeah)
All baguette diamonds (ooh, yeah), chandelier give her chills (yeah)
Feel like yesterday I was just watching Fresh Prince (uh)
Now the crib look like Bel-Air, rip to Uncle Phil
Money big, Uncle Phil, twin Glocks, Phil and Lil
Niggas hate, Uncle Tom, spin them off me, carousel
Get 'em off me, go to hell, silencer, kill 'em soft
Tecca'll take you for ransom, me, I'll put you in a coffin
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they say they want a song
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna lick the gang, yeah
