Song Name: FAR (feat. Young Thug)
Run that back, Turbo
I know they ain't think we'd make it far (Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
We done bought a hundred cars
We done fucked a hundred broads
Went against the odds (Against the odds)
Whole life, was trippin' hard, now we livin' large (Livin' large)
The whole world wouldn't have ours, they know who we are
Know they ain't think we'd make it far (Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
Whole lot of hitters died, in the prison throwing riots
Time to free my guys (Time to free my guys)
Cuz smilin' in my face with pain in his eyes (Pain in his eyes)
Hope he get to catch a wave and change over time (Change over time)
1993, the year a star was born (Star was born)
Lot of people know my name, I feel important (Feel important)
Said I'm on a wave, don't know where I'm goin' (Where I'm goin')
On a whole 'nother wave, sayin' words like a poet (Like a poet)
She said, "GunnaWunna, I love the way you stroke it" (Stroke it)
Fly you in and out of town, my lifestyle not boring (Boring)
I can see you bound to drown, but this drip, you cannot force it (Force it)
Ain't no time to lounge around, my son gotta be born rich (Born rich)
I ain't tryna talk you down 'cause I know niggas be hardhead (Hardhead)
Thinkin' how they put my brother in the ground had to pour up more red (More red)
I been doing circles all around the town, speeding in a Corvette
Bitches tryna trap a nigga down, tellin' me to have raw sex
I know they ain't think we'd make it far
(Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
We done bought a hundred cars
We done fucked a hundred broads
Went against the odds (Against the odds)
Whole life, was trippin' hard, now we livin' large (Livin' large)
The whole world wouldn't have ours, they know who we are
Know they ain't think we'd make it far (Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
Whole lot of hitters died, in the prison throwing riots
Time to free my guys (Time to free my guys)
Cuz smilin' in my face with pain in his eyes (Pain in his eyes)
Hope he get to catch a wave and change over time (Change over time)
I don't need no recruit, gang on the way to guard
These pussies tryna pull a gangster card
Fuck 'round and hit your girl in front your son
Spot full of trees, nigga, it's time to hunt
My brother gave a life back, he God's son
Godson, my baby mama hate the fact I'm on
I'm on, now the spots, they come with chaperones
How come before a million I didn't have no one?
Two 40s when I travel and they twins (They twins, twins)
Put a million on a million and get it again (And get it again and again)
I'm a living testimony, but I sin (Living testimony)
Feel like a Narcissist, you can't teach a nigga nothin' (Teach a nigga nothin')
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
I know they ain't think we'd make it far (Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
We done bought a hundred cars
We done fucked a hundred broads
Went against the odds (Against the odds)
Whole life, was trippin' hard, now we livin' large (Livin' large)
The whole world wouldn't have ours, they know who we are
Know they ain't think we'd make it far (Know they ain't think we'd make it far)
Whole lot of hitters died, in the prison throwing riots
Time to free my guys (Time to free my guys)
Cuz smilin' in my face with pain in his eyes (Pain in his eyes)
