Song Name: too easy
Wheezy outta here
It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showing me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back, so she won't think I need it
Made it out the jungle, I ball, ain't got no jumper
Rest in peace to my uncle, never met, but I still love you
Remember that pussy from way back, playing, I pay 'em to pop him
Stayed in the hood where the killers at, made my pillow a chopper
This ain't diamonds you looking at, and we done updated the roster
You can tell it's a rich nigga posture
Young GunWunna, I'm spitting it proper
Trapping at school, I was serving bags, police was searching my locker
Who did your jewelry? It look like brass, one of your bros should've stopped ya
It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showing me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back, so she won't think I need it
I stick dick deep inside her throat where it ain't no more breathing
If I don't post, and I go ghost, it's gon' be for a reason
Just got my reading, now my reason's, I'm booked out the region
This jewelry cold on me, I'm freezing, no way I'm anemic
Pluto, Pluto, two-door, four-door, man, this shit too easy
Yeah, I'm gon' chop a brick like judo, snatch a Lamborghini (chop it up)
I got a different bitch for different places, different seasons (I do)
Bitch ain't playing her position, cutting her off, this shit too easy (super)
I started off smashing R&B stars right at the bando (Future)
I'm having hoes all the way south thinkin' that I abandoned 'em
I'm having pimping in my blood and I can change the climate (Pluto)
I threw the Marni on and took the price up like I designed it (Pluto)
Can't put a Presidential on a bitch 'less she give a nigga a m√©nage ('nage)
That lil' IG bitch ain't shit, fucked her in the car (car)
Fucked 'round with a side piece, pop out that night in double-R (Pluto)
Started talkin' Chinese from all these sticks in the car
It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showing me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back, so she won't think I need it
I stick dick deep inside her throat where it ain't no more breathing
If I don't post, and I go ghost, it's gon' be for a reason
Just got my reading, now my reason's, I'm booked out the region
This jewelry cold on me, I'm freezing, no way I'm anemic
