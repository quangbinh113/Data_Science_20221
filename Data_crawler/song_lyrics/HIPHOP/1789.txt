Song Name: 24's
Ay, Yo, J, Ay, Yo
Gotta grind two-fours, every-day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling', staying asleep
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
Gotta grind two-fours, every-day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling', staying asleep
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliatеd, but I got bro like he got me
Had to grind and wait my turn
I ain't еver had olders to put me on
C-C-Can't wait till I see me a mil'
JBee's been hungry for way too long
And I been thru' so much shit
Can't you tell by the pain that I put in my songs
Bro got beef, then count me in
I'ma turn that shit to a '2v1'
Me and bro like, 'Ace and Mitch'
He ain't ever been gang, but if they ever touch one of his
Then he promised to me that he's taking trips
He got me, like I got him
I been juggin' from day till' night
I can't stop till' my paper flips
And I been verified in rap, way before insta' gave me a tick
Gotta grind two-fours, every-day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling', staying asleep
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
I ain't nuttin' like dem'
I camp in the studio day till' night cah' my grind's intense
I'm one of the hardest, to come out of my city
I swear, I don't care if they take offence
I didn't see me a single soul
Them times, I struggled to make me a pent (That's right)
And it's either with me or not
I can't trust that yute', if he sits on a fence
Lately, I've been focused on getting my bread
I swear I couldn't care what a pagon' says
I ain't ever been affiliated
But I back my bro, I ain't never been wet
I don't need no ice, I still look lit, in a Nike Tech
They been plotting to take me out
But they ain't managed to find me yet
Gotta grind two-fours, every-day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling', staying asleep
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
Gotta grind two-fours, every-day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling', staying asleep
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliatеd, but I got bro like he got me
