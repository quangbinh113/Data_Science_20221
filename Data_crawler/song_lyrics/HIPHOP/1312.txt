Song Name: Bussin
Yeah, my connect just now sent my wrist back, tell these bitches, "Give my drip back"
Strawberry Ferrari, whip that, like to look back when he h-h-h-h-hit that
Ass and thighs, that's where I'm thick at, told his ex, she ain't getting that dick back
I call Baby, "Yo, where that stick at?" (Tell that boy, come get his shit back)
If they act up, we gon' fix that, my new nigga ain't with that chit-chat
You know you ain't getting your bitch back
Yeah, I do it, bitch, I did that, wish a bitch would, I ain't taking my wish back (woo)
This cost half a ticket, plus tax, big ol' Draco for a mishap
It say "Barbie" on my wrist tat', I ain't at the bus stop, but my niggas bust back (bust back)
VVS' bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen!)
We run shit, no question, bad lil' bitch get wet (I'm bussin')
Don't like good boys (I like hustlers)
I don't talk a lot (I got a few questions)
I'm that guy, don't miss your blessings
Life's too short to be 'round here stressin'
Ass so fat, when she walk, dress lift up
Nobody move, but us, it's a stickup (brr)
SF90 sound like it got hiccups
No matter what, when I call (I pick up)
Tell me all the business, I ain't spillin' my teacup
Go to sleep in Paris, waking up in Mykonos
I'ma lil' busy, go shopping 'til I finish
Send me with an AmEx, I don't need a limit
Every bit of 700, this is not a rental
Yellow Lamborghini coupe, this is not a lemon
VVS' bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen!)
I'm tryna ball, I just copped me some hoops
Blonde on my inches, brown on the roots
Candy apple sticky, red bag, not the fruit
Copped me them cute double C's on my boot (ah)
I'ma lil' busy, go shoppin' 'til I finish
Send me with an AmEx, I don't need a limit
Every bit of 700, this is not a rental
Yellow Lamborghini coupe, this is not a lemon
I fuck him like a boss, Dolce Gabbana scarf
Burberry, ask Siri, I don't ever take a loss
Big whips, I like his drip, big stick, a hundred clips
If it's givin' what it's 'posed to, I might put it on the lip (woo)
VVS' bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin'
VVS' bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen!)
