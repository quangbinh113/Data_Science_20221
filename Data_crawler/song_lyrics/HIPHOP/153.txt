Song Name: difference (interlude)
Baby, I just wanna show you things
Girl, I'll be different
Baby, I could buy you wedding rings
Don't care about the distance
Baby, I just wanna show you things
Girl, I'll be different
Baby, I could buy you wedding rings
Give a fuck about the distance
Ooh-ohh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ohh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ohh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ohh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Yeah-aha, let's play it back
