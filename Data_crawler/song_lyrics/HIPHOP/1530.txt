Song Name: Knock Knock
Mm-mm, yo
Hello, it's a Glock, knock knock
Pen-peng ting wanna (peng-ting wanna)
(Andy Broski Beats)
Brah, brah, brah
Hello, it's a Glock, knock knock, who's there? (Baow)
Buddy wanna do shop-shop, who here? (Ay)
What you gonna do? (Ay), stop-stop, who cares?
You ain't gonna shoot that gun, you scared (brah, brah, brah)
Pen-peng ting wanna, uh-huh
Got an African girl that wanna, uh-huh
Even got a Mali that wanna, uh-uh
Even got a Yardie that wanna, uh-huh
Might take my Mali girl to the guri
Or I might get freaky with it in a gaari (yes)
Stepped out of xabsi, back to the lacag
Broski still tryna score (yup), Vardy
You know I got love for my African girls
But I love me a yardie (uh-huh)
And I got one from the States with nyash
She a real bad B like Cardi B (Cardi)
You ain't gonna beat that shit, you're scared
I bet you won't act like that in the flesh
In a field like Sterling, causin' pressure
I went 'round 'dem sides, you know the rest (uh-huh)
I got so much gyal obsessed (facts)
What do you expect? Look at my neck (Uh)
Look at my wrist (uh), look how it lit (uh, mm-mm, yo)
Made another big bag, got niggas depressed
What the fuck have you done? Don't lie
When your brudda get bun, don't cry
Take a look at that- (uh-huh)
Take a look at that bum, oh my
Weapon in a ride 'cause eye for an eye (mm-mm)
Never I brought Ed down to the 9 (brah, brah)
Told KSI he can slide anytime (grrt)
I ain't got time to reply to bitch niggas (aye)
Opps tryna claim they're big hitters (woo)
But they signed six albums for six figures (bruck)
Said she wanna chill with the big boys (aye)
Baby, come chill with rich niggas (brah)
Racks on the crib, let's renovate (aye, aye)
But when I wan' pop mine, it's heavyweight (boom)
Pree all my opp streams all last year (brah, brah, brah)
And my manager made more anyway
Hello, it's a Glock (brah), knock knock, who's there?
Buddy wanna do shop-shop (mm-mm), who here?
What you gonna do? (Yo), stop-stop, who cares?
You ain't gonna shoot that gun, you scared
Pen-peng ting wanna, uh-huh
Got an African girl that wanna, uh-huh
Even got a Mali that wanna, uh-uh
Even got a Yardie that wanna, uh-huh
I got Europeans singin' my tunes (no cap)
I got Asians singin' my tunes (uh-huh)
Even got the opps singin' my tunes
In jail, I had the CM singin' my tunes (yes, yes, yes)
Fill it up with gyal till there's no more room (made a mil')
Made a mil', still, you can get plugged like Fumez
Bad B, she just wanna shake it, bend that back
Let's take that shit to the room (uh-uh-huh)
Heard a man got shot, argh, pele (sorry)
All these streams, now, I'm on telly (mm-mm)
So when I back my shank like eh-eh (eh-eh?)
They're like, "Kilonshele?" (Baow)
I was in JA, Tivoli Gardens
Crocodile teeth with the rifle sounds
Bang so hard, I was shittin' myself (brah, brah)
'Cah I thought he was dead on the ground (brah)
Hello, it's a Glock, knock knock, who's there?
Buddy wanna do shop-shop, who here? (Mm-mm)
What you gonna do? (Yo), stop-stop, who cares?
You ain't gonna shoot that gun, you scared
Pen-peng ting wanna, uh-huh
Got an African girl that wanna, uh-huh
Even got a Mali that wanna, uh-uh
Even got a Yardie that wanna, uh-huh
Hello, it's a Glock, knock knock
Pen-peng ting wanna (mm-mm)
What you gonna do? Stop-stop
Got an African girl that wanna
Pen-peng ting wanna
Got an African girl that wanna
Even got a Mali that wanna
Even got a Yardie that wanna
Hello, it's a Glock, knock knock, who's there?
Buddy wanna do shop-shop (mm-mm), who here?
What you gonna do? (Yo), stop-stop, who cares?
You ain't gonna shoot that gun, you scared (brah, brah, brah, brah)
Pen-peng ting wanna, uh-huh
Got an African girl that wanna, uh-huh
Even got a Mali that wanna, uh-uh
Even got a Yardie that wanna, uh-huh
