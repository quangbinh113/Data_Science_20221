Song Name: TAlk tO Me (with Rich The Kid feat. Lil Wayne) - Remix
Ayo, Tory
I told you we was gon' do the remix
Easy Stevie, easy
Remix baby
Talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (remix)
You's a prissy little missy, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Talk to me baby, talk to me, talk to me
Say it's all for me
Then get on and get off for me
That is all for me
Ain't got no more love to offer me
Watch your tongue for me
How you talk to me, softly
You gon' touch yourself, get off for me
What you want from me?
Got your thoughts running, heart pumpin' and your skull jumping
You gon' fall for me, you gon' cut a b- and brawl for me
Whole bunch of missed calls from me, that's withdrawal, honey
Let that n- give you more money it won't solve nothing
I take you shopping in all countries, buy your dog something
When you go topless in drawers for me, it look like art to me
The way you sound when you talk to me, sound like harmony
Talk to me
Talk to me, baby (talk to me)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (talk to me)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want you to talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Let her go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go (Remix, baby)
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go (Tory Lanez)
Tell the crew, I got money
I'm the one you wanna know (Lil' Tory)
Look, when I drip, you can slip, you know
Yeah, I talk sh-, I'm hella rich, you know
Yellow bone chick and she hella thick, you know
I'm f- 'em superstars, this ain't one of them chicks you know
I got a key right by the brick, I got a chick, her name Christina
Know who to meet when I need a new two-seater, two new divas
Know who to greet when I need a brand weed, it's two new reefers
Know who to see when I need some brand new freaks
It's two new skeezers right there
Pop up on you like, yeah
Buzzing like I'm Lightyear
You ain't see me in a light-year
I pull up and put my d- in side you chick, your nightmare
Got it on my shirt, it might smear
But that mean she cumming, and it's right there, yeah
Talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Let her go, go, go, go (yeah)
Go, go, go, go (what?)
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know
Yeah, yeah
I can make that p- talk back (what?)
I can spoil you wit' these big racks (racks)
She got good head (head) and she eat her cornbread (cornbread)
The Wraith red, Ben Frank, my friends dead (yeah)
I don't wanna miss it, all of the money, I don't wanna kiss you
The pussy official, I f- her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that p- biting
I tell her to talk to me (talk to me)
The plug gon' walk with me (plug)
Ooh, she bougie, she busy (busy)
F- it, might buy her a Bentley (Bentley, f- it)
Go (go), go to the floor and pick up (and pick up)
She calling my phone, might pick up (brr)
She too bad, I might miss her (Rich)
Talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (talk to me)
