Song Name: It's Crazy (feat. Melody)
It's crazy
I'm still here livin' this lifestyle with the n-- I came with
I always just did what I had to do, I never tried bein' a gangster
My hand on the tooly while I'm on the stage
F-- it, now I gotta be dangerous
To keep it a hundred, I rather the money, I never wanted to be famous
To keep it a hundred, these n-- be buggin'
Just run up on me if you anxious
And n-- be totin' the grip for no reason
And don't even know how to aim it
By the look on your face, I can tell you're in your feelings
Trust me, you don't gotta say sh--
And I don't even wanna feel how you feel, baby, I wanna be painless
Whatever you wanna do, I'm off of '42 and I do not want no chaser
And you need a n-- that handle your attitude, but I'm a n-- with paper
You probably just love me for my lifestyle, how I pull up in the latest
But I could read you like a book, I just be over here flippin' through pages
Hmm
Dada, I'm home
Where are you?
It's me, Melody, pick up the phone
Mmm
Miss you, I love you
I love you too
And girl, I'ma love you forever, you know this already, you know it's true
And even when I'm gone, I'ma be with you forever, unplugable
Before I even thought about going half on a baby
Girl, even your moms could tell you all about it, baby, I'm crazy
If they ever try to throw shots, I'll dive in front of you
I know I be f-- up, baby, but don't you go lookin' for something new
I don't wanna lay up with none of these b--, I wanna lay up with you
And I ain't no dummy, these b-- be lovin' me 'cause of my revenue
They be tellin' you rumors, spreadin' rumors that was never true, yeah
Only want me to lose 'cause I'm makin' too much to be sweatin' you
And n-- be sellin' records off of hype now, that ain't nothin' new (Yeah)
And my diamonds be goin' off without a light, now, yeah, it's crazy
My diamonds be goin' off without a light now, n-- rockin' fugazi
And everywhere I go, I'm hearin' my style, n-- gon' have to pay me
I bought me a Lam' and promised myself that I'd never go back to Mercedes
I just been goin' through phases
