Song Name: Right On
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that s- look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
My lil' youngin ready to slide, he listen to Shiesty all day
Everybody in a supercharger, I know we getting away
She want me to c- inside of who, I n- in her face
I don't like to go too many places, I run shit in the A
Get a hotel for a year straight, ain't no pillow where I stay
I know b- who set niggas up, yeah
I know n- who whack b- too, yeah
I been in a hundred million movies
Life is real, let her pop a p-, she enjoyed herself
Bad b-, put 'em in the ring, they go below the belt
No referee, ain't no stoppin' me, I'm tryna take it there
The only problems I'm havin' in life is which watch I'ma wear
I grew up on that take it s-, I don't know how to steal
I ain't with all that fakin' s-, I'd rather keep it real
You mad at me about a b- who f- both of us
I went and ran my money up, I swear it's over for 'em
I done gave my feelings up, I don't know who to trust
S- comin' up missin' at the spot, I don't know who to bust
She my gangster b-, I gave her racks and told her, "Stash that"
Love it when you throw it back like, damn, you know that a- fat
You know I'ma blast back, you know I'm way past that
So why you acting like it's something that it wasn't?
She know how to make me mad, I swear this b- push every button
I know how to run up cash, I swear I'm gettin' hella money, real spill
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that s- look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that s- look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Bae, don't put me on your camera, you know what I look like
She like, "Put it in me raw," I asked her like, "What I look like?"
Bae, just call me when you get here, you know I don't book flights
We can't pop out, it won't even look right
I just hit the woman of my dreams with another -
I done scratched ten million off my bucket list
I'm never on no sucker -
My city stand behind me, that's why I love this s-
Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of s-, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy s-, I don't want the b-
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country s-
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun
Catch me cuttin' up in that ZR1, it's the fast kind
I done got my s- together, I'm way better than last time, yeah
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that s- look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that s- look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
