Song Name: Drop A Location
Look, that's on God
Baby, you know we could run it up
I know I show a different type of love
And I know you like to be particular
So I took you to the store, let you pick your Louis slides
Just drop a location and we could slide
You be callin' me fake, but I ain't the type
I could pick you up in any type of ride
That you ever wanted to get, but she ain't ready for that, yeah
Fuck with the fella and I'ma get you right
Get you out the compact Prius with check engine light
Get you out the three hunnid square footage, come spend the night
Let me show you how I'm livin' life
Everybody over here a baller for sure
She'll never pick Louis over Christian Dior, let's be for real
She don't fuck with Michael or Kors, my bitch ill
Ran up the M-berlys on 'em without a deal
Nigga rich now, continue to stay down like you been down
Way too solid, that's on my mom and them
Minnesota area code, I told her, "Lock it in"
Made her pick a side of the field, like, "Who you rockin' with?"
Look, that's on God
Baby, you know we could run it up
I know I show a different type of love
And I know you like to be particular
So I took you to the store, let you pick your Louis slides
Just drop a location and we could slide
You be callin' me fake, but I ain't the type
I could pick you up in any type of ride
That you ever wanted to get, but she ain't ready for that, yeah
Come be my lady, come roll up, drive me crazy
For me, it's safety, if I trust you, I fuck with you daily
It seem like lately all your friends been havin' babies
Fuck in Mercedes, hit it raw and come have you a baby
Yeah, 'cause you my type
I'm a gangster for sure, but I treat you nice
Her ex keep callin', but that's alright
Put her in some ice, she gon' put him on ice
Yeah, my baby boss
She wears Chanel the best, she fuck it up
Call me by my government name, I let her do that
If it's mines, I'll eat the box wearin' a durag
Look, that's on God
Baby, you know we could run it up
I know I show a different type of love
And I know you like to be particular
So I took you to the store, let you pick your Louis slides
Just drop a location and we could slide
You be callin' me fake, but I ain't the type
I could pick you up in any type of ride
That you ever wanted to get, but she ain't ready for that
