Song Name: High John
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah
Praying they still make love in my size
Sober up and wipe the crust out my eyes
My last integrity and trust a trail of crumbs for my bride
Is it a return or a failure to succumb to the tide?
When Charlotte people seen folks cherish me was such a surprise
They seeing something we not
Since doctors sliced open my stomach at five
More often than not at sustenance a nah before a nod
It's stock in the Glock
I'm crashing if it's eye for an еye
Poppa taught me a lot
Love and disrеspect is all we abide
I had to get a check I wanted a commune
Either a big BM or a Benz for my mom
Soon popping benzos turned her grin into monsoon
A long June the summer after
We made the turn on the long route for the plunder
Casted in small rooms knitting heart loom spinning something tragic
But, love from fragments automatic just that Sumter magic
Bumped my cap and crack
For that puff a raw or pump a baddie
Always keep a driver by the caddie, why we lugging baggage?
Niggas want my status so attack me, they just hustling backwards
Models and bottles coming matching we prefer the black ones
Don't need no flashiness, the stats and graphs reveal the stature
Older heads sad 'bout how it happened, take 'em out to pasture
Niggas won't gassing me or asking my opinion last year
We was our only love
Struggle a teach you some
12th grade I rode east with Ahmir to go and meet the plug
We learned we built this off belief we ain't e'en need the drugs
I told mom I'll trek D.C. if it'll please her
But degree don't seem to speak no more
The pain hit deeper when your people ain't in reach no more
'Cause greed would feed them more
Praying they still make love in my size
Sober up and wipe the crust out my eyes
My last integrity and trust a trail of crumbs for my bride
Is it a return or a failure succumb to the tide?
Money got bigger, but my problems never shrunk down to size
They was just feeling it, but then the sun had shrunk out the sky
You need my echo just to hear from me
But I'ma echo in your memory, yeah, yeah
Alright
