Song Name: F9mily (You & Me)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
You, and me
Yeah we, gotta fix this family
And I know, it's hard
But oh, we at least gotta start
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
You (Yes you, yes you) and me (And me)
Yeah we, make pods, we the peas
Now let's go (Let's go, let's go), get knee (Get knee)
Your knee is deep in happy fantasies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
You and me, you best believe
-Ily, you see
Get to three, relieve
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh me, oh me
Who's up? Is it me?
I don't think it's you, hold on, hold on
