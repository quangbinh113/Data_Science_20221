Song Name: LOYAL (feat. Drake)
True, you're a star in my head
You, nuh need fi raise war with my friends
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you or my friends
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Please stay true, but we can part again, yeah, yeah
Because, true, you're my best friend
All the way 'round, I'm loyal
I got money on me and I'm loyal
I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh
Pain goes away when I'm tipsy
Pain goes away when you're with me (me)
Even when your troubles all look risky
It's all under control
Shawty, just don't let this go (just don't let this go)
We spent the last three summers on our own (spent the summer on our own)
We get it on and then you go
I just don't want anyone (no one)
No one at home
True, you're a star in my head (it's the truth)
You nuh need fi raise war with my friends, no, no
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you, or my friends
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Because, true, when we can part again
You'll see you, you're my best friend
All the way 'round, I'm loyal (oh)
I got money on me and I'm loyal (oh)
I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh (oh)
Pain goes away when I'm tipsy (oh)
Pain goes away when you're with me (me, oh)
Even when your troubles all look risky
It's all under control
Shawty, just don't let this go (just don't let this go)
We spent the last three summers on our own (spent the summers on our own)
We get it on and then you go
I just don't wanna let go
No one at home
Please don't let this go
We spent the last three summers on our own
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
I just don't want anyone
No one at home
