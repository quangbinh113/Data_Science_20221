Song Name: Everything Different
(D-Diego)
Mally Mall
Diamonds dancin', new car automatic, I don't never panic
Think I need a challenge, and bitch you better not never chance it
Back then I was broke, I ask for something and I ain't never handed
Now bitch I'm up, I book myself, and I don't need a manage
Drop out, I was blowing the block out, and I don't plan on coming down
And these niggas be scared, drop they head when we come around
Post up with a hunnid rounds, walk out, never standing down
Not worried 'bout a thing 'cause I got money now
Crossed by the ones I love, yeah
I don't know who I can trust
We confident, they don't know about us, yеah
They only knew who we was, yеah
Now everything different, exotic bitch, exotic cars
I come straight up out them trenches, everybody 'round me stars
Million plus inside my bank, so every night, I'm thanking God
And I'm caught up in twilight, yeah, I can take you far
And it be too much on my mind, I don't even know where I should start
I tell 'em, "I'll be fine", but deep inside, I been scarred
I tatted, "Hard Times", for all the times that it was hard
It been a bumpy ride, I was thinkin' 'bout puttin' the car in park like
Freeze, my heart been broke and my shit frozen on zero degrees
Just rolled the dice, think it out twice before crossin' on me
My arms was open for you, homie, whatever you need
But my eyes is open for you, woadie, I clearly can see
They'll take your kindness for a weakness
Keep you kindness, I don't need it
I was blind but now I see it
And I still love you, nigga, but I just ain't fucking with ya
You know what it was, my nigga, can't forgive ya or forget ya
And I came a long way from the trenches, got in my bag and got out my feelings
Niggas been grindin' since the beginning
Even with my eyes closed, I'm winnin'
I just booked five shows for a million, I gotta keep my mind on big business
And I gotta keep my eyes on all these niggas, yeah
I don't trust these niggas, yeah
Crossed by the ones I love, yeah
I don't know who I can trust
We confident, they don't know about us, yeah
They only knew who we was, yeah
Now everything different, exotic bitches, exotic cars
I come straight up out them trenches, everybody 'round me stars
Million plus inside my bank, so every night, I'm thanking God
And I'm caught up in twilight, yeah, I can take you far
And I come from the block, where killas post up everyday, yeah
Caught up with the cops and never break inside a cage, yeah
Invest inside them blocks and keep a cutter where I stay at
And all my niggas thuggin', play, we shoot you in your face, yeah
I gotta come down if I want this life I live for to last
I'm waking up with no regrets, I cannot hide from my past
And I won't fall for anything, but play, we busting your ass, yeah
Jump in a whip without no license, hit the gas and go fast
And I can't change if I wanted to
Forgive me for the pain and everything that I put you through
Been failing my whole life, I'm at the point where I won't never lose
I'll lay down and do life behind my gang, no, I won't never choose
Crossed by the ones I love, yeah
I don't know who I can trust
We confident, they don't know about us, yeah
They only knew who we was, yeah
Now everything different, exotic bitches, exotic cars
I come straight up out them trenches, everybody 'round me stars
Million plus inside my bank, so every night, I'm thanking God
And I'm caught up in twilight, yeah, I can take you far
