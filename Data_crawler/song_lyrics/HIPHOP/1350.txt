Song Name: Changes
Changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Always changing faces
I'm gone with them phases
I'm gone with them changes
Changes
I'm gone with them changes
All those changing faces
I'll go with them phases
So Long since I've seen a shit could feel a change
Every
Shit could feel a change
Every
Long since I've seen a shit could feel a change
Every
Love calls for the price tag in the ball court
Still love you when we part though
Blame me like its my fault
Still love, still love came
Hop around like you hardcore
Hop around like you parkour
Spillin' off
Still love, still love came
Still love, still love came
Still love, still love came (changes)
Still love, still love came
Look, I gotta text from this girl I used to see
Saying that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologise, but this messsage fucked me up
Then I would ski-ski every girl when after applying best of luck to ya
Fast forward couple months I'm like "Wassup witcha?"
Cos something changed I know ya feel it (feel it)
But really its been a little minute
Ain't nothing changed but the address,
My neighbors hate how I be living (living)
Mad there's a loud rich nigga in the building
Like fuck all the other tenants, (running)
Bought mine but you renting, (running)
Rich niggas in your feelings, (running)
Rich niggas in your feelings
Pants packed, knapsack packed like I'm leaving home
They ain't want to let me go, guess you need me more (bye)
I was on the road on tour
She just said I changed for the worst
Rain flags, rainbacks guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, guess you need it more
(Changes)
Sweetest smile
(Phases)
Upside down
(Phases)
I'll be cruel to you
(Changes)
Come on if you love me now
These ain't monkey bars, for no fucking kiddy park
Hit you with the chicky pox nigga shitting on me, need my litty box
Lean gone, see the fox
Old three Billy Park, by the chemy shop
Fifty vicky fox
Time to give them what they want right?
Give 'em love mixed with Biggie Pac
Weird nigga from the block
Square bitches getting boxed
She pussy popping Iggy Pop
You pussy niggas really pop
Thanks for the light, waiting for the light
Change for a lifetime
Thanks for the night, drinks for the night
Waiting for the right time
(What a wonderful life)
(Changed for the better changed for the worse)
So far I feel better, feel a lotta change, changes
So far I feel better, feel a lotta change, changes
My biggest distractions is that I get distracted
People suing me for shit that didn't happen
I wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me
Wake up to my explore page
See my exes engaged, or either getting married
Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months,
Post-natal post, post nup, that little nigga pappy
I wonder if they really happy or just getting at me
So long since I've seen a shit could feel a changes
Changes
Could feel a changes
Changes
Long since I've seen a shit could feel a changes
Changes
So Long since I've seen a shit could feel a changes
Changes
Shit could feel a changes
Changes
So Long since I've seen a shit could feel a changes
Changes
Shit could feel a changes
Changes
Changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
Go with them changes
