If you never went jail (Boom)
If you never went jail, you'll be on a mill
But I been jail too, and I ran through a few (Bap, bap, bap)
Oi, you niggas better at their wage
I can't even tell guys, "Act their age" (Baow)
D2traps, twenty-eight, acts younger than me
Traps likes girls younger that's younger than me (Baow)
I'm twenty-one with a gun, what they done on the P? (Baow)
Corn gets bust, go and ask D2 (Baow, baow, baow)
We're not the ones that's dead, bro, Assassin (Boom)
Ask him, gang pulled up, so I slap him (Grrt, baow)
Blast him, shit's way deeper than rappin'
Casket, when have I run? Stab it (Baow, baow-baow-baow)
We don't kill little pups, we drop big plugs
The ones that's supposed to be thugs (Baow)
Know you've heard about us (Bluuwuu), but we're used to this stuff
So we didn't even kick up a fuss (Baow, baow, boom)
If you ain't shot nobody then shut up (Shh), shut the fuck up (Bang)
Run from the gun and get bun up (Grrt, bang)
Bleach from that till the sun up (Grrt, baow)
Between me and you
I'll act the same too if you drop my niggas, kill off (Bap, bap)
Fidget, I'm grippin' the spinner (Bap)
Pull out the hammer, click on the trigger, bang (Uh, uh)
Niggas say they're spinnin' it, they ain't spinnin' though (Uh, uh)
Niggas say they're drillin',
They ain't drillin' though (Drillin' though)
, Your baby mother used to come and visit me
And I got the letters from her little bro (Uh, uh, uh)
Digga D, I'm in love with violence, violence, works with Trident
All of them know, but they keepin' it silent
The need some guidance (Pussy)
Can't be gang, you don't fit the requirements (No)
, All soon go in retirement
Where are they hidin'? And man wan' findin' 'em

I'm a man with integrity, even when they beggin' me,
I ain't deadin' beef with none of them (No)

I'll smile in your face and shake your hand
The minute you turn your back, I'll stab it (Stab it)
Stabbing's a habit (Yeah),
When my head get hot (Grrt), I'll grab it (Baow)
I don't mean to be rude, but it's '022,
If you got a shotgun, better stay in your crib (Bo-bo)
This ain't '017 (No),
My gun got a beam, extended clip that's filled to the tip (*gunshot*)
Gunman in their face, point-blank with the gauge
But, he never died, so, I hate them sticks
My name Shotty Shane,
If I pick up a gauge, nowadays,
It's gotta hold minimum six (Grrt, baow)
Can't be hands-off, man's hands-on with this handgun,
Bang one of them, man's gone (Bap, bap)
You ever see a stick get knocked off? (*whistle*)
You ever see a strip get locked off? (Baow)
Can't be hands-off, man's hands-on with this handgun,
Bang one of them, man's gone (Bap, bap)
You ever see a face get chopped out? (Ying)
You ever make a man get dropped out? (Uh, uh) (Dead)
Niggas say they're spinnin' it, they ain't spinnin' though (Uh, uh)
Niggas say they're drillin',
They ain't drillin' though (Drillin' though)
, Your baby mother used to come and visit me
And I got the letters from her little bro (Uh, uh, uh)
2K gonna slay, yeah
