Song Name: Versace (Remix)
Zaytoven
Yeah
Oh shit, man, who that is?
Shoutout Migos, shoutout Zaytoven one time
That's Migos and Drake at the Versace store
Versace, Versace
Medusa head on me like I'm illuminati (Versace)
This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property (Gate)
Rap must be changing 'cause I'm at the top
And ain't no one on top of me (Woo)
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse
But man that's not a swap to me (Nah)
Drowning in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis (Metropolis?)
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man, I guess I'm an optimist (Milli')
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us (Go)
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars, boy
Versace, Versace
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace
I just won a Grammy (Woo)
I've been so quiet, I got the world like
What the fuck is he planning?
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy (Go, go)
Started a label, the album is comin' September
Just wait on it (Just wait on it)
This year I'm eating your food
And my table got so many plates on it (So many)
Hundred-inch TV at my house
I sit back like, damn I look great on it (Damn, I look good)
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga
Don't ask for my take on it (Don't ask for my opinion)
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga
That trap out the bando (Bando, bando)
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano (Brr, brr, brr)
Fuck all your feelin's 'cause business is business
It's strictly financial (Business is business)
I'm always the first one to get it
Man that's how you lead by example (I got it)
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace (Versace)
Word in New York is the Dyckman and Heights girls
Are callin' me Papi (Woo, woo)
I'm all on the low
Take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi (Splash)
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me (Smash)
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace
Medusa head on me like I'm Illuminati
I know that you like it
Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti
He give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch, Versace
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
You niggas they wishin' they knew yah
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louie
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a stripped shirt like I'm Tony the Tiger
I'm beating the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace
King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin', Versace I'm grippin' them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm livin'
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm sellin' them bows
Versace take over it took out my soul
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace
Zaytoven
