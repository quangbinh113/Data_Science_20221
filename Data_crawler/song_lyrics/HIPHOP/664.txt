Song Name: Backseat (feat. PnB Rock)
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (oh-oh)
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (oh-oh)
Ayy, like here we go, here we go, here we go now
Me and you catchin' fights when it go down
Late nights in Dubai, it's a coupe (skrrt)
Been fallin' fast, can't lie, it's the truth (nah)
Like here we go, here we go, here we go now (here we go)
I swear I feel like I've been here before now
Can you meet me coming from my house? (on my own)
And I'd rather chill with you than with my bros (all my bros)
So let's get high in the back seat
Park up on the back street behind
Your house (back street behind your house)
As long as we keep them lights down
And the noise down
He can never find out (he can never find out), yeah
So let's get high in the back seat
Park up on the back street
Behind your house (back street behind your house)
As long as we keep them lights down
And the noise dow
He can never find out (he will never ever find out), yeah
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (here we go)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (ayy)
Oh, oh-oh-oh (here we go)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh (here we go)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
(Down, he can never find out)
Look, here we go, baby, here we go
Shawty, why you playin'? I could put your neck on froze
Drip you in designer, we all up in the stores
Gucci on your body, even on your drawers
I swear you got me 'bout to risk it all
Would you be there if I was to fall?
There's some things I gotta know (gotta know)
Girl, can I trust you for sure?
'Cause we can go, smoke dope in the Rolls
Two doors, skrrt-skrrt, takin' off
We can go, anywhere you wanna go
Twist and smoke as you play your role, play your role
Play your role, I might take you home in my gang
Show you that I ain't nothin' like these other lames
Shawty, you know you could be my new main
I could put you on some new things
So let's get high in the back seat
Park up on the back street behind
Your house (back street behind your house)
As long as we keep them lights down
And the noise down,
He can never find out (he can never find out), yeah
So let's get high in the back seat
Park up on the back street
Behind your house (back street behind your house)
As long as we keep them lights down
And the noise down
He can never find out (he will never ever find out), yeah
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (here we go)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh-oh (here we go)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh (here we go)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
(Down, he can never find out)
