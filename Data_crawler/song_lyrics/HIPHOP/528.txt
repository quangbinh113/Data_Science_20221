Song Name: First Place
Don't give a fuck what nah nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only take your friends in the Wraith
You got no friends in this race
Bro, you gotta understand niggas fake
Knock 'em off if they stand in the way
Shawty hopping off vans with the K
I don't seen my own friends tryna snake
Had to see my own mans telling jakes
I know God got plans for me now
Because he put bands on the plate
One static put bands on his face
Bet he gon' understand we don't play
First nigga try to reach say it now
He gon' die where he stand here today
I was passing out dog food in them dope lines
Streets voucher for me fuck a co-sign
When we gang banging we tote iron
You earn respect with a 45
Imma let it spark when it's show time
2014, when my bro died
Seen a lot of niggas really won't ride
Wanna see you smile one more time
Gotta damage hard I done had enough
I don't wanna here no more lies
And a lot of niggas lost their head in this shit
I'd be damned if I let 'em smoke mine
Promised Maxine I was gon' shine
Get my bands up cop the X.7
On the highway and that hoe flyin'
Money power fame make a hoe blind
And the vibes be so fake
So showing love feel weird
Fuck the opps and the jakes
I wish my thug was still here
We got no remorse
We send them slugs for them tears
I got my back against the wall
I think my trust disappeared
Don't give a fuck what nah nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only take your friends in the Wraith
You got no friends in this race
Bro, you gotta understand niggas fake
Knock 'em off if they stand in the way
Shawty hopping off vans with the K
I don't seen my own friends tryna snake
Had to see my own mans telling jakes
I know God got plans for me now
Because he put bands on the plate
One static put bands on his face
Bet he gon' understand we don't play
First nigga try to reach say it now
He gon' die where he stand here today
I don't been through it I seen a lot
Made it out now I feel like I want it all
Money been coming in gotta stack it tall
If you build your shit right it won't ever fall
I don't know about y'all but I gotta ball
When I'm getting my bag I just hit the mall
Way before you gon' walk niggas gotta crawl
Nigga saying he gang well I don't recall
Tryna make sure my team right
Each every niggaa gon' go if I give him that green light
He front of the scene pipes
Shooters right here little boy what you mean fight
Savage even if I seem nice
I know niggas taking my glizzy the beam tight
No movin' the scheme tight
Blue cheese up in 'em, Amiris, my jean tight
And I gotta eat now
I know momma happy
Her son on his feet now
I'm bringing the heat now
For 2020 I be shutting the streets down
Lil TJay a beast now
I got up my Birkin watch everyone feast now
I mean this from deep down
Don't try to come rob me
You see me don't speak down
Don't give a fuck what nah nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only take your friends in the Wraith
You got no friends in this race
Bro, you gotta understand niggas fake
Knock 'em off if they stand in the way
Shawty hopping off vans with the K
