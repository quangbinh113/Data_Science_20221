Song Name: Bag Talk
Told him we gotta
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
We could turn the beat up some more
Uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh
Bag on an opp, now we gettin' him clapped
Switches let off, we gettin' him wrapped
Shots from the Drac' comb out his naps
Now shawty 'nem checkin' the Citizen app
I got some niggas up in them Scat Packs slidin'
And some niggas that's still in the trap
Fuck nigga keep on dissin' in raps
Pressin' my buttons and triggers get tapped
You know this gangster shit all in my blood
I still do it for Durb and Lamp
You could pick any location in the city, I'm good
Bitch, everywhere I go, I'm stamped
I'ma keep on runnin' and runnin' and runnin' up mills
Don't care if I'm catchin' a cramp
Bitch, I need every dime, I stay on my grind
Like Tony Hawk up that ramp, uh
Bag talk, I keep havin' bad thoughts
Stay in somethin' fast, I'ma stomp the gas and ride off
Pussy niggas play up in thеse streets, get left on sidеwalks
I told bronem that we gotta win, can't leave my guys lost
I ain't tryna talk, you can get your mind chalked
Had to step up for my block, they don't know 'bout all them battles fought
Now I got this shit on lock, no, I can't take no time off
Broski always sippin' Wock', you would think he had a bad cough
Uh, you get what you put in in these streets, shit like an algorithm
Twenty-four in this FN, with all these shots, I'm bound to get him
Grouchie love his glizzy ten, I'll have my problem child come blitz him
Go to war, let's get it in, if you play with my hounds, I'll sick him
For a couple pounds, we hit him, took him down, we strip him
Catch him out of bounds, we clip him, heard it's a man down, go zip him
I miss rockin' out with my dog, if B was alive, I'd still be with him
Fuck all the opps, we don't care about y'all, we tryna catch every G and kill 'em, uh
Bag talk, I keep havin' bad thoughts
Stay in somethin' fast, I'ma stomp the gas and ride off
Pussy niggas play up in these streets, get left on sidewalks
I told bronem that we gotta win, can't leave my guys lost
I ain't tryna talk, you can get your mind chalked
Had to step up for my block, they don't know 'bout all them battles fought
Now I got this shit on lock, no, I can't take no time off
Broski always sippin' Wock', you would think he had a bad cough
Bag talk, I keep havin' bad thoughts
Stay in somethin' fast, I'ma stomp the gas and ride off
Pussy niggas play up in these streets, get left on sidewalks
I told bronem that we gotta win, can't leave my guys lost
I ain't tryna talk, you can get your mind chalked
Had to step up for my block, they don't know 'bout all them battles fought
Now I got this shit on lock, no, I can't take no time off
Broski always sippin' Wock', you would think he had a bad cough
