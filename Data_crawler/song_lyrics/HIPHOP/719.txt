Song Name: Many Men
Metro
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I kept it silent the whole time (Ayy)
I ain't never, ever play both sides (Ayy)
East side nigga 'bout gunfire (Ayy)
Pull up in a van and the door slide (Ayy)
We ain't never throwin' no white flag (Straight up)
Gotta get smoke when the bros die (Straight up)
They gon' spin 'til the car hot (Straight up)
Don't call my phone 'til some ho die
New Maybach, I don't need no key
I was in the dirt, you believed in me
My attention span too short
Don't wait for pussy, you teasin' me
Bad lil' vibe, she pleasin' me
Spend a whole M, yeah, easily
I get the cash and put it up fast
I think I got JB in me
Edge of the bed, she sit up (Ayy)
Suckin' on the it 'til she got hiccups (Yeah)
Back in the day I did stickups (Ayy)
Favorite hotbox was a pick up (Yeah)
Say you want smoke, don't pick us (21)
Face shot, now you can't get up (21)
Count a lot gang, nigga, shut up (21)
We known for shootin' shit the fuck up (21)
Hundred large in these Amiris, they all Crippy (Blue)
I got vibes eatin' Addys off ass and titties (Loose)
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD (Pussy)
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50 (Pussy)
I got small fries want my spot, tryna defeat me (Pussy)
I got real model bitches tryna R&B me (Pussy)
All that cap inside your raps, I ain't even play your CD (21)
Won't go back and forth on the
Internet, we put niggas on TV (Big facts)
I got your bitch and her BB (Big facts)
Hit her in the shower, Mimi (Big facts)
Next day she tryna see me (Straight up)
Told her I'm blind, Stevie (Stevie)
Nice girls can't even keep me (Never)
Need a bad girl like RiRi (Yeah, yeah)
We don't pump fake, we kill beef (21)
21 Savage, not Jeezy (Pussy)
I got your bitch in New York (I do)
She in the heels on the coke (She is)
I pull it out of my pants (I did)
She put it right in her throat (She did)
Fish scales smellin' like polish (You dig?)
They brought it right off the boat (You dig?)
Front door, back door king
I done probably robbed your bro (I did)
Come up with a plan, better huddle (21)
Left wrist lookin' like a puddle (21)
When I'm in the street, it's trouble (21)
That's why I stay in my bubble (I do)
Brand new Rari so fast,
When I stomp the pedal to the floor, it stutter (Skrrt)
I ain't use a rubber and I make M's,
That's why I'm chasin' this butter (On God)
Hundred large in these Amiris, they all Crippy (Blue)
I got vibes eatin' Addys off ass and titties (Loose)
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD (Pussy)
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50 (Pussy)
I got small fries want my spot, tryna defeat me (Pussy)
I got real model bitches tryna R&B me (Pussy)
All that cap inside your raps, I ain't even play your CD (21)
Won't go back and forth on the
Internet, we put niggas on TV (Big facts)
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wish death upon
Many men wish death upon
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away
The evil man envies the good in others
What this means is all hatred is really born from hatred itself
And can only serve to aid in one's own destruction
This is the downfall of many men
