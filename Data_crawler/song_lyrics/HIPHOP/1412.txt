Song Name: One Of Dem Nights (with Jhen√© Aiko)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah
I really love the way you love me
It's the passion for me
I know you the realest 'cause you'd do anything for me, yeah
I don't want nothin' else, I need you to myself
It is without a doubt, baby, I cannot help it
It's the way you treat my little booty like I got a big ol' booty
Always keep me in the mood and give me that dick when I'm moody
Just to soothe me, ooh wee, you be doin' it just right
It is always one of those nights
It's gon' be one of them nights (one of those nights)
It's gon' be one of them nights (one of them nights)
It's gon' be one of them nights, pussy print show through them tights
Tell me that it's mine and only mine, don't make me ask you twice
Ride with me, keep it G
L-U-V, it's the loyalty for me, your energy, uh
L-U-V, love (oh, oh-oh)
Ride with me, thug
You get nasty, duh
X-rated, uncut
Face unique, don't need no beat
Her physic is givin' me, blessed, is she top-notch? Yes (yes)
So she deserve more not less (I gets)
So I still slut her out then spoil her (we live)
She a dime, in the store, spent a quarter (2.5)
Big Bagg, she love my aura (my swag)
Got her wetter than the water in Florida
Drinkin' and smokin', I'm high and I'm geeked
Controllin' the traffic wherever I be
From the bottom of the trap to the top of the streets
Pussy tastin' like star fruit, that's all that she eat (mm)
Ratchet but look like a model to me
It's the gangsta in me that do somethin' for her
One minute she through but I'm knowin' what's up
I'm hustlin', she say I don't fuck her enough
It's gon' be one of them nights (one of those nights)
It's gon' be one of them nights (one of them nights)
It's gon' be one of them nights, pussy print show through them tights
Tell me that it's mine and only mine, don't make me ask you twice
Ride with me, keep it G
L-U-V, it's the loyalty for me, your energy, uh
L-U-V, love (oh, oh-oh)
Ride with me, thug
You get nasty, duh
X-rated, uncut
Oh, oh-oh
