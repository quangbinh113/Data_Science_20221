Song Name: Proud of You
(Woah Kenny!)
Like a preschooler in my garage playing switcharoo
I park the red one, put the yellow in front of the blue
I had the county blues, now every day I'm counting the blues
No lean and Mountain Dews, Guwop I'm so proud of you
Accountants count it, two stacks so tall got a mountain view
My house so big, this bitch mistook it for the Fountain Bleu (Huh?)
First time I copped the Deuce, said
"Guwop, I'm so proud of you" (Skrrt, skrrt)
Guwop's the Trap God and they quote me more than Dr. Seuss (Wop)
I'm way richer than when I got out
Three years ago (I'm richer than y'all)
I freestyle don't even write
Don't even think no more (I ain't writin' down shit)
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more (Lean, lean)
You ain't my friend, you ain't my rider, man, we can't link no more
(Fuck my opps)
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more (No)
Fresh out parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more (No)
I had the county blues, now every day
I'm countin' the blues (Countin', mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" (No)
(Wop, countin', mwah)
New clothing line call it Delantic (Delantic, it's new, it's new)
My pinky ring sunk the Titanic (It's true, it's true, brr)
She say I'm fine, she threw her panties (Wow)
The coldest nigga on the planet (Brr, it's Wop! Cold)
Coupe dropped the top, I call her Janet (Ya dirty bitch)
Them boys fell off, it's like they vanished (Well damn)
Extendo tucked, this bitch gigantic (I upped that shit)
I upped the strap, them niggas panic (Wop)
I'm way richer than when I got out
Three years ago (I'm richer than y'all)
I freestyle don't even write
Don't even think no more (I ain't writin' down shit)
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more (Lean, lean)
You ain't my friend, you ain't my rider, man, we can't link no more
(Fuck my opps)
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more (No)
Fresh out parole, and I can't go back to the clip no more (No)
I had the county blues, now every day
I'm countin' the blues (Countin', mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" (No)
(Wop, countin', mwah)
"Gu-Guwop I'm so proud of you" (Huh?)
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you"
