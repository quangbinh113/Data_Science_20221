Song Name: Sarcoma
Find me a new-made grave
And hide me like a dead man
I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference from sleeping away
I'm losing my patience
I can't feel my faith
I can't feel my
Way before you came along I was doing alright
Days I'd hold you in my arms, I would give you my life
Heart break open, me, I take my blood from my eyes
California something about you is on in my mind
Another lonely day, reminisce the memories that you erase
I'd rather go insane and yet you're telling me I'm gonna be okay
Another lonely day, reminisce the memories that you erase
I'd rather go insane and yet you're telling me I'm gonna be okay
Find me a new-made grave
And hide me like a dead man
I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference from sleeping away
I'm losing my patience
I can't feel my faith
I can't feel my
Way before you came along I was doing alright
Days I'd hold you in my arms, I would give you my life
Heart break open, me, I take my blood from my eyes
California something about you is on in my mind
