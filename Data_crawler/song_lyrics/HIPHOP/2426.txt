Song Name: Let Me Know (feat. Jeremih)
(Bang!)
(Oh lord Jason made another one)
(Let me know)
Yeah (Let me know)
Let me know
Let me know (Let me know)
If you're ever here tired of your nigga, lil bitch yeah
All you gotta do is, let me know
It's some real boss niggas in the building lil bitch yeah
I just thought that I should let you know
(Let me know) You ever tired of that nigga? Let 'em go
(Let me know) Fucking with some real bosses he was broke
(Let me know) If you wanna come with me, you could go
(Let me know) Hit my phone when he leave, let me know
I know you tired of that nigga, it's a lot he lacking
I know you tired, need to tell his broke ass "get to packing"
He ain't getting money, I could tell by how that lil ten had him reacting
I'm the nigga giving all the bad bitches captions
Leave that nigga, come with me, he won't know what happen
All my life I've been having bad bitches, I just started rapping
Jesus Christ in the coupe sideways, nigga ain't no traction
She gon let me know when you leave and when to come and get her
My bitch bad, I just dropped the wood and niggas still can't hit her
I'm in Nordstroms I'm in Neiman's, I ain't never even been to dealers
Got your bitch with me told her she can get whatever fit her
Old hoes sending paragraphs saying how I did her
If you're ever here tired of your nigga, lil bitch yeah
All you gotta do is, let me know
It's some real boss niggas in the building lil bitch yeah
I just that I should let you know
(Let me know) You ever tired of that nigga? let 'em go
(Let me know) Fucking with some real bosses, he was broke
(Let me know) If you wanna come with me, you could go
(Let me know) Hit my phone when he leave, let me know
How the fuck you let a broke nigga stress you?
Matter fact meet me on Rodeo drive, I'm finna bless you
Told me he was low on funds and he never treat you special
I'm finna blow this money on you, I'm not finna give no lectures
That nigga made a lot of promises he couldn't keep
Clearly see that he a'int fucking with me honestly
She just wanna suck it, yeah she fucking up the driver's seat
Yeah his pockets empty nigga had you feeling incomplete
I should bussdown your wrist with this Cartier
Take you out the country, fuck you good, yeah we far away
I might let you in this penthouse, let you decorate
Nigga always saying y'all should go to eat but he don't wanna pay
If you're ever here tired of your nigga, lil bitch yeah
All you gotta do is, let me know
It's some real boss niggas in the building lil bitch yeah
I just thought that I should let you know
(Let me know) You ever tired of that nigga? let 'em go
(Let me know) You fucking with some real bosses, he was broke
(Let me know) If you wanna come with me you could go
(Let me know) Hit my phone when he leave, let me know
If you're ever here tired of your nigga, lil bitch yeah
All you gotta do is, let me know
It's some real boss niggas in the building lil bitch yeah
I just thought that I should let you know
(Let me know) You ever tired of that nigga? let 'em go
(Let me know) You fucking with some real bosses, he was broke
(Let me know) If you wanna come with me you could go
(Let me know) Hit my phone when he leave, let me know
(Let me know)
(Let me know)
(Let me know)
(Let me know)
