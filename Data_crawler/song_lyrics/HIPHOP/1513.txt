Song Name: MPR
This is a mellow
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
Wait, It's big 092MLBOA
Teach you
You gotta gun, nigga
Me too, me too
Fly down your block like an eagle (eagle)
We makin' movies like regal (boom,boom,boom,boom)
Teach you
No, you can't hide, boy, I see you
See you, you ain't getting bread nigga, g'd you
Fuck is you talking bout? Back out, brush em
Know some niggas that shoot you for nothin'
Gang get to spin only morning, no politics ain't no discussions
Back at your knife, cut em, come to my block, rush em'
Beam, everyboy gots the cig homie
And we gone hurt you if you touch 'em
Tell this beat poppin', stunnin'
They see me start running 'cause they know the gang, and I'm reppin
Treesha! Dirty Diana go get a breath mint before you come get in session
Watchu know bout, watchu know bout fuckin 'lil Texas?
Hurry
Dirty the weapon, gun thinking like its Tetris
Woo
Woo back, walk in your party with 2 straps
Walk in your party like who dat?
Saint Laurent then we gone shoot that
Shoot first, shoot back
It's automatic when the woos clap
Lot a talk on my name, can't prove that
Niggas say I'm a bitch, I'm like who dat?
I come on the block with like two 9's
Everybody know I'm nine, too
Gun to his head if he die, woo
If you don't like me I don't like you, woo
I'm 823, and I'm certified
Know that I'm cool, let that burner fly
I fuck with some movers and Maybachs
I fuck with some rollers and paybacks
Smuff
Vito, give two shits like free throws
Pick up your shots, then reload
No, we don't fuck with them people
On the block with a choppa with just me and
Choppa we chillin, we killas and scamming niggas
Know the force from the H to the K to the rock
Free milly G's out the slamma, nigga
Osha 30 yeah I play with that steal in
Construction, I play with that hammer, nigga
I don't play disrespect, nigga
Watch what you say, my .38 never jam, my nigga
808, 808
Shoot, then I get away, then I go skate in a JL8
Sealed away
Brodie got locked, but he out 'cause he pullin that pillow weight
Tell her wait
No, I can't fuck you today, so you know that, I tell her wait
Heaven gates
I'm tryna send him to heaven gates
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
I need that money, that pow'r, respect
Wait, It's big 092MLBOA
Teach you
