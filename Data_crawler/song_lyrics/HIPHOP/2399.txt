Song Name: Suicide
(Gateway, is that you?)
(Trademark!)
Said, "I've been waiting for a long time, it feel like no time"
And I've been waiting for a long time 'til it's mine
They say time change, how much longer do I got as your lifeline?
And I'm tryin', baby, that was no lie
I just notice every time I do and hit the goal line
It's a closed line
Got me sweatin' like we in the fourth quarter, yeah, yeah
I need your trust and heart and soul, in that order, baby, yeah, yeah
Girl I need one double 0, and only that number, yeah, yeah
Or I'm gon' have to bust your brain
And havе a bloody summer, yeah, yeah
You drivin' mе insane, she said
"That's funny, that's what I was sayin'"
Her life of an outcast, I feel the same
Feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
It feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
And it's funny, 'cause you know I'm so impatient
I'm just waitin' on my lifeline
I just did a show in Seattle (in Seattle)
And I don't know nobody in Seattle, I'on know 'em
1942 and I need the whole bottle, I ain't pouring
I'm tryna give you all the attention that you ordered
Give me a minute, yeah
Fuck all them niggas, I'm too high on marijuana
Rain pourin', tears droppin' at the condo, I ain't goin'
Mercedes-Benz S-Class, where the fuck am I goin'?
You said you hate me in the mornin', now yo' legs wide open
Can you tell me how the fuck do that work?
How the fuck do that work?
When you tell me that you love me
But you cursed at me first
Suicide, ooh-ooh-ooh
Goin' down but I'm still alive
I don't wanna blow my brains and have a bloody summer, yeah, yeah
You drivin' me insane, she said
"That's funny that's what I was sayin'"
Suicide, ooh-ooh-ooh
Feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
It feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
'Cause you knowin' I'm too impatient
I'm waiting on for my life
Tryna get the happy ending, but I know it's fiction
You can try to talk to me, but you know I won't listen
Got a lot of problems, and I know they need some fixing
Diamonds in my mouth
Watch 'em shine and watch 'em glisten, glisten
Know they fuckin' shine, think I'm kiddin'? Kiddin'
It's all a waste of time, they been hittin', hittin'
You won't call a lie
Say that you hate me but I'm still in your life
You can try to move on, but I know you got a type
And I know you gonna sound wrong, but I'm in the right
I need to talk, so give me more life
You in my phone, I'm moving too light
And I told you it was good, as expected
Love that VV on my neck, on my necklace
Shawty, I don't lie, shit been reckless
Really been off of my phone, I don't like texting
You drivin' me insane, she said
"That's funny that's what I was sayin'"
Suicide, ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl, it feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
It feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
'Cause you knowin' I'm too impatient, I'm waiting on for my life
I just left the bank, bank, bank, bank, bank
Turn that shit the fuck up and make it crank, crank, crank
You tried to shoot your shot at me
You hit the bank, bank, bank
Am I your number one, girl?
Really it's fuck the trending topic (yeah)
You said I'd get a little fame, if I'm lucky
Make a few songs and meet a fan one day, if I'm lucky
I did a sold out show in Downtown Kentucky
And now nobody can touch me
Let's play pretending, keep it cool
Like it's really true that you love me
You drivin' me insane, she said
"That's funny that's what I was sayin'"
Suicide, ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl, it feel like I've been waitin' all my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
It feel like I've been waitin' my fuckin' whole life
To be your lifeline (be your lifeline, ooh-ooh)
'Cause you knowin' I'm too impatient, I'm waiting on for my life
