Song Name: Boredom (feat. Rex Orange County & Anna of the North)
When you're having fun, fun (fun)
When you're having fun
Fly out the window (go, go, go)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
'Cause boredom got a new best friend (oh, oh, oh)
Boredom got a new best friend
(Oh, no, no, no)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time

(Find some time, oh)
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I count 'em
If we're talking about real meals
Ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to dry wall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm, bored"
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh, oh, oh)
Boy's getting' desperate as hell
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven't seen the exit of these walls, but fall this morning
(Morning, morning, morning, morning)
Got some calls I can handle
But nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yelling'
I need some food, I go order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone we can loiter in parking lots
And sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like
I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I don't know where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause boredom got a new best friend

Boredom got a new best friend
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"
