Yeah
Uhm
DJ Durel
Yes, sir
Fuck the other shit, I'm goin' for the win (fuckin' win)
Pulled up with that bitch, then pulled off with her friend (skrr)
"How he get that? " Ssh, just know we got it in (brr)
Yeah, my partner 50 Cent, he shot many men (brr)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Who?)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Bitch)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Us)
Better not drop that pin (drop it), we gon' spin again
I'ma spin (spin, spin), we gon' slide (slide)
Drop that pin, pussy nigga, come outside (come outside)
I been runnin' up that chicken, I ain't tired (go)
Ain't shed another tear since when my grandma died (grandma)
I got an all white Rolls with the bloody guts inside (yep)
Think shit sweet, then try it
Steppin' in shoes that's not your size (niggas ain't steppin')
The back of the Maybach, I sit and recline (thinkin' 'bout what?)
And I got Franklins all on my mind, then chrome, then spine (what else?)
Chrome the 9 (then what?) And bulletproof the ride (skrrt)
We spin the block and yell out, "He ain't outside" (where he at?)
Heard he got a weddin', he must be the bride (bitch)
I take them pies, subtract them and divide (takeoff)
Fuck the other shit, I'm goin' for the win (fuckin' win)
Pulled up with that bitch, then pulled off with her friend (skrr)
"How he get that? " Ssh, just know we got it in (brr)
Yeah, my partner 50 Cent, he shot many men (brr)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Woo)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Huncho)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Who?)
Better not drop that pin (drop it), we gon' spin again
Drop the pin, then we goin' in, flip the switch and win (go)
Wide body snatch out the back, almost crashed the Benz (skrr)
If she start trippin', try her friend, now I fuck her twin (smash)
Told your bitch to pop that pussy, plenty more to spend (ugh)
'Case your boy start hookin', then I'm jumpin' in (hey)
Came from nothin', now my Lambo' look like dolphin fins (sky)
You sniffed a bowl full of rice, then I'ma call you Glen (snortin')
Droppin' narcotics devices over prison fence (gone)
Hold that down, handle my business, nigga, let's get it (let's get it)
Nigga, I'm with you, 150 (ugh)
Nigga, it's us versus them for the city (woo)
I know that you scared, you shitty (you scared)
I'm standin' on all the business (on business)
I'm feelin' like Steph and Klay (splash)
We pull up, hit all the swishes (on God)
Fuck the other shit, I'm goin' for the win (fuckin' win)
Pulled up with that bitch, then pulled off with her friend (skrr)
"How he get that? " Ssh, just know we got it in (brr)
Yeah, my partner 50 Cent, he shot many men (brr)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Who?)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Bitch)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Us)
Better not drop that pin (drop it), we gon' spin again
How you think gonna beat the Wop? You know you gonna lose (huh)
Why bring her to the function when you know she wanna choose? (Yeah)
Free Young Thug and Gunna, while you at it Pooh and Foo (slime)
Let my niggas out, you know they havin' somethin' to do (brick)
A street nigga can turn exec' and I'm the livin' proof (wop)
I pull up in a Roadster, had to stop to test the roof (drop)
Real street nigga when I'm in and out the booth
Why when niggas tell they stories, they just sprinkle in the truth? (Well damn)
When they say it's up, it's stuck, gotta be careful how you move (uh)
Bullets go through windows, gotta watch the words you choose
The AR got to jerkin', burned his hand and left a bruise
When them bodies start to drop, they screamin' "Stop, let's call a truce"
Fuck the other shit, I'm goin' for the win (fuckin' win)
