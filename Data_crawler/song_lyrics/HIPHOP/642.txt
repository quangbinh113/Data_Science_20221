Song Name: Brothers (feat. Luh Kel)
Ay, look
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change but I ain't gon' listen
She fuck with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
Screaming for love, lets just run up them digits
We talk for some years, I ain't talking 'bout minutes
Free my big brother, he stuck in the prison
You say you victim in playin', you mean it
You did some shit and I cannot forget it
Love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
Now that you got me my head always spinning
All of my friends they like "Hayden, you trippin'"
Like, damn
Why you do me like that?
How you do me like that?
How you do it like that?
I can't even call back
You just stabbed me in the back
Imma fall right back
But fuck it, it's all cap
Your brother is a bitch, my brothers, we all that
You actin' like a female you call me, I call back
I wanna make it outta my city and get back
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change but I ain't gon' listen
She fuck with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change but I ain't gon' listen
She fuck with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
Like, damn
Why you do me like that?
How you do me like that?
How you do it like that?
I can't even call back
You done stabbed me in the back
Imma fall right back (Imma fall right back)
Imma fall right back (Imma fall right back)
Yeah, I love all my brothers I feel like I'm needing you
Your body a drug, girl I feel for you
Think that you deadly, you think that I'm shady
You acting so crazy, it's me and you
Love, now I need it, girl, you gave me your love, now I'm feening
Got my heart broke but you picked up the pieces
Let be, don't go girl, I hate when you leavin'
Yeah, yeah
But girl it's whatever, just do what you wanna
We pop at the mall, we got Dolce and Gabbana
Your face on Beyonc√©, but body Rihanna
I love how you stunnin', you drippin' designer
God, I'm lucky but I'm know that they want ya
You got my heart I tell the truth feel like I can't lie
Call my phone and we can talk until the sunrise
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change but I ain't gon' listen
She fuck with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
