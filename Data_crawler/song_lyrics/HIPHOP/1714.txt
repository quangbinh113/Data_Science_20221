Song Name: Chokehold
Ay uh
"Section 8 just straight cooked this mf up"
Ay, Ay
In a choke hold
(In a choke hold)
Ay
Percocet got me in a chokehold
And it's not letting go
Lean got me in a chokehold
And it's not letting go
Shrooms got me in a chokehold
Addys got me in a chokehold
And they not letting go
This shit got me in a chokehold
It's not letting go
This shit got me in a chokehold
It's not letting go
No time soon
Why I couldn't love a bitch?
I put money first
Do them niggas bad first
They had the change
They'd do you worse
Ion shoot back nigga I shoot first
Ion think I'm from this universe
Bitch ask me why I do the percs
Said cus they'll never leave
Dog in my pedigree
Mama said lay with dogs you get fleas
Lay with me you get rich
Give me the keys to your heart bitch
Auto push to start the car
Can't come here we buy the bar
Know the lions roar
Caught her standing by my car
Can I get a piece of your Reece's bar
Baby badder than a toddler
But not my lil boy
She say she a cuddler and coddler
Fuckin in public don't get caught
Percocet that's my massager
Brain filled up with thoughts
House filled up with glocks
Ima Big Back my way to the top
He was just bap
That's how he got knocked
I'm kicking it in
Cus I don't knock
In love with Ben
Not no thot
I know my skin
A lil bit dark
Just like my cup
My adderal orange
Section 8 took the shrooms
And blended em up
You'll die if ya blick wasn't upped
In the sky you'll be visiting us
I had to give 'em a visual cus
I felt like this was a plus
Bitch said I'm too nonchalant
Another one kicking the dust
She play victim
Like for what
223's right by my gut
Fans said drop it Mr. Doorkicker
Once was a poor nigga
One door kicking nigga
When that perc kicked in
Know I just might float round this bitch
Amiri my coat round this bitch
Like when I grip her throat
Ain't that a bitch
Nigga just asked ain't that a switch
Can't get passed gotta get frisked
She wanna kiss me like we French
She suck dick behind these tints
Every month I pay her rent
Smoke big blunts the perc kicked in
Adderal focusing me in
And the shrooms make me grin
He seeing tombs and demons
He just jumped in the deep end
We was getting money nigga
Fuck friends
I was in the back seat of that Benz
It's like a track meet when we spin
Act like my brother but we ain't kin
And once again
Percocet got me in a chokehold
And it's not letting go
Lean got me in a chokehold
And it's not letting go
Shrooms got me in a chokehold
Addys got me in a chokehold
And they not letting go
In a choke hold
