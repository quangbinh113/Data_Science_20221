Monsta's gon' tear it up (yeah)

Convertible top do cartwheels
Booty so soft, it's all real
'Cause I'm eating real good like Garfield
I ain't stunting, you dust, got long bills

'Cause I am me
I am healthy, I am happy, just be my man, you ain't my daddy (no)
If I want it, I make it happen (I do), it's gon' get done, bitch, ain't no asking (no)
I get bands, but this ain't magic (yeah, ha)
I set trends, it's just a habit
Independent and I'm classy (yeah)

Don't need the hate, my back's to you (yeah)
You can keep your man, I'm cool (Flo Milli shit)
I'm too focused to tell the truth (wow)
When I count up them hundreds, they blue (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the shit on the internet too (hoe)
Spooking these bitches like boo, oops (what?)
I manifested a new coupe (yeah)
I know I'm young, but I get that money like I'm grown (money)
Look out for my mama and all my family back at home
Came up from napkins, now I get money from rapping
I get the front and the backend (hey)
My life is a caption (haha)
My Bimmer and Bentley is matching (um)
I write this shit off my taxes (yeah)
I am healthy, I am wealthy, I am rich, I am that bitch (yeah)
I am gonna go get that bag and I am not gonna take your shit (uh)
I am protected, well respected, I'm a queen, I'm a dream (yeah)
I do what I wanna do and I'm who I wanna be
'Cause I am me
Yeah, look in that mirror (look in that mirror)
Tell yourself everything that you wanna hear (what you wanna hear?)
Tell yourself that you that bitch and make that clear (make that shit clear)
Never stressin', never lack, ain't got no fears (ain't got no fears)
