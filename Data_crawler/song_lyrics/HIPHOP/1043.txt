Song Name: Time Heals
Ayo Keyz, chop this up, for the one time (hmm, hmm)
MarsGawd lit another one
It's Malik on the track
She say that I'm tripping, uh
I tell her how I'm feeling, she say that I'm trippin'
That's all you gon' say? (Question mark)
Tell me "Leave," then I'll leave, I'll get out of your way
Ayy, tell me why these niggas hatin', what the fuck is the word?
Chasin' after my dream been my only concern
I had gave you all my love and ain't get none in return
I kept dancin' with the devil, can't be mad I got burned
No, I won't cry 'bout it, I can't cry 'bout it
Heal my pain, I pull up in a new wide-body
With big cuz and he gone off them narcotics
Poisonous love is the only drug in my body
Starting to think it got a hold on me
Pain in my heart, it be controllin' me
I done looked inside the mirror and didn't notice me
These niggas hating, bitches faking, get 'em gone from me
Only the family niggas 'round 'cause my bread long
These niggas hating on a nigga, and they dead wrong
Tool, got his pistol in the party, these niggas head gone
To my left, I spot a redbone
And I know that she's fine
But I know that these girls are heartless (These girls are heartless)
Don't need love, I need me time (Me time)
Young, wild, and mad broken-hearted (Yeah)
Oh woah, oh (I need time)
Oh woah, oh (yeah)
Oh woah (yeah)
Where you been at?
I'd take it to your old number if it wasn't screened, shit (yeah)
What you say?
I said that he says that you're lookin' for me (yeah)
I think he'll go for that
Ain't no other phone (yeah)
I'm saying, that other number (uh-uh, you're trippin')
How'd you think I would feel? (Huh?)
And I know that she's fine
But I know that these girls are heartless
Don't want love, I need me time
Young, wild, and mad broken-hearted
Oh woah, oh
Oh woah, oh
Oh woah
Where you at? What you finna say? (Oh-oh)
Where you been at?
Hmm?
Where you been at?
Just been coolin'
Where you been at?
At home, at home
Okay
And you? Not doin' nothin'
What you doin' tomorrow?
And I know that she's fine
But I know that these girls are heartless
Don't want love, I need me time
Young, wild, and mad broken-hearted
Oh woah, woah, oh, woah, oh
Oh woah, woah, oh
Oh woah, oh-oh
