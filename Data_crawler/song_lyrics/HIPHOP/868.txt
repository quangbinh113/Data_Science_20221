Song Name: Welcome To Brixton
Yo, fi, like, what the hell man?
50 Cal mixed it
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
Brixton bully, slide with a bottie, man hold two from the woodie
Side roof gangsta, niggas know me, man leave two in your hoodie
My youngs ain't on nuttin', stay with the cut and chef up you and your mother
Free Owen, got nicked for a mazza, now he's doin' life in the slammer
How many times have I circled an op?
Like again and again 'til a man got slapped with a hammer (bow)
Brother was a well-known rider
I hop off her back, watch the ops and sing like Mariah (sing)
It was screw as s- to just slap that, gone when Hitchcock bun
Man ain't a liar, call, come, go, like Kia
Slap man live, I'm a well-known striker
Aim for the chest and higher
If I miss then watch miss back fat bulldog
Everything there get fry-up
B-b-bad B's come to the rack, I tell her young G's be gentle and line up
Vince got nicked with the holy for grub, threes bros and a well-known rider
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
I see bare man duckin' and divin', I crash just what I'm tryna leave heads bleedin'
I'm sick and tired of the skeetin', back fizz WAP, I see bare man breezin' (always)
Bro go circle the sh with the sh, somethin' got dropped in the evenin'
Bad B's come down south with the diva, ain't got Jimmy, I ain't beatin' (fuck 'em)
Slap out a man on the back row, look to my right I see my ex is preein' and screamin'
(Ay broski, just spin this whip, let me lean out the ride and crash out his whip)
For ops are quicks, fear get touched and talk to the pigs
Man got grabbed for aimin' the aim on a Friday
Man got slapped in the bin (bin, bin)
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
Welcome to Brxiton, I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
The kick-back mad on the spinna, seen 'nough man just run from my niggas
How they talk 'bout dingers? They ain't got dingers, they ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My little nigga ridin' loose with the chinga, mind you get done with your nigga (and again)
Welcome to Brixton
And I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
Welcome to Brixton
And I'm in the party with barbies and drillas
