Song Name: Porsches In The Rain
Ayy bruh, GPS sayin' 5min away
It's cool, it's good, pull up
Alright, bet
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
I talk to bro before I sleep at night
Before I sleep at night, he always told me grab the pipe
I heard it's money on my head, can't let them take my life
I keep a Glock up in the Porsche 'cause I ain't living right
It's two 40's on my hip and please don't make me flash
I trade the Audi for the Porsche 'cause it be goin' fast
It's YBN, bitch you know we all about the cash
If rappin' stop then you know we bringin' out the mash
It's 2 AM, with the poles, me and gang slide
Me and gang extortin' niggas, watch them niggas cry
I don't really play with niggas, play with me you die
Niggas sayin' that it's funk but they apologize
Steel plate, 50's and them K's, I let it spray
Think I'm playin', pumpin' in the club, they gon' spray the mace
Free Lil' Grim, we was on the block 'fore he caught a case
A nigga copped a Benz but I'm bringin' out the Porsche today
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
Ooh
Drop-top, two bitches in the studio gon' give top
New watch bust down, the AP, not the G-Shock
Bitch, I'm a pimp like Pinky
Wrist on water Fiji
Ooh, that bitch actin' bougie
But she still wear Bebe
Ooh, pull up and shop (shop)
Robbed the plug, spend a bag on a watch (watch)
That bitch a thot (bitch!)
She started choosin', walkin' round with the knots (walkin' round with a Glock)
Yeah, Gucci sandals (sandals)
I fucked your bitch in flip-flops (flip-flops)
My bitches bad, your bitch not
Kicked the bitch out, told her "Kick rocks!" (stupid bitch!)
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
We ridin' Porsches in the rain
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane
