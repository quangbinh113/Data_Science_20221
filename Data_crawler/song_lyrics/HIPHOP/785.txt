Song Name: Save Me (feat. YoungBoy Never Broke Again)
Yeah, we don't wanna do anything to scare the children
That's the last thing we wanna do
We don't wanna scare anybody
You are my, my eveâ€”, my everything
It's so hard to choose, but somehow, I chose you
I love you
Sho' 'nuff, sho' 'nuff, sho' 'nuff
Baby, you are my everything
Yeah, when people ask me for some money, I tell 'em get in line (Line)
Another funeral, I don't pay for all my nigga's dying
I got that PTSD [?], so all I hear is sirens
I text my nigga but I guess he [?], he ain't replyin'
Smile in your face, and when you turn your back, they stab your spine
I was [?] and [?] street like I'm legally blind
A tall nigga in the coupe, so I'm easy to find
She want Versace so I flew her out straight to Milan
It ain't no cappin' in my rap, you know you pussy need a peppin'
From the Southside, [?], I'm in my bag, I gotta say
Grown niggas get upset if I don't give 'em no money
But you ain't do nothin' to them niggas when they slid on your homies
I ain't savin' nobody unless she's here to stay
You know the thighs match the ass, ass match the waist (Woo)
You know the tires match the rims, rims match the Wraith (Yeah)
And if she loyal, then she spoiled, nigga, that's my babe
Oh, yeah
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Oh, come on)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Oh, come on now)
Now let me tell you 'bout that youngin' who fresh out prison (Out of prison)
Say he misguided, he be wildin', he just want attention (He want attention)
That nation business, I stand tall, so when you talk, I listen (I listen)
Then money talk, so I'm just hopin' I'm the one they mention (The one they mention)
Upgraded my swag, I walk on stage and still got case suspended (Case suspended, uh)
Roll with some hitters out Savannah, bangin' [?] and .6's (Neighborhood)
Look, my lil' niggas tote that hammer, no such thing as missin' (Bom-bah)
And plus, I'm fresh up out that slammer, I go hard, no quittin'
I bought that work, don't need no clout (Don't need no clout)
Bandana wrapped 'round that Glock, I'm posted on the block (I'm on the block)
Can't let nobody love myself, put all my feelings on the shelf
And I just need my nigga, I feel I don't need nobody else
Oh, yeah
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Oh, come on)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
You saved me
You saved me from myself
I don't need nobody else (Oh, come on now)
It's so hard to choose, but somehow, I chose you
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I love you
Sho' 'nuff, sho' 'nuff, sho' 'nuff
Baby, you are my everything
Respect it
It's so hard to choose, but somehow, I chose you
I love you
Oh, yeah
