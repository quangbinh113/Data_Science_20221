Song Name: Juggin
Used to be staircases and alleyways
Now it's big faces and one-aways
Now she wan' come, she wan' swallow me
Range Rover tint like limousine
Juggin', juggin', juggin' (yeah, yeah)
Them boy want war 'cah my man jook him
Them boy wan' talk when man not lookin' (woah, woah)
No problem, give me the money, yeah, yeah (yo)
Remember when I missed those calls
I had no white left
Six years, I sat in that cell
Where all that time went
Shit, I had to digest
Came up trappin', nеver tried F (nevеr)
Now it's Land Rover side steps
Shot up residence
Had to burn my clothes, it was evidence
Gotta rate the ting like the Americans
You know me, I stick with the metal
I'm like a magnet
Step with a rare and another one, DJ Khaled
I could tell you 'bout the wing
How the petrol bar sting
But I don't know
Why they act so hard and then they sing (Huh?)
My whipper lost it all in the pot, it was tekky
Pissed I couldn't get that white girl back, Chloe Ferry
If my life was a film, it'd be a horror
CPS tryna get me longer
But what don't kill me only make me stronger
I'm a G till they bury me, no stressin', G
Gyming with my Rollie on, this life's temporary
Used to be staircases and alleyways
Now it's big faces and one-aways
Now she wan' come, she wan' swallow me
Range Rover tint like limousine
Juggin', juggin', juggin'
Them boy want war 'cah my man jook him
Them boy wan' talk when man not lookin'
No problem, give me the money, yeah, yeah
Some girl say I'm horrible, some say adorable
Trap house scales and the sales are phenomenal
Laugh at these nerds 'cause their words are just comical
We're animals like Narnia and it's a chronicle
They're wasted
Whip coke in the basin
Straight back to the basics
Step back couple paces
'Cause, man, them straps are persuasive (yeah)
Three-sixty-five in
Mans creeping through these streets, hear the siren
Rocks getting paper, neat with the filing
Time's always money, so I'm sweet with the timing (yeah)
And it's time, start climbing
Big money pit, so just climb in (in)
She just whinin' (whinin')
Don't wanna hear it, it's just tiring (jeez)
Kick doors of an enemy
Floored it, scored with a penalty
Morpheus, bored of your energy
Sexy, I want more of the chemistry
Spacious, just dumb on space
Even winter, I had summer flake
I got two straps, let's double date
It's showtime, but it got run off stage
Used to be staircases and alleyways
Now it's big faces and one-aways
Now she wan' come, she wan' swallow me
Range Rover tint like limousine
Juggin', juggin', juggin'
Them boy want war 'cah my man jook him
Them boy wan' talk when man not lookin'
No problem, give me the money, yeah, yeah
