Song Name: Death Ain't Easy
Turn Me Up Josh
(Ayo, Vani)
(Ayy, Young Cutta, turn up)
Who told me death is easy?
Who told me death is easy?
Like why you leave me?
Why you tell me?
Why you tell me that death is easy?
They ain't bleed like we bleed
Sheroid was a cool nigga
A real nigga, not a stupid
I heard J-Money move loose with it
He the one that's at the roof with it
You think you tought, you got your clips extended
Been on my own, I'm finna independent
I love you too but I don't know your feelings
You ain't gotta tell me 'cause I know the difference
I wash my pain away with painkillers
No new friends, I'm with the same niggas
Came from nothin', you see what fame give us
They went to jail, took out the main niggas
Baby momma realer than some day ones
I gotta stash the drugs whenever they come
I made "Dis Ain't What U Want" inside the basement
Stayed alive inside the trenches, yeah, I made it
What's-his-name would've been around but he hate it
I fell off with my sound and they faded
Look at me now, I'm shittin' in they faces
Them billions close around, I can taste it
Bitches stealin' kids, they tryna take it out my testicles
I was fuckin' strippers, I was actin' unprofessional
Lookin' at my son and I tell him, "I'ma better you"
And that shit we doin', we get caught, we goin' federal
I won't say it no more, you get Dior, you actin' sexual
All the opps unhealthy but I know a couple vegetable
Leave me alone, I don't wanna talk anymore
And I found myself, I ain't feelin' lost no more
Good weed with the cold, don't make me cough no more
The reason niggas dyin', it ain't my fault no more
He on 11's block, he not about it no more
He died off the pill, he don't wanna pop no more
Who told me death is easy?
Who told me death is easy?
Like why you leave me?
Why you tell me?
Why you tell me that death is easy?
They ain't bleed like we bleed
They ain't bleed like we bleed
They ain't bleed like we bleed
