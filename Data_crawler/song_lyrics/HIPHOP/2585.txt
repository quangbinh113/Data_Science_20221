Song Name: SOHO HOUSE (feat. Hello O'shay)
Tell me you ain't gotta go
Tell me you don't want to leave me
Tell me you ain't gotta work
Tell me you just want to see me
Tell me what you want to share
Heard your mama want to meet me
Run my fingers through your hair
Rap sweet, nothing's in your ear, yeah
Brunch in the Stuy, see the glimmer in your eyes
It ain't even 'bout the sex, I'ma get up with your mind
I just wanna take it slow 'cause I'm feeling you for real
And whenever we go fast, it be fuckin' up the vibe
I'ma keep it real, real, I ain't fuckin' with your time
I just wanna eat good, laugh hard, have bars
Do a one-two step on a hot dance floor
You backin' that thing on the kid, oh shit
Shorty fun, we could talk shit until the sun come
Hit a party with our loved ones and get lost in this rum punch
Get a lift 'cause we dumb drunk and I'ma drop you off at one, hon'
And if you tryna let me up for some dessert, I'ma eat it 'til the crumbs done
Shorty treat me like I'm someone
Stay a hundred, never front none
Keep cool
'Cause we livin' out a summer in New York, and she know
I'm a native, they show love where I go
On the playlist, SoHo House is my go-to
Tell me you ain't gotta go
Tell me you don't want to leave me
Tell me you ain't gotta work
Tell me you just want to see me
Tell me what you want to share
Heard your mama want to meet me
Run my fingers through your hair
Rap sweet, nothing's in your ear, yeah
Nothing serious, mutually curious
Left a situation that was toxic, and I'm honestly good
Because I know what I'm worth and, shit, I know what I bring
So I rushin' into nothin' 'til it's somethin' I could bring home
To Lil Kota and my dukes
'Til then, shit, I think it's sweeter than dry fruit
And I ain't tryna feed you any raps that's not true
This is real life, I ain't here for the top news
We could love Jones in the park or the bar
Or the car or the food to a roof with a view
It's a good time
Seem like she don't wanna say goodbye
And that's good
'Cause we livin' out a summer in New York, and she know
I'm a native, they show love where I go
On the playlist, SoHo House is my go-to
Tell me you ain't gotta go
Tell me you don't want to leave me
Tell me you ain't gotta work
Tell me you just want to see me
Tell me what you want to share
Heard your mama want to meet me
Run my fingers through your hair
Rap sweet, nothing's in your ear, yeah
Dumbo, Cali, fly out to Miami
Berlin, baby, I don't think you understand me
We could take a trip, say the word, we could dip
We was tryin' to survive, now we learnin' how to live
And it's perfect just the way it is
Take you out 'cause you deserve it
We can be friends in the end
I ain't searchin'
I'm just tryna look good, feel good, work it
Baby, I'm worth it
And you are too, I see the glow and the nuance cool
I ain't finna let a bad bitch obscure my view
Because it's all about us, won't you be my muse?
What we really got to prove or lose?
'Cause we livin' out a summer in New York, and she know
I'm a native, they show love where I go
On the playlist, SoHo House is my go-to
Tell me you ain't gotta go
Tell me you don't want to leave me
Tell me you ain't gotta work
Tell me you just want to see me
Tell me what you want to share
Heard your mama want to meet me
Run my fingers through your hair
Rap sweet, nothing's in your ear, yeah
