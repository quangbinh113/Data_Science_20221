Song Name: when we were 16
Ayy, I fell in love when I was 16
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
She had a hard time at home, and words were unsaid
I fell in love when I was 16
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
I wish I helped you out, I could have held your hand
Yeah, everybody told you to leave, get away, girl
Said I'm turning into the person you hate, girl
Started throwing fits, getting up on my face, girl
Then you threw a fist, it was more than a phase, girl
In a place, you could never get out of
Inside, you were fighting the outcome
Lot of thoughts that I wish you could outrun
But it all caught up and you're now gone
(Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand)
(Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand)
(Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand)
(Stay with me, why'd you leave?)
Yeah, I fell in love when I was 16
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
She had a hard time at home, and words were unsaid
I fell in love when I was 16
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
I wish I helped you out; I could have held you're (damn)
I fell in love when I was 16
And we always talked about our big dreams
But next thing I knew, she's gone, I'm lonely
Yeah, she took her life to be with the old me
I'm sorry, girl, I'm sorry
Too much pain, getting drunk every party
I've been feeling off like the pause in my heartbeat
Girl, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
Ayy, yeah, sorry, I'm a bag of shit
I find that my eyes didn't read the script
I didn't get the hints, I didn't see your hurt
Now you up in heaven, and I'm stuck on earth
I hate your mom for leaving you at home
Only you and your dad with his alcohol
Walk home from school, a new girl in your house
Drugs on the table and your dad on the couch
My girlfriend left and never left me clues
Didn't know this before, now I know from the news
I wish I had the power to go back in time
I would punch your dad and make sure you're fine
I would cut that rope and show you I care
Jeez, I miss your face and that cute green stare
When I close my eye, I can see you there
In the empty room with a fallen chair
Looking back, I was too young
No, I didn't understand
I wish that I could save you now
Ayy, sorry that I can't
I know I'm not to blame
But I know I could have helped
Maybe you wouldn't be gone
If I just asked you how you felt
