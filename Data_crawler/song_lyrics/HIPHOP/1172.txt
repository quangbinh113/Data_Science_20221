Song Name: U Are My High (with Future)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (on you)
All these girls in the club (Pluto), I got my eyes on you (Hendrix)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (DJ Snake)
All these girls in the club (Freebandz Gang), I got my eyes on you
You, you are my high
Did we really love you? You are my high
Did we really love you?
I needed space, baby, go out to space, baby (high)
I'ma need space, baby, I'm going out to space, baby
Baby, I need you arrogant, I need you confident
I need your promises, baby (high)
I've been searching for the right one (you, we love you)
Introduce you to Jimmy Choo shoes
Happy belated, eh?
Check the commodity (high), hottest commodities
Biggest whoever, whenever
She the baddest in the city
Know what comin' wit' it
Stackin' the liberty, taller than Statue of Liberty (you, we love you)
Hand you the Benz key, hand you the Lamborghini (you)
You renovating, physically, spiritually
I'm tryin' to love you, tryin' to boost your confidence (we love)
I'm tryin' to spoil you, girl, put the big rocks on a seven figure
Bubble bath in the 'tub, I see you, I see you (Pluto)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (we love you)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (you are my high)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (did we love you?)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (you are my high)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (did we really love you?)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you (you are my high)
All these girls in the club, I got my eyes on you
Did we really love you? You are my high
Did we really love you? You are my high
Did we really love you? You are my high
Did we really love you? You are my high
Did we really love you?
All these girls in the club, all I see is you, all I see is you
Bubble bath in the 'tub, I see you, I see you
All these girls in the club, all I see is you, all I see is you
Bubble bath in the 'tub, I see you, I see you
Strung out on these days and money (high)
Strung out on bad bitches and money (did we really love you?)
Strung out on bad bitches and money, honey (high)
Strung out on bad bitches and money (did)
