Song Name: Like This
'Mello made it right
I been through too much just to live like this
Double up my cup, you can't sip like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this
Now I won't give a fuck, let it rip like this
Hop up in my truck and I whip like this
And now they know I'm up 'cause my wrist like this
No, I can't get enough 'cause I'm sick like this, yeah
I been through too much just to live like this
I been through too much just to live like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
I been through too much just to live like this
Copped another Rollie, but it ain't a Plain Jane
Niggas call the police, but be screamin', "Gang, gang"
Boy, stop actin' like you know me when you know you can't hang
That's my brother, not my homie, nah, that ain't the same thing
And for Busta, I'm gon ride, 'cause we feel the same pain
Like no other, do or die even when the days rain
From the gutter, that's no lie, we on the same page
From the bottom, now we ballin' like Dwayne Wade
I been through too much just to live like this
Double up my cup, you can't sip like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this
I been through too much just to live like this
I been through too much just to live like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
I been through too much just to live like this
Phone ring, I decline it, I don't know why they whinin'
I ain't ask them to chime in, real niggas move in silence
Amiri jeans and Balenciagas
Always believed in our dreams, now we got them dollars
If you ain't pleased, baby, please, tell me what's the problem
Yeah, I'm a fiend for the cream like a Baskin-Robbin
Now, just don't leave me in the street 'cause I'll go back to robbin'
This for the team, ain't have a thing, and now we got it poppin'
I been through too much just to live like this
Double up my cup, you can't sip like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this
Now I won't give a fuck, let it rip like this
Hop up in my truck and I whip like this
And now they know I'm up 'cause my wrist like this
No, I can't get enough 'cause I'm sick like this, yeah
I been through too much just to live like this
I been through too much just to live like this
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed, so they fit like this
I been through too much just to live like this
Like this, like this
Like this, like this
Like this, like this
Ooh, no, yeah
