Song Name: Mixed Personalities (feat. Kanye West)
Because I am hard, you will not like me
Say you want someone
Say you want someone
Said you want someone
Say you want someone
I think I got mixed personalities
This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she mad at me
Say you want someone that'll love you
Someone who could please you
Someone who can kiss on and rub you
Fuck you like this, fuck you like that
Oh, now, I got mixed personalities
She got me stressing, singing melodies
For her, I swear I'd catch a felony
Oh, Penelope
Say you want someone
Say you want someone
Said you want someone
Said you want someone
I swear to God, this girl be tripping dawg
One day she Blooded, then she cripping, dawg
You know I put it in the kittens, dawg
She screaming out, she need some lifting, aw
She blocking, ignoring my calls
(Blocking, ignoring my calls)
She keep on blocking, ignoring my calls
(Blocking, ignoring my calls)
I'm all inside her, I'll knock down her walls
(Knock 'em down, boom)
This bitch is hyper, need some Adderall (Oh, no)
I think I got mixed personalities
This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she mad at me
Say you want someone that'll love you
Someone who could please you
Someone who can kiss on and rub you
Fuck you like this, fuck you like that
Oh, Lord, I ain't never been here before, oh, no
Oh, keep pressing ignore, oh, no
She keep ignoring my calls and blocking me everything
Bitch, oh, no
Oh, and it's my fault, mmm
I got the keys to the lil' bitch heart and you can't get the vault (Yeah)
Better go get a locksmith, better go get your Glock, bitch
Pull up on mothafuckin' opp if he playing with my Slime
That's my boo, that's my Slime, that's my everything (Everything)
That's my bitch forever, don't need no wedding ring (Wedding ring)
I'll give her the world, polka dots on her new pajamas
Take the bitch out to Behamas, let the ho eat at Benihana (Benihana)
Matter of fact, ain't tryna meet your mama (Meet her mama)
Dick her down, that the other way (All the way)
Dick her down, yeah, the other way (Right way)
Dick her down, yeah, the Thugger way (Thugger way)
Knocking on your door (Door), tryna give your love (Love, love)
You keep telling me (Love), you don't give a fuck (Fuck, fuck)
You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, babe
You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, babe
You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, babe
Young Nigga World and I got the young nigga wave
