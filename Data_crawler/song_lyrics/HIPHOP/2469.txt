Song Name: WHOLE LOTTA MONEY
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker (BIA, BIA)
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
Ain't no came in with no broke shit, that broke shit get old
Ain't no came in with no hoe shit, the hoe get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe bright, just to match with my toes
Yeah
I can't wear the shit you bitches wear 'cause it's cheap to me
It's some money at my table, grab a seat with me
Cost a ticket just to cover all my legal fees
I don't hang with jealous bitches, that's a weak disease
Hoe don't run up
If you broke and in my business, thеn just shut up (shh)
I invested in my body bitch, I'm done up
I look good, I likе to fuck him when the sun up (oh)
I put all my jewellery just to go to the bodega
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch I'm getting money, get the fuck up outta here
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
Ain't no came in with no broke shit, that broke shit get old
Ain't no came in with no hoe shit, the hoe get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe bright, just to match with my toes
White on white Bentley
Trunk out the engine
Hoe tryna get near me
Bitch, stay up outta my mentions
Thinking 'bout got plenty
20 racks and Fendi
Got time for these messy hoes in my bussiness, I ain't with it
Got right now, not next
Need M's on all of my checks
Don't worry 'bout who I text
Just know it ain't my ex
Lotta rich niggas in here
No bitch niggas in here
Want a packland and a check clear, and then that's what you hear (ah)
I put all my jewellery just to go to the bodega
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch I'm getting money, get the fuck up outta here
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
Ain't no came in with no broke shit, that broke shit get old
Ain't no came in with no hoe shit, the hoe get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe bright, just to match with my toes
BIA, BIA
