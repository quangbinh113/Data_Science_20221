Tired of niggas cappin' (tired of niggas cappin')
Trap House Mob
Niggas frontin' their jewels (yeah, this is a Melo beat)

Okay, okay (I see it)
Okay, okay
Look, you cannot say Pop and forget the Smoke (yeah)
I'm from the Floss where niggas tote (woah)
They couldn't be Crips, so they turned Folks (bah)
Drivin' through the 'Ville, droppin' the cho (brr)
I gotta laugh, 'cause these niggas jokes
Dread like, "Who these niggas?" (Who these niggas?)

Me and Trey, that's four choppers (woo)
Man down (woo), all you see is helicopters (grr)
Paramedics pick him up, they gon' send him to the doctor (get that nigga)
I'm in the hood like an engine, revvin' (Trey, get that nigga)
My checks is clearin' (woo, woo), your checks is pending (woo, woo)
And I got a couple gangstas, let me know (it's a fact)
If you want smoke (if you want smoke)
'Cause, boy, I can send 'em (boy, I can send 'em)
And I got a bad bitch, ass up
Face down (face down), yeah, she love doggy style (uh-huh)
And she got a Louis bag (yeah), that hold the extendo (woo, woo)

Got it jumpin out the zoo, seein' red, seein' blue (yeah)
Young La Flame, how it moves, Pop Flare how it- (woo)
Bring my hands out, try to hide my face
Duck away, she wanna lay up and hibernate (yeah)
I took a chance, it's a lot to take
I took a right, ended up right away (straight up)
She need a chunk, not a piece (alright)
It cost me three for the keys (keys)
Not the work but the V
She let it twirl to the beat
I send the work, bet it reach (reach)
Wearin' pearls, expensive beads (beads)
I only hurl at my peeps (it's lit)
Cuts, diamond cuts, out in public
Two cups of the stuff, now I'm up
Coco Chanel when she tuck it
We bunk, get a nut (nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
My bitch love coco (haha)
Woo back, baby (woo back, baby)
Woo

Okay, okay (I see it)
Okay, okay (turn around)
My bitch love coco (haha)
Woo back, baby (woo back, baby)
