Uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Yeah, man, fuck all these niggas hatin' on me (yeah)
Yesterday, I fucked a waitress, I came outside with my plate, she was waitin' on me
And y'all ain't talkin' 'bout shit, she be tellin' me to smile when she ride my dick
Young niggas goin' wild, keep beggin' for a hit
He be sayin', "Don't argue, big bruh, put some paper on it" (go!)
Niggas worryin' 'bout who greater, these niggas barely be makin' a play-in
I'm in the playoffs, I brought ya bae in
Hoe-ass niggas goin' out like the Lakers, haters
Hatin' nigga, keep lookin', rookie
I'm pullin' up like Booker, pussy
Put that shit on my back like a throwback
Play with me 'cause I rap, get a toe tag
Yeah, nigga, I'm havin' more racks, this shit on the floor like a doormat
Yeah, we gon' fuck on the floor, she gon' throw back
Yeah, 'bout to pull out a wig, need some more tracks
What I payed for the crib? Nigga, don't ask
Just know that I own it, nigga
Glock with a switch, out with ya bitch
Fuck around me, be ready
I'm tellin' you, I'm on it, nigga
(It's Baby, they better be ready, I'm tellin' you)
Man, fuck all these niggas hatin' on me (yeah)
Yesterday, I fucked the waitress, I came outside with my plate, she was waitin' on me (Let's go)
And y'all ain't talkin' 'bout shit, she be tellin' me to smile when she ride my dick
Young niggas goin' wild, keep beggin' for a hit
He be sayin', "Don't argue, big bro, put some paper on me"
Y'all niggas better be ready for me
You ain't gotta be scared, just be ready (bitch)
DMX done played in Belly
I got that heat out, I go Armageddon
I ain't too rich to eat leftovers
Just told my B'M' to heat up a plate of spaghetti
I tried to back up the Maybach
But it was too close to the Lambo', the shit didn't let me
I got that fire in my right pocket
I got that rod in my left pocket (I got it, hoo)
I'm not no boy, I'm gon' step harder (yeah)
Beat yo' lil' ass like yo' stepfather (go)
I'm on the road, bitch, I'm way better (way)
I fuck the same hoes as Floyd Mayweather (uh)
I hop on the road and go make cheddar
She ate on my pole 'cause I taste better
Like mmm, mmm, mmm, nigga
Man, fuck all these niggas hatin' on me (yeah)
Yesterday, I fucked a waitress, I came outside with my plate, she was waitin' on me (let's go)
And y'all ain't talkin' 'bout shit, she be tellin' me to smile when she ride my dick (yeah)
Young nigga goin' wild, keep beggin' for a hit
He be sayin', "Don't argue, big bruh, put some paper on it"
Bitch, huh
Fuck all these niggas hatin' on me
Go
