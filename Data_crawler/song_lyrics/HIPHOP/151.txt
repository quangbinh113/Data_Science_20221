Song Name: Train food
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost
So I took a different path, in the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessing his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessing he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approaches casual, we talk 'bout self-harming
He told me "kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "how far are you from home?"
I said, "maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, I-
You ever woke up on a train track
With no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Trying to scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody coming, so you scream on
And scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you?
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout the diamond chain and the Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself the final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time is finally up
