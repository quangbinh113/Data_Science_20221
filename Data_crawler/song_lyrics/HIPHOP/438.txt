Song Name: Gone For The Summer (feat. A Boogie wit da Hoodie)
It's Jaye R
Gone for the summer, I
You really buggin' out

Gone for the summer, I
Gone for the summer, yeah
Gone for the summer
Gone for the summer, gone for
Gone for the summer, I
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
Came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
Gone for the summer, I
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
I came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
I never brag how real I keep it
That's my best secret
Nowadays they'll prolly leak it
Just because you peep it, that don't mean you gotta speak it
They say the ones who creep is comin' when you at your weakest
I think I heard that on "Goodfellas"
You make it out, now the hood jealous
Stay on your toes like a foot fetish
We go back to bacon, egg and cheeses at the hood deli
And when I did the butter rolls I never put jelly
No jealousy over no bread, yeah
Hope that ain't go over your head
That's word to Casanova, birds be gassed up over
You askin' where they from, they actin' like you ask them over
See, hoes think we all tryna bend their asses over
But if the shoe fits, wear it with your Fashion Nova
Look, once you corny then you stay corny
And once it's fuck you, I'ma stay horny
Gone (Gone)
Gone for the summer, I
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
Came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
Gone for the summer, I
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
I came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
Let's keep it a hunnid, even Benjamin got a big head
Money changes small faces into big heads
We was doin' smalls 'til we got big bread
Two words, "I'm gone" like Big said
Everybody got a story to tell
And everybody on this Earth is one story from Hell
One story from Heaven, another story from reverends
Always gone too soon, put the story together
Put the A to the K, put the 4 to the 7
For the bread get blown out of your Jordan 11's
Good times becomin' a new story or seven
Then it's damn, damn, damn, Florida Evans
You just say what you did, so your story alleged
20 years I did it, so my story is legend
Don't want no beef, all your stories is veggie
Heard 'bout my shooters, all the stories is Reggie
Miller
Gone for the summer, I
(NY Killer)
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
Came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
Gone for the summer, I
Spent over a hunnid thousand
You really buggin' out
Thinkin' I can't be without you
Gone for the summer now
I came back with two hunnid thousand
Shootouts in the summertime
I was really around it
Yo this might've been my coldest summer ever
Sometime you feel cold even in the summer weather
Sometime the dumb shit will make you come with something clever
Sometime it gotta fall apart just to come together
Life get puzzlin' but I made the pieces fit
Try to pull my card but I made them pieces hit
Never let you assholes make me a piece of shit
Could've went to war but I made my peace with it
Watch out who you pizza with
'Cause everybody want a slice of the pie
But they won't sacrifice for this fly
Told niggas life's a gamble, gotta roll the dice 'til you die
And it cost to be the boss, guess the price was too high
They ain't pay attention (Paid attention)
Teams break up over player tension
You ain't ready, gotta play the bench then
VP's are playin' drenched in
Ice water bath,
Jeweler put my name in script, that's a ice autograph, nigga
Cold summer with the pristine boys
And that black and orange ride, fright fest thing boy
Richard Millie rose gold on my left wing, boy
Plain Jane ain't the flex, I'm investing, boy
Gotta switch it up, on to the next thing, boy
You wearing throwbacks, that's Mitchell & Ness thing, boy
Lookin' like you wouldn't pass a diamond test thing, boy
That shit fake in your ring, fuck you wrestling, boy? (Wrestling, boy)
You gotta take it in blood
And that's just how you feel when you make it from mud, my nigga
Objections you could take to the judge
I'm a grinder, not the one that break up the buzz, my nigga
If you steal me, you gotta kill me
Any real G gotta feel me
See the chill me, that's the real me
But when you force my hand I'ma play the cards you deal me
Then I'm gone for the summer (Summer)
Then I'm gone for the summer (Summer)
I'm gone for the summer (Summer)
