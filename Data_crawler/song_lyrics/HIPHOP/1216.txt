Song Name: no way (feat. Jamie Foxx)
Can't trust that bitch, no way, no way, no way, no
Got a young nigga lit
I just turned 22 in Turks and Caicos
I got a little problem with tellin' the truth to her
She say I be too annoyin', I put Chanel on the hoe
I gotta buy her the whole damn Chanel store
Bussin' these fits since a lil' boy
Ayy, mix the J's with the double C, you know what I mean?
I'm in a daze, all of this cash got me feel like I'm in a dream
You know I'm supreme
I got family ties like I'm K-Dot and Baby Keem
I got bitches that know what I mean
Toot her up and I fuck on the ting
No way, no way, no way, no way
I ain't never go behind your back
I gotta stand tall and tell you to your face
And I hold it close when a nigga embracing
I don't ever gotta chase it
I don't ever gotta talk, came from the pavement
I was always granny's favorite
Got too many Richard Milles to ever have time for a lil' bitty bitch
Got too many plugs in the streets to ever walk around without a stick
Got too many hoes that never have a lil' shorty on top of the dick
Got too many life expenses to ever stop popping my shit
Can't trust that bitch, no way, no way, no way, no
Got a young nigga lit
I just turned 22 in Turks and Caicos
I got a little problem with tellin' the truth to her
She say I be too annoyin', I put Chanel on the hoe
I gotta buy her the whole damn Chanel store
Bussin' these fits since a lil' boy
Ayy, been bussin' these bitches since a lil' boy
I'm a big dog and a lil' boy
I know you're hearin' me lil' boy
But, you can't see me lil'-
Wockesha don't do me no justice, I need red
That bitch don't do me no justice if she don't give head
That bitch don't do me no justice if she don't find bread
I got niggas in the Bay that be on the 49 with the motherfuckin' nine
I got niggas that's on the fort yard, went four times, on this fifth time
Ever seen snake turn to a rat like 6ix9ine?
Got a Rolls-Royce with the thick back and I got a bitch, thick spine
Put a green beam on lil' Glock, best believe I'ma get mine
Can't trust that bitch, no way, no way, no way, no
Got a young nigga lit
I just turned 22 in Turks and Caicos
I got a little problem with tellin' the truth to her
She say I be too annoyin', I put Chanel on the ho
I gotta buy her the whole damn Chanel store
Bussin' these fits since a lil' boy
Ayy, been bussin' these bitches since a lil' boy
I'm a big dog and a lil' boy
I know you're hearin' me lil' boy
But, you can't see me lil'-
Roddy, what up, baby? It's J. Foxx
You killin' 'em, man
Ayy, listen, now, I know this album is called LIVE LIFE FAST
But, you know what I'm seein'?
I don't think these young cats out here really know how to slow it down
You know like-like-like me and Ye did it back in the day
I mean, I don't think these motherfuckers know about
Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, or-or-or little Anita
So, right here, Roddy, I think you should do is slow that shit down, man
And set this motherfucker off right
