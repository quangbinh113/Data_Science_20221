Song Name: Time Today
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
F- it, I'm crossin' the line today
The hate be so real, the love be fake
Be bumpin' they gums and bumpin' my tape
Don't go against me then ask for my help
Go get out your feelings and get it yourself
Might got the same shoes but you ain't gon' step (nope)
The sh- that you just put out, you could've kept, yep
She got a n-, he gotta share (why?)
You can't compete when you can't compare (period)
She ate the d-through my underwеar (uh)
Got up and got herself outta therе
I see they put me on memes and things
Don't speak on my life without knowin' the real
Eight figures a year, what it cost me to live
Don't hold it, just say what you feel but
Watch your mouth 'fore I fly out your b- (where?)
To a place that she didn't know exist (gone)
Mediterranean, water my wrist (bitch)
Keeping 'em pissed, how I'm talkin' my sh-
Six-figure check for a show, man I'm lit (lit)
Let's celebrate now my bag legit (go)
These n- with me with whatever I'm with (yeah)
Didn't know who did it, got everybody hit, b- (brr)
I don't like n-, I don't like b-
I don't like nobody (nobody, nobody)
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial
How you wanna go 'bout it? (How you wanna do it?)
I don't backtrack, man, f- that
I don't miss nobody (I don't miss nothin')
Left it on seen, I ain't write back, I don't trust nobody (period)
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
F- it, I'm crossin' the line today
These b-'ll cry and be lyin' in your face (facts)
Slicker than us, gotta know how they play
If the money wasn't straight, she wouldn't be here today
Ain't it man, sure know what to say
You ain't me so it's hard to relate (what?)
How much cash I f- off every day? (Big Bagg)
Don't play with me, baby, go play with your p-
You seen him in person these n- be shooken
A huncho it cost you a Quavo to book me
I'm worth it, the proof in the pudding
Surrounded by b- (four of 'em)
I'm lookin' like William but that ain't my girlfriends (nah)
Bruh, I'ma spin on your block
Back to back when I finish it, look like the world end (dawg)
I ain't ask for it, they did it to me (what?)
N- exposin' they hands for free
Get caught in the middle, that's bullseye (get it, too)
You got hit but we was targetin' he (him)
Poppin' my sh- with a capital P (caps)
SRT, Redeye, red key (vroom)
Might be ugly but my b- precious (bad)
She ain't even sneeze but still I bless her (achoo)
I don't like n-, I don't like b-
I don't like nobody (nobody, nobody)
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial
How you wanna go 'bout it? (How you wanna do it?)
I don't backtrack, man, f- that
I don't miss nobody (I don't miss nothin')
Left it on seen, I ain't write back, I don't trust nobody (period)
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
F- it, I'm crossin' the line today

I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
F- it, I'm crossin' the line today

I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
F- it, I'm crossin' the line today
