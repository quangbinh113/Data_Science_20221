Song Name: Mr. Glock
They got me fucked up
Aye I'm right back on they ass
They done made me mad
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash
I been getting bag after bag after bag
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit, these bitches coming in a pack
All these niggas pussy cash straight cow
Cat in hat, yeah baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack
Yeah and that's a motherfucking fact
Never leave the house without my motherfucking strap
I was 14 years old with that motherfucking sack
I don't fuck with none of these rappers, they know that
Aye I'm right back on they ass
They done made me mad
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash
I been getting bag after bag after bag
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit, these bitches coming in a pack
All these niggas pussy cash straight cow
Cat in hat, baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack
Smoking mack with my uncle, call it thrax
Yeah I was 13 sneaking, geeking, drinking Actavis
A couple niggas play with us
We turned that ass to dust
Don't let them gas you up
Heart cold, no mask or gloves nigga
Hit yo ass up with some slugs
I run with hustlers and thugs
I got this shit out the mud nigga
Aye who want smoke, I got bud
Strapped in the church and the club
What the fuck you niggas thought this was
Aye I'm right back on they ass
They done made me mad
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash
I been getting bag after bag after bag
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit, these bitches coming in a pack
All these niggas pussy cash straight cow
Cat in hat, yeah baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack
I love you Mr. Glock!
I love you too
