Let me tell you a little story about this side (this side)
You really can't make it on this side (this side)
Lot of lone stars on this side (this side)
I feel a lot at home on this side (ooh)
Ball 'til we fall on this side (ooh)
Lit late night on this side (ooh)
You never come around past midnight (ooh)
You miss everything on this side
This side (this side), this side (this side)
This side, this side, this side, this side (uh)
This side (woo), this side (ooh)
This side, this side, yeah
I made a lot of money on this side (ooh)
Lost a lot of money on this side (ooh)
Had my first kiss on this side (ooh)
Learned a lot of shit about this side (ooh)
Lately I been thinking 'bout this side (ooh)
Tryna get back on this side (ooh)
Tryna get back what's been mine (ooh)
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights (late nights)
Shit we used to do around midnight (midnight)
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight (shit tight)
Doin' all the drugs, had to get right (get right)
If I could get my partner back it would be nice (be nice)
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice (shoot the one)
He was too involved with the street life (street life)
Only way to live on this side (this side)
This side (this side), this side (this side)
This side, this side, this side, this side (oh)
This side (this side), this side (oh)
This side, this side, this side (Migo!)
Young rich nigga from the Nawfside
Paid my dues on this side
Flippin' the bricks on this side
I made it out the hood, I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side (this side)
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side (this side)
Look at my diamonds, don't get blind (don't get blind)
You better handcuff your hoe with a zip tie (cuff)
'Cause we'll take her, bust her down on this side (woo)
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom and now I'm on top, that's phenomenal (phenomenal)
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I did not make it, I wonder where I would go (oh!)
This side, this side (this side), this side (uh)
Graduated from the midget (woah)
This the life I was livin' (woah)
Graduated to a million (woah)
It's the money that I'm gettin' (woah)
Graduated from a hotbox
Now I'm ridin' 'round in a Bentley (skrrt, skrrt)
This how we do it on
This side, this side (woo), this side (uh)
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side
That's right, that's right
You never come around past midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean poured right
Just right, on this side
Find everything you need, everything you need on this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
