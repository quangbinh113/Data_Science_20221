Song Name: Paradise
Woah, oh, oh-oh
Nights filled with rum and coke
I'm a sinner in the flesh
Make decisions that are dumb, but it's fuck it now
Do what I want (yeah), spend it how I like (like)
Always get it back, nigga, I'ma live my life
I get lost in paradise
See me getting high, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I'm flyer than a kite
Making sure that I'ma get it right
They see me takin' flight, go
And now I'm rocking all this ice cold
I don't need a franc, got a milli in the bank
Soaking up the sun, I'm a number one rank, yeah, yeah
(Woah) yeah, summer times, woah
Good vibes, never tired, I'ma keep my shine
Shawty so divine, wanna make her mine
But she a trick, playing on me 'cause I'm rich
Take a flick, all this money on me stick
Gave her dick, now she walking 'round with a limp
All this money on me let it fall, it's mine
Hit it out of time of my life, but it takes time
Hundred thousand, hit the bank, yeah, I'ma stack it right
I hear these niggas talking, pull up we can have a fight
Nights filled with rum and coke
I'm a sinner in the flesh
Make decisions that are dumb, but it's fuck it now
Do what I want (yeah), spend it how I like (like)
Always get it back, nigga, I'ma live my life
Nights filled with rum and coke
I'm a sinner in the flesh
Make decisions that are dumb, but it's fuck it now
Do what I want (yeah), spend it how I like (like)
Always get it back, nigga, I'ma live my life
I get lost in paradise
See me getting high, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I'm flyer than a kite
Making sure that I'ma get it right
They see me takin' flight, go
And now I'm rocking all this ice cold
