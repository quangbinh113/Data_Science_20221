Song Name: The Moment
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist, frozen, I don't care (yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holdin', man's gone clear (oh)
I'm comin' to own like Romans
This my moment, zero fear
Oh my God, I feel amazing (oh)
Running up the numbers with my feed (with my feed)
My disease is going viral (oh)
Yeah, trust me, I'ma sicko when we meet (when I see you)
Beefin' like it's 13-37
Now they know that if I enter, I'm elite (I'm on top, man)
And I like it when it's cold (so cold)
Rocky diamonds at it ASAP
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist frozen, I don't care (yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holdin', man's gone clear (oh)
I'm comin' to own like romans
This my moment, zero fear
Yeah, situated in my own lane
I'm not in it for the one time
Snowpiercer, my train
Always on the go
My shit so cold, I'm eskimo
I need an igloo for my shindu and then add a double O
Show me the money, 'cause I'm not a liar (no)
I'm on my Jerry Maguire (what?)
I on the up, like a wheelie
Shakin' when comin' to see me
My team all over the map
Givin' and givin' and doin' it freely (on the map)
You might not fall in the cap
I'm so ahead, like I'm wearin' a beanie (ayy, ayy)
Love it, karma
Private charter
Movin' easy
Losin', na-na
She hate all the money I waste
Still wrappin' a brick in a lace
She likin' the way that I'm Poutin
Ridin' the ting like it's Odin
Won't you ride again
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist frozen, I don't care (yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holdin', man's gone clear (gone clear)
I'm comin' to own like Romans
This my moment, zero fear
