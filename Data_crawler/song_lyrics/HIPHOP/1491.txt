Song Name: Ryte Night
Who made this shit?
TayTay made the beat
For real flexin', let's go, woah, go
Boss, go, real big boss, go
Believe that bitch nigga
Nighttime, I'm up at the right time, uh, uh
Sewer damage, I say he get piped now
Demon baby, killin' shit on sight now
Money crazy, stay with least a hunnid thousand
Loaded, nigga know I'm in his bitch just like I'm Ben Fields (yeah)
Straight out them trenches but I still be with that shit still
I'm out the roof, I'm steady bootin'
I'm off of three pills
Like, bitch, you sleep, get left deceased, you know it's been real
Channel 2, bodies gettin' stepped on (gettin' stepped on)
The joke's on you, you diss, now you gettin' repped on
She a trap bitch, she know how to change tones (yeah)
Real grave diggas doin' contracts off the same phone
What the knowledge is, bust a check in his dome
Fuck how them coppers feel, stick any one I left, uh
Get put up when I'm stayin' down, don't kill 'em with the city state
But I'm gon' let 'em slide
I'm just gon' catch him and stomp in his face
Uh, nighttime, I'm up at the right time, uh, uh
Sewer damage, I say he get piped now
Demon baby, killin' shit on sight now
Money crazy, stay with least a hunnid thousand
Loaded, nigga know I'm in his bitch just like I'm Ben Fields (yeah)
Straight out them trenches but I still be with that shit still
I'm out the roof, I'm steady bootin'
I'm off of three pills
Like, bitch, you sleep, get left deceased, you know it's been real
Gladiator, catch him slippin', zip a hater
Cameras out there, I won't fade 'em
Burners out now, top say face 'em
Rich forever, no Schwarzenegger
Diamond face, that's a Terminator
Diamond face like I work a pager
Diamonds worth are forever greater
Big B, this is murder business
See 'em watchin', I can't cut the cable
Knock on the table, and excuse myself
Bitch nigga, you don't need no face
Strapped down, and he doped up
Through the date on the way I'm gon' make it
Lookin' down on these pussy niggas
Jocin' all of these hoes that's hatin'
Uh, nighttime, I'm up at the right time, uh, uh
Sewer diamonds, I say he get piped now
Demon baby, killin' shit on sight now
Money crazy, stay with least a hunnid thousand
Loaded, nigga know I'm in his bitch just like I'm Ben Fields (yeah)
Straight out them trenches but I still be with that shit still
I'm out the roof, I'm steady bootin'
I'm off of three pills
Like, bitch, you sleep, get left deceased, you know it's been real
