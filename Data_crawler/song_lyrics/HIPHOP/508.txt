Song Name: Who Shot Cupid?
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Bitches on me, that's often
Doin' them really bizarre things
Purps on the beat
She know me well, well, well
She know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still
Bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken
You need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure
One thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure
One thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We ain't gon' do this, not again
Gucci cardigan, I'm the flyest gent
I found out what the problem is
Breakin' promises
It was the both of us
Are all girls the same, same, same?
Two blue pills to the brain, brain, brain
Yeah, I kinda miss your brain
And I bet you miss my face
She know me well, well, well
She know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still
Bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken
You need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure
One thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hope that I'll never die again
Bullets fly again, Cupid hit his target
Guess he's been target practicing
Devil's panickin', it makes it worse for my heart
All girls aren't the same, same, same
But it's still two pills to the brain, brain, brain
I hope you never change, change, change
I also hope we put the drugs away
Well, well, well, well
She do me well
I hope she loves me for real
'Cause I been through hell
All the drugs I did
They weren't worth it, now I'm worthless
I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect
Sometimes I feel like that she'll be better off
Without me but without her I would die, oh
I would die, oh
She know me well, well, well
She know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure
One thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
