Song Name: Trap (feat. Lil Baby)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heya
(Fallen)
Only love a real nigga
Ever knew was trap
I trap, I trap
Really came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever
Knew was trap
That's fact, that's fact
Really came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
Trap, she do licks
She the one I forget
She do coke, she do blow
She do dope, make a list
This the life, don't forget
Sober nights, make it lit
She the one, you the one
I'm the one, what a trick
I ain't never tellin' lies
Cross my heart and hope to die
If it's real, it's real forever
May we never testify
Put the pedal to the floor
Look the devil in the eyes
If you tell me that you love me
Promise not to change your mind
We like sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the lights?
Wish you furs for the winter
Wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police
Only love a real nigga
Ever knew was trap
I trap, I trap
Really came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga
Ever knew was trap
That's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
Trap, only thing we ever
Had to do was trap
I was breaking down
Bales and now switched
It with rap
Shawty was the man
Like damn nigga, what happened?
I'ma keep throwing the money
As far as I ever see
Had to keep my double-cup
Feel like it was killin' me
I was sittin' in the spot
Ain't never missed a beat
If I'm feelin' in my heart
I'ma put it on a beat, like
Runnin' down home, don't trip
Make sure your whole clip fit
Know it was hard even
Tryna survive this bullshit
I'm a part of my niggas
We all gon' get rich
Still remember sellin' 2-for-5
Now I have a million dollar ride
Still be havin' thoughts about the guy
(Only love a real nigga ever knew I)
We like sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the lights?
Wish you furs for the winter
Wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police
Only love a real nigga
Ever knew was trap
I trap, I trap
Really came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever
Knew was trap
That's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the map
No turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
