Hitmaka
I like girls who like girls (Ooh)
Kissing on her friend off white, girl (Off white)
And she 23 like Michael
I like girls who like girls (Yeah)
Yeah, I like (Yeah)

Yeah, I like (Ooh)

Shawty and her friend (Friend)
Bustin' for them bands (Bands)
Do it with no hands (Hands)
Got me in a trance (Trance)
Thirsty like Thursday (Thursday)
It must be her birthday (Hey)
She just made it earthquake
Shawty, she in first place (Hey)
Yeah, two bad hoes (Bad)
Brand new foreign, I'ma act an asshole (Yeah)
Do the dash, ho, just spilled lean on my Ksubi jeans
I'm swervin' lanes while she chewin' me
I swear you'd think it was two of me
Hop out the Lam', jump in the Wraith
I be so high, I'm outer space
Shawty a freak, she off a bean
She told me put that shit right on her beams
Yeah, I know what you like, girl
You ain't got no type, girl
Puerto Rican, black and Asian
Of course you like white girls
I like girls who like girls (Ooh)
Kissing on her friend off white, girl (Off white, white)
And she 23 like Michael (Like Mike)
I like girls who like girls (Like girls, yeah)
Yeah, I like (Yeah)
I like girls who like girls (I like girls, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I like (Ooh)
I like girls who like girls
Shawty, she a freak, she got everything I need
Her and all her friends going 'cause it's Skies and PnB
I would never tell our secret, let's just keep it in the sheets
Smoke a Backwood while you suck it, damn, you made it hard to breathe
Yeah, she legit (Yeah)
We walk inside the club and my girl leave with your bitch (Your bitch)
Her nails done, hair done, diamonds on her wrist (Her wrist)
We ballin' every day like what's a bench and an assist?
Got no type like Swae Lee (Lee)
My bitches all on fleek (Fleek)
Spread the love equally
I ain't switchin', pickin' teams (No)
Different locations with some foreigns overseas (Go)
And you know this shit ain't nothin' to a G 'cause
I like girls who like girls (Like girls)
Kissing on her friend off white, girl (Off white, yeah)
And she 23 like Michael (Like Mike)
I like girls who like girls (Like girls, yeah)
Yeah, I like (Yeah)
I like girls who like girls (I like girls, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I like (What?)
I like girls who like girls (Hey)
