Song Name: WokStar (feat. Strick & Skepta)
Aero
Grah, grah
(Ayy, run it back, Sluzyyy)
Skrrt
Jumped off the porch, then made a pit stop at the bank (let's go)
Like I'm playing golf, I could hit holes today (today)
Glass house loft, Atlantic Station, had it trapped out (trap, trap)
Water on my wrist like I died in the Atlantic (trap, wow)
YSL elite, all the slimes never panic (no way, slatt)
I'll die about my bands, close to the top, I had to manage that (for real)
Wockhardt rockstar (yeah)
Black excellence, stars in the car (skrrt)
I make Barry Bonds hits
I'm like Tony, I'm like Mitch
Match my voice to the tempo, I get paid in full (paid in full)
Paid cash records just like Chavo and Z-Bo (and Z-Bo)
Keep that mula like my brother Mula name (Mula name)
She already know that I'm lit (I'm lit)
I got the world in my wrist (okay)
Tires screechin', we got her geeked up, diablo shorty (diablo, skrrt)
I got a party pack in my pocket, let's get the party started (party started)
Yeah, I could, I'm the captain, she had to take it to the sargeant (sargeant)
Closet full with too many racks, put 'em in the floor (floor)
Superstar, lookin' for me, need a telescope (I'm gone)
I'm done with Alexander McQueen, I'm onto McCartney, bro
I had to make my name when I came 'round, that's what I did it for
Jumped off the porch, then made a pit stop at the bank (let's go)
Like I'm playing golf, I could hit holes today (okay)
Glass house loft, Atlantic Station, had it trapped out (trap, trap)
Water on my wrist like I died in the Atlantic (trap, wow)
YSL elite, all the slimes never panic (no way, slatt)
I'll die about my bands, close to the top, I had to manage that (for real)
Wockhardt rockstar (yeah)
Black excellence, stars in the car (skrrt)
Jumped off the jet, I left semen on the seat
I flew out to Greece, sippin' syrup by the sea (ice)
Banned me from the States, talkin' visa policies
They know we're them London niggas that these baddies wanna see (brrt)
I put that shit on, I'm a beast
I don't rock Amiri, this Givenchy unreleased
Every day, it's sauce spillin' when I'm steppin' in the streets (ice)
Even on a Sunday, boy, I'm fresher than a priest (greaze)
My brother checkin' for police 'cause he steppin' with it (smoke)
My strap could tell you I'm a freak, boy, I slept with it (smoke)
They used to curve me, now they say that I look photogenic (brrt)
I stopped complainin', I stopped waitin', had to go and get it
Jumped off the porch, then made a pit stop at the bank (let's go)
Like I'm playing golf, I could hit holes today (okay)
Glass house loft, Atlantic Station, had it trapped out (trap, trap)
Water on my wrist like I died in the Atlantic (trap, wow)
YSL elite, all the slimes never panic (no way, slatt)
I'll die about my bands, close to the top, I had to manage that (for real)
Wockhardt rockstar (yeah)
Black excellence, stars in the car (skrrt)
