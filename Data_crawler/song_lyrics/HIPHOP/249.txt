Song Name: Mr. Clean
Bum bum bum bum bum
Gravy
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream (bum bum bum bum)
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen (bum bum bum bum)
Give him two lips like roses and clover (bum bum bum bum)
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Gravy make it splash like Pippen
Shit that's nothin' (splash)
Everybody call me Big Pimpin'
No, I ain't bluffin'
I'm with your mom in the kitchen
Makin' blueberry muffins
Must be Thanksgiving
'Cause your bitch want the stuffin'
Mr. Clean
Gravy why your flow so mean?
Mr. Clean
Pull up with my whole damn team
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Gravy, he be clean like Windex (woo)
Just hit your mom with my index (woo)
And yo' bitch look like a pinhead
All my haters, they be skinheads
Pissed off 'cause they wife is they sister
And Yung Gravy just kissed her (hot damn)
Pull up on the scene
'Cause a wet dream, I might need a submarine
If you got the beef I turn yo' ass to smitherines (uh)
Yo' bitch lookin' scary I thought it was Halloween
Gravy, he be clean like some fucking Listerine (uh)
But I smooth it out like a jar of Vaseline
Shit
Posted with a MILF and her name is Charlene
Everybody wonder how she got the hygiene
It's all thanks to Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Gravy why your flow so mean?
Mr. Clean
Pull up with my whole damn team
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean
Gravy, he be clean like Colgate (aye)
White MILF Charlene that's my soulmate (aye)
You ain't got a bitch I might donate (aye)
Slide in the DMs with the snowflake (uh-uh)
Talkin 'bout your girl my favorite topic
You can't even see me, you would think I'm microscopic
Gravy ballin' out like the fuckin' Flint Tropics
Turn these bitches on 'cause I'm really good at Bop-It
Clean in, clean out (woo)
Pullin' up drop top Viper (aye)
Had to steal yo' bitch (uh)
Finessed it like I'm Swiper (aye)
So much bread, gotta get my fiber
Gravy, he be cleaner than your windshield wipers (uh)
Your step-mom made me a pie
You can call me the Pied-Piper (sheesh)
I don't eat the booty, I ain't even gotta say it
But I'll eat my girls ass if she had a bad day (aye)
Gravy don't play
Bitch I'm at the bakery, them donuts gettin glazed
Stay with three hoes like it's the holidays
Stuck to the bread, you would think I'm mayonnaise
(Hot damn)
Shit I'm so God damn clean, got me feelin' like I'm Billy Mays
(Holy shit)
Mr. Clean
Gravy why your flow so mean?
Mr. Clean
Pull up with my whole damn team
Mr. Clean
