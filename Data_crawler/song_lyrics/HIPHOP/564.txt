Song Name: Broke In A Minute
Yeah, ah, word to Mazi, nigga, ah
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Haha
When they swing that way to the right
You swing to the left, you heard?
Papiyerr
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your hoe in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck and my wrist and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's
Came back and counted some millions
I ain't go regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
Bitch, let me finish
I got that Chevy for four days
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, hitting up 250 on biddy
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddy
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hand look pretty
Hit another band on the 'Gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted
But then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, the shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my giffy
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn
