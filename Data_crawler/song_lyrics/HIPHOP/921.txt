Song Name: 2040
Yeah
They don't want no beef, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm like, yeah, I'ma fuck with 'em, though
FOREVEROLLING
Flexin' on that-
I'm doin' donuts in my neighborhood, it made me feel good
I swore I would never do that shit again, but still do it
I feel better with no IG but I'm too big of an influence
And live your life, don't try to make someone else have that shit, might ruin it
Yeah, I make money off all type of shit, I got stocks for me and my children
Had to put the wide body on the Lamb' truck, it look sexy, call it "Mrs. Urus"
Fucked up playin' around, now I'm serious
I got 200 bands in each ear
I was damn near the man before I started rappin'
These other niggas just cappin'
I can take the top off while the car goin'
Call it, "Gettin' nasty in traffic"
I done reached another bracket, eight figure taxes
I can't touch a bitch if she average
Any location, play, we gettin' at 'em
All this shit come and go, it don't matter
These boys sub to 'em, you ain't add 'em
We don't even social beef, we get active
Everybody killin' now 'til somethin' happen
I feel uncomfortable without a ratchet
I might shoot my shot at what you call it
I'm forever ballin', I might eat her pussy good and never call her
I been runnin' from her, I heard you a stalker
But we is not the same, lil' nigga
I been dragged through the mud, had a girl fuck the plug
I put numbers on the board, this is not for no awards
I get money, that's enough
If I get him, that's a plus
Handle business is a must
Get hurt feelings when you trust
Came from prison, didn't have nothin'
Ran it up a couple months
Bustdown Patek came from Thug
Boy, you know, that's real love
I ain't never changin' up, yeah
If I like you, you lucky
I'ma change your whole life like it's nothing
Girl, I know not to stall when you come in
I be busy, I'm not in my comments
I be playin' with that fire like I'm John Wick
Don't be walkin' up on me
I'll be ballin' 'til 2040, I promise, I'm not for the moment
I be killin' that shit when I get there and wake up
And kill it again in the morning
I be chillin', but trust me, I handle the business
When it's to get it, I zone in
I'm the same way if I'm with 50 niggas who be killin' or I'm by my lonely
I be laughin' a lot but I'm gettin' confused
In the blink of the eye, I click
Ain't ever gon' switch
Switch for what? I give you everything you want
Bitch, for what? (Let's get it)
I call bitch right out the blue when I'm off this Perc' like, "Get this nut" (bitch, get this nut)
If you play with my name, I'm gettin' you touched
200 a show, not feelin' enough (feelin' enough)
I like switches, they take 50s, a nigga like me hate fillin' 'em up (ch-chic, boom)
I don't talk much, nigga like me gon' get that cash
I'm gettin' you touched (gettin' you touched)
Molly, Percocet, mask on, no, it's off, don't give no fuck
I pay rent to lawyers, got the Lamb' truck cash
I can't rent no Goyard
Growers call growers for that weed, just to fill this order (gang)
I know bitches act like they know Baby, so they feel important (let's get it)
I know niggas pay niggas for safety, so they get extorted (pussy)
I got shooters, take off half the city, I just get them Jordans (boom, boom, boom)
Rather send off all these goofies 'round me, just not none of my shorties
My foot on the gas (skrrt), I'm on they ass turnt
My homie just died off a bad Perc'
I'm lucky, you lucky, just ask Smurk
Put an opp inside a wood first
You suck it good, you get a good purse
20 million, I was in the trenches, I just stand on business
I'm the voice, can't give out a bad verse
If I like you, you lucky
I'ma change your whole life like it's nothing
Girl, I know not to stall when you come in
I be busy, I'm not in my comments
I be playin' with that fire like I'm John Wick
Don't be walkin' up on me
I'll be ballin' 'til 2040, I promise, I'm not for the moment
I be killin' that shit when I get there and wake up
And kill it again in the morning
I be chillin', but trust me, I handle the business
When it's to get it, I zone in
I'm the same way if I'm with 50 niggas who be killin' or I'm by my lonely
I be laughin' a lot but I'm gettin' confused
In the blink of the eye, I click
Ain't ever gon' switch
