Song Name: Christmas In Harlem
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus (yeah, uh)
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's 40 below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm so happy I'm with my baby
And we a lil' late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is, "Where my presents?"
She said, "Shh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, "It's Dee-ricious" ha-ha-ha-ha
Christmas in Harlem (yeah)
Right after autumn falls (uh, uh)
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa though)
Even though we ain't ballin' (somebody sit on my lap)
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York, I'm still reppin' for the A
Christmas in Harlem (CyHi)
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in, in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hood
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus, yeah
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
