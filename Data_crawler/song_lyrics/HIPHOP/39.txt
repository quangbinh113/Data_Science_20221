Song Name: Carry On
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down
Trapped in the concept
Falsely accused misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my...
Uh, cold shoulder, heart broken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance
On my grave, inside my head
I see your face, I fucking hate
That I love you still
High up (yeah), you're falling back down
Carry on, like flights, i just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, i just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, i just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back
