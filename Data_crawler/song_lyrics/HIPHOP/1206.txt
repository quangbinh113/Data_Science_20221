Song Name: Hurt From Mercury
I've lost my love, I'm sad (so sad)
She's found someone who's better (who's better than me)

Takes you to every party, just to dance and dance again
I can click my feet, I can snap my hands
And you're still not back again
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (no, it didn't do it for you, babe)
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (ooh, nothin', yeah)
And this pain inside my heart will fade away (I know)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Damn, it hurt so bad)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (yeah, it makes me sad)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Ooh, woah)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Why does it hurt so bad?)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (yeah, it makes me sad)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh, no, no, no)
Why does it hurt so bad?

I sit in my room thinking I wanna be your lover
But I've been rejected so bad
Sat down at every party and watched you laugh and laugh again
While I click my feet and I snap my hand
'Cause you're still not back again (no)
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (no, it didn't do it for you, babe)
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (ooh, nothin', yeah)
And this pain inside my heart will fade away (I know)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Damn, it hurt so bad, ooh, yeah, I know)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (yeah, it makes me sad)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh, I need somethin' to stop this pain)
Why does it hurt so bad? (So bad, yeah)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh-woah, woah, ooh-woah)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (yeah, it makes me sad)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Ooh-woah, woah, oh, woah)
Why does it hurt so bad?
You the girl that I love, be my woman
Something 'bout that girl, I want her to be my lover
See something 'bout this girl, I want her to be my woman
She wanna dance nonstop, she's tired of it
