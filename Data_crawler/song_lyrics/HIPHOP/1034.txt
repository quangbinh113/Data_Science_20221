(Loesoe goin' crazy)
(Molly)
(Molly)
Yeah
That's lil' Becky (yeah) off that molly water
She get hectic, off that molly water
Not no Fetty, don't know how I'm earthbound, but I'm ready
So much water on me just like a levee
Molly heart, molly water, water (on that molly)
Molly heart, molly water, water (it's on my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (bitch, I'm out my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (drop some damn Jollies)
She say she won't pop a molly
I just took some damn ecstasy, I'm floating out my body
Man, these niggas don't exist to me, invisible like Parley
My lil' shawty, she a brat, I ain't fuckin' on no Barbie
Niggas want me on they time, but I'm showin' up tardy
I make millions by the day
I ain't doin no more parties (but I love it)
I'm in hella Rick, where the fuck is Morty? (Yeah)
Shawty trippin', tryna find a fuck to give
It's like tryna find Dorothy
That's lil' Becky (yeah) off that molly water (molly)
She get hectic, off that molly water
Not no Fetty, don't know how I'm earthbound, but I'm ready
So much water on me just like a levee
Molly heart, molly water, water (on that molly)
Molly heart, molly water, water (it's on my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (bitch, I'm out my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (drop some damn Jollies)
Yeah, she put her own molly in her water, nigga, I ain't Rick Ross
With my dick on her lips, smeared face like lip gloss
Nigga, I ain't MMG, but lil' nigga, I'm a big boss
Molly water on me, nigga, I don't sip VOSS (molly water)
Ballin' on these niggas like Chris Bosh (molly water)
Time is precious, Richard Mille for the wristwatch (molly water)
Kingdom Hearts pirate ship, they gon' get washed (molly water, ah)
Bitch, my life a movie every day, this ain't no Redbox
That's lil' Becky (yeah) off that molly water (molly)
She get hectic, off that molly water
Not no Fetty, don't know how I'm earthbound, but I'm ready
So much water on me just like a levee
Molly heart, molly water, water (on that molly)
Molly heart, molly water, water (it's on my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (bitch, I'm out my body)
Molly heart, molly water, water (drop some damn Jollies)
