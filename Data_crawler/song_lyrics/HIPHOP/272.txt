Song Name: T-Shirt (feat. Lil Wayne)
Ever
She know I need her, I couldn't leave her
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
In my t-shirt, in-in my t-shirt (Oh yeah)
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In-in my t shirt, in-in my t shirt
Woah, there she go (Woah)
When I wake up in the morning, see you spreading (on my sheets)
It's so many things that's going through my head (while you sleep)
If I touch you there, I bet you spread your legs (More freak)
Kill that pussy then I put you back to bed (R.I.P.)
But hold up, when we done, yes that was good sex
But go hop in the shower and make me some breakfast
I want some french toast, with all that extra cheese
Eggs, home fries and I'm good with the ketchup
And I want some turkey bacon too
I'm hungry so make a plate for two
Then I snack on your booty, go blend me a smoothie
I swear I can't leave it and that's word to Lil Tunechi
She know I need her (Yeah), I couldn't leave her (Woah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
In my t shirt (In my t shirt),
In-in my t shirt (Oh yeah, in my t shirt)
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t shirt
In-in my t-shirt, in-in my t-shirt
I hit you when times is hard (Yeah)
'Cause you help my mind evolve (Yeah)
You take my mind abroad (Yeah)
Must be a sign from God (Yeah)
I gots to keep you close (Close)
He likes to give you rope (Damn)
He let you hang yourself (Damn), I let you hang and smoke (Yeah)
I let you drank and smoke (Yeah)
We fuck, we talk, we joke
We get emotional, you cry, and I got a lump in my throat
Man, love is so dope
Girl fuck that fuckboy
And you don't need no fuck toys
And you can make as much noise
And if you're down for it, I'm up for it
But it's something about your fucking eyes
That can see through to my other side
And these other hoes (Yeah), they make me cum (Woah)
But you, you make me come alive
She know I need her (Woah), I couldn't leave her (Yeah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
In my t-shirt (In my t shirt), in-in my t-shirt (In my t-shirt)
I'm a believerr (Woah), this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In-in my t-shirt, in-in my t-shirt
She know I need her (Woah), I couldn't leave her (Yeah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she)
In my t-shirt (In my t-shirt), in-in my-t shirt (In my t shirt)
I'm a believer (Yeah), this girl a keeper (Woah)

T-shirt, my-t shirt
