Song Name: Gone
I need to know now, know now (Lewi White Beats)
Can you love me again?
Nah, you can't roam here
Roam here if you chill on the fence
So you better tell me, tell me (I need to know now, know now)
I could be gone in a year (can you love me again?)
Nah, you can't roam here
Roam here if you chill on the fence
So you better tell me, tell me (I need to know now, know now)
I could be gone in a year
Ay, If you guys wanna chill on the fence
Then you and you can both be gone
Heard darling want Saint Laurent
But I'm not sure if you're the one
She knows eight-man from separate sides
Trust me no octagon
Passed 'round town, but no baton
I'm cutting the vibe, man fuck the bond
But hold on, so let me catch my breath
Forget her, check my new thing next
Yeah, she cute and she from north-west
Other man, can't pose no threats
I'm only the one she gets
She can see that I try my best
She ring my phone, I can't do text
I'm studio trappin', you know the rest
Nah, you can't roam here
Roam here if you chill on the fence
So you better tell me, tell me (I need to know now, know now)
I could be gone in a year (can you-?)
Disagreements here and there
Cah you made your point after like a decimal
That means that we argue a lot
It's just our thing, it ain't unethical
Otherwise, yeah, you match my style
We're goofing around, so I guess we're symmetrical
I assume that you're fine with the vibe
Cah you say all the time, this feelings electrical
Don't go, so much that love I cannot show
We'll grow, but slow
Take our time and go with the flow
Oh, no, these roads
Friends turn fake and the truth unfolds
I swear that the truths unfold
Why'd you think that I'm usually so alone
Nah, you can't roam here
Roam here if you chill on the fence
So you better tell me, tell me (I need to know now, know now)
I could be gone in a year
Nah, you can't roam here, roam-roam (I need to know now, know-know, know now)
Roam here if you chill on the fence (can you love me again)
So you better tell me, tell me (I need to know now, know now)
I could be gone in a year (can you love me again?)
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
