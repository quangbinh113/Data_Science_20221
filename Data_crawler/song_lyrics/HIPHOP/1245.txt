Song Name: Neva Cared
Before I put it in, I smack her ass
Pull out my iFeezy, hit record, turn on the flash
We gon' make a movie like Ray J and Kim Kardash'
Put her on the block list that's if that pussy trash
I'm Polo G, stressing who? It ain't a bitch that I can't smash
Probably fucked her too, it ain't a bitch that I ain't had
Man this shit is nothing, you the type to hit and brag
Run yo' mouth too much, I'm starting to think you niggas fags
Hard for me to slow down, I got used to living fast
Bitch I love the gang, on granny I'a give them boys my last
Only be with shooters, you can't hang if you don't blast
Please don't try me like DeJ Loaf, I put them killers on yo' ass
Always shouting out my block 'cause bitch that's where I started
Ahead of my class, yeah I always been the smartest
Ain't no competition even though they try they hardest
I know they be hating but I'm in my bag regardless
Give this shit a year or two, let's see who get the farthest
Don't play in these streets before you turn into a target
You could think you crazy but my shorties get retarted
If I call up CCB, they scoring like they can't be guarded, bitch
That AR be shooting
I call it G-Unit 'cause you know that bitch stay with 50
Had trigga' just tap it, don't pull it
Ain't saving no bullets, I shoot 'til it's empty
Like a yoga trainer we be stretching shit
We come through with the texts and the messages
Ain't no talk it out
Police chalk him out, only way we can think we can settle shit
Had to cancel my old bitch, she was choosing
I ain't tripping, I don't miss her 'cause a thot gon' be a thot (haha)
Niggas from the other side dissing my homies
I ain't tripping, just gon' kill him 'cause a opp gon' be a opp (bitch)
Fuck that Wawa shit, we don't social beef, we grab Glocks
Spot news, make reports when we speeding past blocks
Bitch it's nighttime, so we bringing out them red dots
Got a long nose nine and this bitch don't blow out snot
Feel like Jordan vs. Utah, I'm deadly with that last shot
Back to poking niggas, if I lose everything that I got
You keep flicking up with them rolls
Then we might have to enter yo' slot
Put that barrel on yo' head, take yo' new chain and yo' watch (pussy)
I been T'd since I got that news my homie dead
Caught yo' homie lacking (bop! Knocked off his dread!)
Just a satisfaction we'a come take off a nigga head
Hollows like a deadly virus, bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh, make a mess, get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy, nobody getting spared
Man, you niggas bitches, why the fuck would I be scared
30 shots up in my bomb, my momma told me be prepared
Heard the streets been talking, I know what they said
Capalot been gridin', shorty gon' get to that bread
Ballin' like I'm Bryant, naw not Kobe bitch lil' ass
See, you could stay on the sideline, I'ma run it up instead aye, uh
I'ma run it up instead
See you could stay on the sideline, I'ma run it up instead, bitch
Lil Capalot in this bitch man
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on man
Long live twin, I'm 1300-21 gang man
Talkin' some gang shit man
You already know what the fuck I'm rockin' with
