Song Name: Queen And Slim
Slimmy, Queen to my Slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dyin' for your love
Will you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely
Girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy
I get jaded feelin' lonely, come and hold me
I need someone that really know me, and girl, you know me
Lay you down and let me stroke you slowly
But you told me sit it back inside that car while I was drivin'
And you did it lowkey, ayy
Slimmy, Queen to my Slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dyin' for your love
Will you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely
Girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy, ayy
I fumble, try to rumble
Takin' shots to make her stumble
1942 all on the deck soon as you come through
One-two, one-two
If it's ever goin' down, you know who you can run too, yeah
My thugga, co-co butter
That's my crime, that's my mob, that's my knuck-or-bucker
We get faded walkin' through the house or stutter-stutter
Fall inside your sheets and fall inside your undercover, uh
Slimmy, Queen to my Slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dyin' for your love
Will you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely
Girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy
Look
We ain't talked in a long minute
Shit we used to do was authentic
Why we had to put our hearts in it?
Love came, put some scars in it
Feelings change, put some darts in it
Heart is changin', left me sharp-winded
Left the bike and left the bar spinnin'
Everybody play they parts in it
Justin dropped you straight into the crib
He been lowkey hatin' on the kid
You and Munchie drunk inside a ally
Been anticipatin' from the telly
Walked in the penthouse ready
Walked in the penthouse wavy
Finna put his dick off in her belly
Ride me like a motherfuckin' lady
House call to Jordyn Woods' house
Knocked out and woke up on the couch
Woke back and drove to your crib
This time I just know what it is
Next time, the pool with you and Kylie
Hopped in it, coolin', nigga wilin'
She was lookin' like a fuckin' angel
Lookin' like a baby in a manger
Hop step, went to the car
(Motherfucker, but, bitch, you got me fucked up)
Me and Kylie still off in the pool
We just chillin', kickin' shit, was cool
Both of us ain't know you was trippin'
Even though I got a crush on Kylie
I woulda left with you if I knew you was dippin' for the simple reason
You invited me but I can't act like shawty didn't excite me
I had took a wrong turn that night
Well not a turn that everybody think
I wasn't the wrong one that night
You was just too drunk to even see it
Wasn't anticipatin', I'd never put you in no situation
I've never even had an argument with ya
A conversation is all I'm bargainin' with ya
'Cause you was my nigga for real
And if you can agree, then you owe me that
Our mothers would tell us to do the right thing
And it's friendship, my nigga, you told me that
So even when niggas is comin' at me
On they Twitter and Insta, I'm over that
'Cause what's a couple months of memes of me
If it means, I'm gon' get my homie back?
Fuck it, let's talk about it
Do you think anybody else inside of the business
That know they ain't did it would sit here and listen to critics
While niggas is trippin' and bashin' me?
Out here attackin' me, actually
Only reason why I let 'em do it
Is 'cause I figured that you would've called a nigga
But look it's been over two months and all you did was stall, my nigga
The drama is bigger than ever
I thought that we both were bigger than that
Yeah, and the shit that I did, it was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that
Just listen to Jigga on that one track song
Cryin' while it play in the back
I never cared to be that nigga in your fame
Shawty, I was playin' it back
We never had a thing when we met each other
It was never a thing like that
Spendin' this time's what made us attached
Spendin' my time's what made you react
I'm only human
I gotta be real and tell you, that the pain done came with that
Even the feelin' is strange at that
How you gon' up and just change the facts?
Hard to find your love (find your love, baby)
When you walked away (when you walked, ayy)
When I sleep, the thoughts of you don't stay away, no
Lost to love, what's up, babe? (Lost in love was somethin', baby)
I was finally free (free)
The thoughts of you made it stay away, no
