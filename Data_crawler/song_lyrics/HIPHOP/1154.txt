Song Name: Rainfall (feat. Tiana Major9)
Ah, embody it, yeah
Let your man speak
I never put no colors on my timepiece
I told you niggas cut me out the grime beef
And now you got me fuckin' up some Grime neeks
So 'low runnin' up your gums
Man'll double back and then I'll go and double up my funds
And when you're finished suckin' on your mums
I do another quarter mil, and get another number one, it's like
I'm gettin' bored of you boys
Flex on 'em, lookin' like the Audemars boys
Big Mike, I was makin' all of the noise
In a big fur jacket, that's the thoughts of your boy
They rate me, that's so blatant
When I saw the future, that's so Raven
Whenever they say my name, I take a payment
Even when I make it rain I make a statement
Let the rain fall on my enemies
Fall on my enemies
Let the rain fall on my enemies
All of my enemies
Yeah, let the rain fall on my enemies
On all of my enemies
Lord, let the rain fall on my enemies
Let it fall on my enemies
Yo, goose in the winter keep my back warm
Told my little brudda keep my stack warm
Kill me with some rap corn
I'm a bigger hitter on a bigger platform
Now we do the Jigga walk
Reminiscin' 'bout the spinners that my hitta brought
(So) So 'low me with that Twitter talk
I can't even hear you through these Brit awards (Ayy, ayy)
I put my shades on
Hoodie up and send a prayer up to Trayvon
They tryna figure how a nigga put his name on
And how a nigga did it with no chains on
I give you the keys to no stress
First you give God the praise then see him work
I can't ever be on my knees, I'm too blessed
'Cause any time I make it rain I'm reimbursed, then I-
Let the rain fall on my enemies
Fall on my enemies
Let the rain fall on my enemies
All of my enemies
Yeah, let the rain fall on my enemies
On all of my enemies
Lord, let the rain fall on my enemies
Let it fall on my enemies
Yo
Fall on my enemies
Fall on my enemies
Let the rain fall on my enemies
Fall on my enemies
Yeah, let the rain fall on my enemies
On all of my enemies
Lord, let the rain fall on my enemies
Let it fall on my enemies
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (I can dance)
I just wanna praise yah (Ooh), I just wanna praise yah (Praise you ooh)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my head (I can lift my head)
And I'm gonna praise yah (Praise you), I'm gonna praise yah (Oh, praise yah)
Take the shackles off my face so I can dance (So I can dance, I can dance)
I just wanna praise yah, I just wanna praise yah (Yeah)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my head (I can lift my head)
And I'm gonna praise yah (I'm gonna praise yah)
I'm gonna praise you (I'm gonna praise yah)
Fall on my enemies (Ooh)
Fall on my enemies
Let the rain fall on my enemies (Ooh)
All of my enemies (Ooh)
Yeah, let the rain fall on my enemies (All of my enemies)
On all of my enemies
Lord, let the rain fall on my enemies
Let it fall on my enemies
