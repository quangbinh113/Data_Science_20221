Song Name: 90mh
Ayy, yeah, ayy
Ayy
You don't really want smoke, you ain't 'bout that shit
I been cruisin' down the block with a bad ass bitch
With my mind on the chips and this nine on my hip
Fucked then I dip, say I'm finna' take a trip
You don't really want smoke, you ain't 'bout that shit
I been cruisin' down the block with a bad ass bitch
With my mind on the chips and this nine on my hip
Fucked then I dip, say I'm finna' take a trip
Nigga too icy, I pull up in layers
Don't need a plate, I'm still gonna' slay her
Mind on the bread but I'm not a baker
Need to teach school with the way that I get paper
I don't fuck with 12, don't fuck with no rules
I do fuck with guns, so hand me that Ruger
Pass me the gas, I'm finna' get higher
Don't need a test, I know she a liar
Niggas dumb as hell, they don't got no bread, but won't bail
They don't fuck with nobody, but won't mail
Don't send me your tape, it won't sell
Yo, I'm sorry ho, that I couldn't be your Romeo
'Cause you was too focused on Julio
And now I'm too focused on getting dough, bitch
You don't really want smoke, you ain't 'bout that shit
I been cruisin' down the block with a bad ass bitch
With my mind on the chips and this nine on my hip
Fucked then I dip, say I'm finna' take a trip
You don't really want smoke, you ain't 'bout that shit
I been cruisin' down the block with a bad ass bitch
With my mind on the chips and this nine on my hip
Fucked then I dip, say I'm finna' take a trip
Water my diamonds, my body shinin'
She follow like Simon, get hit like a Lion
Call up the plug 'cause I'm rollin' a bud
You're not from the hood, get that understood
I tote the MAC, get hit in the back
'Cause we carry tacks and all of this shit rack
I'm in the booth and I'm smokin' on cookie
I know that I'm fresh but I'm still not a rookie, bitch
Ayy
On my mama
On my mama, nigga
On my mama, this heat (For real, nigga)
Ayy, FUEGO
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, FUEGO
