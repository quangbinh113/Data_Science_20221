Song Name: Do The Most
Foot on necks
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I say word to my ex, I might never fall in love again (What?)
Chase nothin' but the liquor in the cup again (Uh)
I did a show, I'm leavin' with a hunnid bands
And I ain't stut-, stut-, stu-stutter, man
Yeah, I got two birds (Brrr), like Stunna, man
Hotline Bling (Brrr), that's a hunnid bands
In the night club, they be like, "You done it, man" (Oh yeah)
In the night, chain lookin' like "Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh"
Got the house party all tilted (It's lit)
I fuck that girl, she fucked my girl, I feel guilty
Gotta feel me (Oh yeah), I'm filthy (Oh yeah)
I call a lot of women bae but you my real bae
She got that ice cream, she supersize it, nigga (Supersize)
Swimmin' in it feelin' like a scuba-diver, nigga (Scuba dive)
Say you got my point, this besides it, nigga
You can't even sit that ass beside a nigga
Woah (Go)
I'm in your city on some hot shit
I fuck, her, her, her, I'm on some thot shit
My outfit is brazy, this shit a mosh pit
And all you hatin' ass niggas, get off my dick
Ayy, I do my own stunts
And I ain't passin' shit, I smoke my own blunts
If ain't lil' mami ain't into me, then you on some (On some)
Stack up then throw somethin'
Girl, let me poke somethin' (Pour somethin')
Lil' Tory, ayy
Everybody lit, take a toast (Take a toast)
I feel alive when I'm goin' ghost (Goin' ghost)
I gotta keep my niggas real close (Real close)
'Cause if I don't, they gon' do the most (Oh yeah)
Everybody lit, take a toast (Take a toast)
I feel alive when I'm goin' ghost (Goin' ghost)
I gotta keep my niggas real close (Real close)
'Cause if I don't, they gon' do the most (Oh yeah)
Play me wrong, shit I might fuck it up (Shit I might fuck it)
You lookin' good in them jeans
Shit I might touch and nut (I might touch and nut)
Shit like, this one chick back in the day, she tried to put me out
I put on her knees and I put it in her mouth
I got a fresh outfit and I must say
When I step in the bitch, don't touch me (Touch me)
When I'm starin' in the mirror, don't be rushin' my shit (Don't be rushin')
See my hairline fresh, don't be touchin' my shit (Ha, ha)
'Cause I'ma get my ex bitch back (Back)
Have her on some, how you got it like that? (Like that)
From the air, girl, you see me at the ware'
I'm a boss, throwin' salt, kill a snail, not a player (I'm not a player)
One Umbrella on my underwear (My underwear)
Somebody call for the sauce, I appear (I'm here)
In the club, shawty standin' right there
Like Chingy, I hit right there, right there, right there, ayy
Everybody lit, take a toast (Take a toast)
I feel alive when I'm goin' ghost (Goin' ghost)
I gotta keep my niggas real close (Real close)
'Cause if I don't, they gon' do the most (Oh yeah)
Everybody lit, take a toast (Take a toast)
I feel alive when I'm goin' ghost (Goin' ghost)
I gotta keep my niggas real close (Real close)
'Cause if I don't, they gon' do the most
