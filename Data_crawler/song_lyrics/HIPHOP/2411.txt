Song Name: Dancing In The Rain
Yeah
Oh, no doubt, he got it to perfection (Dwilly make it weird, go)
Uh
Dancing in the rain, I cannot refrain
From sliding in your dame, I get change
Dancing in the rain, can't fuck with these lames
I cannot complain, I get change
50K for a show, and a hunnid for my wrist
Hundred fifty for my skrrt
Couple milli' at the crib
Ain't your baby, baby
You can keep the gravy out your lips
Ain't no way that baby Gravy gonna change the way he live
50K for a show, and a hunnid for my wrist
Hundred fifty for my skrrt
Couple milli' at the crib
Ain't your baby, baby
You can keep it gravy out your lips
Ain't no way that baby Gravy gonna change the way he live (woo)
Bro these hoes? (No)
Dope? (No)
Hoe? (No)
No, no, Gravy still for Pope though
Bro these hoes? (No)
Dope? (No)
Hoes? (No)
No, no, Gravy still for Pope though
Bitch, I'm dead fresh, I might pull up in the hearse truck
Gravy been a dog, Lisa Ann was my first love
I stay with the bad hoes, but I be the worst one
When they pickin' teams, Gravy always be the first one
Juice, sauce, little bit of guala
Oops, just, super soaked your momma (soaked)
New bitch (woah), Michelle Obama
Gravy bring the ruckus to the local Benihana
50K for a show, and a hunnid for my wrist
Hundred fifty for my skrrt
Couple milli' at the crib
Ain't your baby, baby
You can keep the gravy out your lips
Ain't no way that baby Gravy gonna change the way he live
50K for a show, and a hunnid for my wrist
Hundred fifty for my skrrt
Couple milli' at the crib
Ain't your baby, baby
You can keep the gravy out your lips
Ain't no way that baby Gravy gonna change the way he live
(50K for a show)
For a motherfuckin' show
(And a hunnid for my wirst)
For my goddamn wrist
(Couple milli' at the crib)
At the motherfuckin' crib
Ain't no way that baby Gravy gonna change the way he live
