Song Name: Aston Martin Truck
Aston Martin truck, ride the tail off
Scratchin'
Aston Martin truck, ride the tail off
Skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt
Aston Martin truck, ride the tail off (vroom!)
Had to get a new butler, four new maids to clean my house (clean my house)
Give my momma, my daddy, and day-one niggas a key to my house (key to my house)
Made 500 thousand every time you see me out (see me out, yeah, yeah)
Out in public, with the grip (grip)
All the fans wanna take a pic'
Niggas not on my level, why you mad, I fucked your bitch? (Yeah)
Had to say it 'cause you talkin'
I ain't even tryna rub it in (rub it in)
I'm tryna make another hundrеd million
Figure out how I'm gon' bring my brothers in (yeah)
Madе Marni poppin', we put Marni on our jeans (yeah, yeah)
Niggas on my dick, niggas watchin' my show, tryna see my scene (yeah, yeah)
I been dickin' your bitch, I been dickin' your bitch
I'm the heartbreak king (I'm the heartbreak king)
And you went back and bought another diamond ring (ooh)
I'm about my money, I'm about my cake
I'm about my cream (I'm about my cream)
I keep tellin' you niggas, I'm in love with lean (in love with lean)
Cross on my wrist, ayy, Elliot got me right, stop
I hate my Cullinan, can't fit in a tight spot
Aston Martin truck, ride the tail off (vroom!)
Had to get a new butler, four new maids to clean my house (clean my house)

Stick to the street code, can't never tell shit (no, no)
I had a ten seats (yeah), ridin' in a Bentley coupe, okay
She was in the Bel-Air crib, okay
Hit it in the bed again, okay
She was like, "Sing for me," okay
She seen a hit low key, okay
You wanna vent O.T., okay
You wanna be a real rich bitch, okay
She say she wan' live in L.A. (L.A.)
So, I had to show her the city (the city)
She know I'm for really, she know I ain't kiddy
She know I be hangin' with killers (uh-huh)
Had her hangin' with me
Throwin' up Cs, lookin' like one of the members (woo, woo)
I never did pay for the pussy
'Cause that was not on my agenda (no, no)

I really like it now
(Yeah, yeah)
You, bitch, you
