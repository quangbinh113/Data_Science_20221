Song Name: Hopeless Romantic (feat. Swae Lee)
Young Chop on the beat
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
She's gonna get, ooh, ooh
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off that drink it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows?
I might just do you like me love it, yeah
Or make you my numero uno
She don't allow herself
To miss nobody else
I've had days where I was dolo (Where I was dolo)
But I never caught a bad case of FOMO (Don't miss out)
Don't talk to me about your previous
You know I'm that times two
Penthouse jumpin' from the front to back room
Girls goin' wild, showin' off new tattoos
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off the drink it's hard to focus
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows?
I might just do you like me love it, yeah
Or make you my numero uno
We get aggressive (We get aggressive)
You be undressin' (You be undressin')
Making a mess and (Making a mess and)
Cleanin' it up when we done
I got a serious question (Serious question)
Do you like sex? If you thinkin' yes
Then I'm tryna test you (I'm tryna test you)
Say young Khalifa, the best
But I got money to get (I got money to get)
I gotta hop on a jet (I gotta hop on a jet)
Probably don't call, I'ma text (Probably don't call, I'ma text)
Hop in my car, it get wet (Hop in my car, it get wet)
I'm getting all of my checks (I'm getting all of my checks)
I'm winning all of my bets (I'm winning all of my bets)
No, I ain't lettin' you down
Baby, I'm giving a hundred percent
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off the drink it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows?
I might just do you like me love it, yeah
Or make you my numero uno
I can't keep my mind off you
I can't keep my mind off you
I can't keep my mind off you
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off the drink it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows?
I might just do you like me love it, yeah
Or make you my numero uno
