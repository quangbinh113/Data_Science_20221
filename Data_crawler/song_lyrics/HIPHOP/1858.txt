Song Name: Bring Em Out
(Bring 'em out, It's hard to yell when the barrel's in ya mouth) Swizzie!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Ayy!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) T.I.
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Ayy!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State wanna see my need
The whole city got berserk, he got treat
Another nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin', money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin' shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt Town
I got the crowd yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hotgirls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Yeah, what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rappin' 'bout blow, I was movin' the shit
You talkin' 'bout shootin out, and I was doin' the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon' be suin' and shit
And if I catch another case, I know I'll truly be missed
So I'ma keep it cool, head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows, other rappers is bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine
I got a packed house yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hotgirls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Mic check 1-2, 1-2, you wanna beef with the king, what is you gon' do
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew
Or you and your friend'll play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'll be hittin the deck
I got a tool and a vest, I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Sho' 'em, this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nuts too large and we way too fresh
Work well with Nines, AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef? Nigga, bring ya best 'cause we'll be standin'-
In ya front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
In ya front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Hands in the air, now!
Hands in the air, now!
Hands-hands in-the-in-the air-air now!
Hands in the air, now!
Hands in the air, now!
Hands in the air, now!
Hands-hands in-the-in-the air-air now!
Hands in the air, now!
I can't hear you
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
I can't hear you
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
I can't hear you
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
I can't hear you
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
You just the heard the sound of the king of the South, T.I.
I go by the name of Swizz Beat the monster
I need y'all to rewind this and play this from the top
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
That shit was crazy
