Nigga got left at his own party 'cause
He sent the address to the wrong coast
Three-fifty-seven, long nose
Hit his top, bustin' cans like Stone Cold
Shawty bangin', he young with an old soul
Chains swangin', baguette with the rose gold
I might switch up the drip in VLONE clothes
Cap-a-lot got the game in the strong hold
If you pop forty, buckin' like DMX
The red tips and hollows gon' eat his flesh
And them 7.62s gon' leave him straight
Gotta eat with my goons, we need a check
My lil' cougar bitch call when she need sex
She gon' blow up my phone, I ain't see her text
Backshots when I'm strokin', I leave her wet
Next mornin' back on it, no need to rest
Grip it (grip it), grip it (grip it)
Click it (click it), click it, grrt, uh, baow
Hit it (hit it), run his block, spin it (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Uh, I be gettin' different women (I do)
Uh, good moves (good moves)
T. Dot (T. Dot), get it (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Grip it, grip it
Click it (click it), click it, grrt, uh, baow
Hit it (hit it), run his block, spin it (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Uh, I be gettin' different women (I do)
Uh, good moves (good moves)
T. Dot (T. Dot), get it (ayy, ayy, ayy)
