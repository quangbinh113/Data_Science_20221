Song Name: Worst Luck
You tell me get away
But you don't mean that
You tell me leave you alone
But you don't need that
On my own too
"Honey I don't need you
Look at how I've grown
Im a big girl
I can do it by myself
All on my own"
So why you wanna love me so bad
Why you wanna love me so bad
Haven't you heard about my miserable past
Critical past
Pitiful past
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
No no
I tell you let it go but you don't want to
I ask you what the fuck you want
You say I want you
Are you crazy
You could have it all
Why settle for me
You're doing good
You should keep going
Don't back pedal for me
So why you wanna love me so bad
Why you wanna love me so bad
Haven't you heard about my miserable past
Critical past
Pitiful past
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
But maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
But maybe I ain't working enough
Ain't hurting enough
No no
