Song Name: Similar
(Yung Lan on the track)

If you like to get money, we similar
If you keepin' a rod, we similar
If you servin' that pack, we similar
If you ever took losses, we similar
Gotta stick to the code and the literature
If you ever had nothin', we similar
On my street, ain't no love for no visitors
If you ever been jammed, know we similar
Send that bag down the road to the prisoners
Call my partner my twin 'cause we similar
Up that fire if you don't look familiar
Only fuckin' with la familia
We came from the bottom together, we struggled together, wе trappin' together
Only BC, we lockеd in forever, was rockin' together, was robbin' together
If it's problems, I got you, don't worry, I'ma pull out button for sure
They gon' be duckin' for sure
I might hit four in a row
I can't turn on my brother for nothin', not money or fame
It ain't no question, they feelin' the same
Ran that shit up from the dope game
I got partners who stuck in the chain gang
Matchin' 'Hawks when we ridin' on the highway
And my wrist cost the same as an i8
In the hood, I'm heavy like freeways
Caught a baddie from Spain, had to upgrade
On my street, it get wicked, treachery
Went to school on the block, we intelligent
We ain't lettin' these bitches divide us
The prosecutor wanna hide us
No matter what, we gon' triumph
If you came from the bottom, I fuck with you
Came from Section 8 houses, I fuck with you
Had to go sell that pack, then I fuck with you
If you like to get money, we similar
If you keepin' a rod, we similar
If you servin' that pack, we similar
If you ever took losses, we similar
Gotta stick to the code and the literature
If you ever had nothin', we similar
On my street, ain't no love for no visitors
If you ever been jammed, know we similar
Send that bag down the road to the prisoners
Call my partner my twin 'cause we similar
Up that fire if you don't look familiar
Only fuckin' with la familia
