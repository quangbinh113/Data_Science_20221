Song Name: Geeked Up (feat. Gucci Mane)
(OPM made it hit)
(Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like)
(My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks)
(We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes)
(Trackhawk, they cannot keep up)
(We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes)
(Trackhawk, they cannot keep up)
Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
XD wit' a stick, attached to the beam, so I know I won't miss
Let him run, he get left like he Rick, bullets burn him, watch him twitch
Fuck a cab, he got left in a Lyft, how y'all all linkin' up for a hit?
And thе Dub's to the T's to my dick, I'm tryna spin through, and hangout the whip
I'm tryna hit a goofy in his shit, one got hit in his back and hе tripped
And the other one almost went out like a bitch
I was prayin' to God, make him slip
I'm tryna slide in the Stoley
Let him run, I'ma get wit' his brodie
Don't need to show, I could do this shit doley
Fuck if I'm rich, I'ma still take his Rolly
R.I.P. Naz', yeah, I'll blaze for the crodie
He get got, he could keep what he owe me
He get shot, give a fuck what he told me
Shoot like I'm Curry, I know they can't hold me
Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up (it's Gucci)
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up (go)
N.Y.C. to the A, niggas get shot everyday (baow, baow)
They find out where you stay, and they gon' come where you lay (come to the crib)
Me and my gang don't play, got soldiers, on watch with the 'K (on watch with the-)
You pussy, better watch what you say, and this better stay out the way (stay out my face)
I put a opp in his place, like both got shot in the face (got shot in the what?)
Thought he was runnin' the race, but now he just runnin' in place (can't even run)
I got bodies, like a drill rapper, I ain't cappin', I'ma real rapper
Even before I had a deal, ask 'em, Gucci labelled as a real trapper ('Wop)
Gucci and Kay Flock, leave a nigga cold
But the Glock on my hip, yeah, it stay hot (brr)
Try to pull the Wraith out, but he got the Wraith shot
And 12 on my block tryna stakeout (damn)
Let my nigga shake out, got him on max
And I know he gettin' mad, wanna break out (damn)
Walkin' with a shake out, blow up your tank-top
Stay out the top, knock your brains out (ugh)
Money, I don't think out, but a nigga dream 'bout
Went from a jail to a dream house
Started from the trap, I was ichin' out to scrap
I was so many pieces, it's a green house
AKA the codeine house
Hunnid' pints in, so we called it the Lean House (Lean)
Gucci Mane, yeah, I'm the king now
Used to be the plug, but now he just a fiend now (Gucci)
Like, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
We shoot at your gang, switchin' through lanes
Trackhawk, they cannot keep up
