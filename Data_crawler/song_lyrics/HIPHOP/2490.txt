Song Name: Hungry Hippo
He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thank you, I designed it"
Not your average girl
He needed swag and I provide it ('vide it)
Open up and bite it, bite it
Open up and bite it, bite it
Open up and bite it, bite it
Shut up boy, bite it
He don't know no better, yeah
Heard he got that cheddar, yeah
Now that boy with me
He gon' spend it better, yeah
Put him on that Alyx
Gucci on his wallet
Rick Owens on me
They think that I'm his stylist
Bite it
He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thank you, I designed it"
Not your average girl
