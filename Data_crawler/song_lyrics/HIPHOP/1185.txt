Song Name: Rockstar In His Prime
I'm a rockstar in his prime
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
That don't make no sense, do it? Haha
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup, then I won't fly
I'm a rockstar in his prime
A rockstar in his prime
A rockstar in his prime
A rockstar in his prime
A rockstar in his prime
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup, then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup, then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt
Everything is just fine
Minus the fact that I'm losing my mind
Timeless in fact, I know it's my time
Prime time, limelights
Tears on the Saint Laurent
Feel like punching a wall, but I don't wanna break the watch
It was just a year ago, I was telling people, "Watch!"
Thank you, God, it was a part of the plot
It feel like part of me alive and part of me not
I'm tracing my steps, tryna see where the insanity started
I'm too high to talk right now, I'm sorry, beg my pardon
This not a trend
It's how I'ma deal with my demons regardless
Oh yeah, Devil pulling up a chair, he sitting right over there
Telling me I should be scared, God in my fucking ear
Told me it's nothing to fear
I forgot to mention that the Devil tryna be my friend
Do you hear how confusing this is?
I was at the lowest of points, feeling like calling it quits
Ain't nobody understand, "You should be happy, nigga, you rich"
That's what everybody says, anxiety is a ugly bitch
Too ugly to comprehend, so I get high and fuck that bitch
Praying for the upper hand, I hope that he hear my prayers
Devil really want my soul, he gon' keep it in his lair
Me, I'm just gon' keep a pole, paranoia in the air
Everybody getting killed, I won't be a part of it
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup, then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
If I take too many Perc's, then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup, then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt
