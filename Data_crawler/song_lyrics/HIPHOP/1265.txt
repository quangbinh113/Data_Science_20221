Song Name: Sky Walker (feat. Travis Scott)
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Bull, bull, bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Captain is still, catch a wave, roll us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm outstandin' so I stand out (stand out)
I'm more bathed than a bathhouse
Top Gun, on my Tom Cruise
I play for keeps and I don't lose
You're gonna love it 'cause you're cool as a breeze (cool as a breeze)
So pick a poison, yeah, I got what you need (got what you need)
Nonchalant, got the green on rotation
All night, we gon' keep it psychedelic like a.
Captain is still, catch a wave, roll us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Yeah, yeah
Wildin' on my haters (yah, hey)
In my 23s, havin' a Jordan moment
Wildin' with the paper (it's lit)
Ice all on my chain, I'ma (let me pretend to say ya)
I just popped two, I'll be stayin' up (yeah, yeah)
Hangin' with the gang, that shit dangerous, yeah
I can fuck you with my chain, you should take a look, yeah, yeah
Come and catch a wave, take one out my cup, yeah
Damn near OD'd (OD'd)
Damn the police, woah (hey)
WIldin' in SV, yeah (hey)
Movin' up your street, yeah (straight up)
When we on the creek
And bring sand to the beach (alright)
Ain't no day, ain't no night
Made no plans, ain't no sleep
Yeah, yeah
Captain is still, catch a wave, roll us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up
I was vivid, but I'm better now (hey)
All gains I've been wrappin' up (hey)
Quick to dead the bull like a matador (hey)
Right now I'm higher up than Canada (hey), oh
Captain is still, catch a wave, roll us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up, oh
(Shalalala)
Got the baes lookin' at me like it's dinnertime (lalalala)
I know she vegan, but she want the steak tonight, yeah (shalalala)
And I smile like a saint with a sinner's mind (lalalala)
Baby roll it, lick it, love it, daddy blow your mind
Shotgunnin', takin' shots now
Conversation flowin'
Left off, we in the clouds now
Laughin' in the moments
First you put the work in 'til it works out (ohohoh)
Work it out 'til it's turnt out, yeah
