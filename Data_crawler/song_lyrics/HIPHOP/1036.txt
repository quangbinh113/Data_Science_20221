Hahaha, wh-what the fuck?
Je t'aime Trippie Redd (window)
Yeah (I'm shy, oh my God)
Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls, bitch, I feel like cell (cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell (cell, hahaha)
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks
Put 'em in that cell (cell, in that cell)
They can't comprehend that we so real (real, yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (kamehameha)
Crash like Titanic, special beam cannon like I'm Piccolo
I was gettin' bread, lil' bitch, I had to pick a loaf
Throw me in the sun, like I'm Broly, I'm invincible
Put my codeine in the freezer, smokin' on this Nimbus cloud
Twin Glocks, Gohan, Krillin nigga, but I am not kiddin' round
Halo on my head when I hit her in the spirit realm
Fat nigga, Majin Buu, I'm eatin', never gave a fuck
Spirit bomb my wrist, lil' bitch, 'cause I been blowin' up
Sippin' that Wock' and 'Tussin, hit the fusion dance (aah), gang
Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls, bitch, I feel like cell (cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell (cell, hahaha)
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks
Put 'em in that cell (cell, in that cell)
They can't comprehend that we so real (real, yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (kamehameha)
And I feel like Coola, 'cause I'm the coolest
Mr. Satan, number one shoota
Spike Devilman 'cause I'm the boolest
Master Roshi, I can teach you how to do it
And I travel galaxies like a God, I'm Lord Beerus
Collect the Dragon Balls and wish for a new Urus
Keep that heater, Super Saiyan, bitch, like I'm Vegeta
Prince of all Saiyans, I ain't playin' from the future
Keep that steel on me, like I'm Trunks (okay)
That Wock' and 'Tussin, hit the fusion dance (aah), gang
Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls, bitch, I feel like cell (cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell (cell, hahaha)
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks
Put 'em in that cell (cell, in that cell)
They can't comprehend that we so real (real, yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah)
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (kamehameha)
