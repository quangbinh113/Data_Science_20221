Song Name: DRAWS
Yeah, uh
Somebody tell me "Sit down," I'm a dawg
Came with some money, I left with her drawers (mm)
They like, "No GPS," I get lost
Keep your number, I'm never gon' call (yeah)
I keep it player, you know I'm a kicker
I'm kickin' s- like a ball (Mm)
By myself, poppin' s- at the mall
I ain't worried 'bout n- at all
I ain't duckin' s- but broke n- and the law (yes, sir)
Paper chasin' broke b-, get 'em off (woo-ooh)
And we ain't never had s-, look at the car
A n- could've bought a crib for what it cost
The police, they keep hatin' (yeah)
I know she ain't love me, so I prolly bought her a cheap bracelet
H- say the love you today
Have a whole 'nother bae in a weekend (mm-mm), it's crazy
Hm, I wonder why my b- get mad if pull up to the crib with Mercedes (with who?)
I'm talkin' 'bout a Benz, lil' n-
Match with the whip, twins, lil' n- (okay)
Back in it, hop out with two irons (let's go)
I don't listen to n-, got mute on (shh)
Heard that rap n- don't know how to use his
I know how to use mine (go)
Somebody tell me "Sit down," I'm a dawg
Came with some money, I left with her drawers (mm)
They like, "No GPS," I get lost (brrt, brrt, brrt)
Keep your number, I'm never gon' call (yeah)
I keep it player, you know I'm a kicker
I'm kickin' s- like a ball (that's what I kick)
By myself, poppin' s- at the mall (yeah, n-, let's go)
I ain't worried 'bout n- at all
