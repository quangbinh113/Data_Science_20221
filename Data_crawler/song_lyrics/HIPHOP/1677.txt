Song Name: Double Down
All them members got they own money, you can challenge us
How you spend a 130,000 on a challenger
This is Demon, I done turned my partner into my manager
Close another deal for 20 mill, that LaFerrari coming
I put glue on both sides of the ball, I know I'll never fumble
I'm alive and ain't doing no time, so I'm forever humble
Different kind, I'm one of them guys, she gone forever love me
He a child, I'm letting him slide, can get him whacked for nothin'
I'm the boss, the one who they call when they lacking something
I'm in charge, I'll stand forward, can't go back for nothing
Big dog, I'm a real problem, you niggas little puppies
Big swagger, bag mash, we be all lovey-dovey
She kneel to my feet but bitches sneaky, you would never know
He done put the people in the beef, I still can't let it go
Ain't losin' no sleep but if I did I ain't gone let it show
I planted my seeds in the streets and I just let it grow
Had to double down 11 rounds, I'm super cautious
I preach to the streets, they pay me cash, I'm taking offers
I'm on all they ass I'm sittin' back I'm taking off
So much Hermes I can tell you if they fake or nah
Good relationships with all the plugs, I try to never owe them
Had to switch it up give up my phones so they can keep it going
Blicky kind of shy, don't take it off, you know I keep it on
Watch me shake the world and wake up everyone who is sleeping on me
Had to cut my blood off too many people leaching on me
Paranoid, I see strange cars and get to reaching for it
I'm from where you turn into the plug, you get a decent number
Disappointed, they acting Disloyal, I keep it 100
It's a process, long as I'm in charge, just know you coming home
Rock hella stones, used to come up short but now my money long
Won't tell them wrong, this shit ain't no game
You can't get back them boys forever gone
Too many dead contacts in my telephone
She kneel to my feet but bitches sneaky, you would never know
He done put the people in the beef, I still can't let it go
Ain't losing no sleep but if I did, I ain't gone let it show
I planted my seeds in the streets and I just let it grow
Had to double down 100 rounds, I'm super cautious
I preach to the streets, they play me cash, I'm taking offers
I'm on all they ass, I'm sitting back, I'm taking off
So much Hermes I can tell you if they fake or nah
I done beat the odds but putting my people on my favorite part
Soon as we catch, dog he gone get robbed, he buck he getting popped
People say I'm hot as fuck, I told them I'm just getting started
Went from hanging on the corner, I'm tryning to buy my whole apartments
Money coming in, it makes you fall out with your closest partner
Everyone come to me with they pity story they know I got it
You did what I did and you only have shit then you supposed to pop it
Could've moved to LA and left everybody
Spent a quarter Milli on a Richard since they all watching
I come from the projects, I got money stuffed in all pockets
Icebox lit, diamond chain hit like a water faucet
If I ever told you I love you then we forever locked in
She kneel to my feet but bitches sneaky, you would never know
He done put the people in the beef, I still can't let it go
Ain't losin' no sleep but if I did I ain't gone let it show
I planted my seeds in the streets and I just let it grow
Had to double down 11 rounds, I'm super cautious
I preach to the streets, they pay me cash, I'm taking offers
I'm on all they ass I'm sittin' back I'm taking off
So much Hermes I can tell you if they fake or nah
