Song Name: Up The Side (feat. Young Thug)
Wheezy outta here
Voice of the Heroes of the Streets
Young Spider checkin' in
Uh, big faces, little faces, mix it up
Everywhere you see me, I got the semi tucked
Gave her a rack the first day, now she look like a prostitute
I got a really bad, bad, bad bitch tyin' my shoes (yeah), huh
I put it up the first five years, so how the fuck can I really lose?
I learned to wipe my face with these dollar bills and all of 'em blue (woah)
I was dyin' those with the really expensive crevices (ha)
Gettin' millions, who the fuck better than?
And I'm ill like a reverend (yah)
Wearin' ho all over her back and swappin' teams like a letterman
I'm celibate (ayy), no settlement (ayy), I'm fly as hell, I'm pelican
When you die, it's irrelevant (oh), I live in every sense (oh)
I got the settlement (oh-oh)
I went from shuttle to the medal to the Rolls truck
I got the Smith & Wess' in Cali' and I showed up
Guess I never growed up (ye-ye)
Half a million on me right now
Hundred thousand on me, count it right now
Know you run up, you get gunned down
Shit get sweet, the label doin' anything now
Half a band, purple Benzo
And I'm gone, it's a wrap
Breakin' out 'cause you scared to run your bags
Coach had told me, "Run it up the side"
So let's run it up the side (side)
Street nigga with elite status (yeah)
I done popped me a pink Addy (yeah)
Young nigga make killin' a fetish (yeah)
I know a scammer who'll leak your addy (let's get it)
I'm lowkey so I ain't sleepin' in the tele' (let's get it)
Wockesha done blew up my belly (drank)
I'm a street nigga, stay outta my business
My bitch gon' stunt with a careless (yeah)
They say I lost my mind when I'm off these drugs, I go to sleep (when I go to sleep)
I was fucked up when my dawg had caught a bond, I couldn't reach (couldn't raeach)
Gotta watch out for the ones you call your dawgs, 'cause he a leech (facts)
I done fucked up my whole profit, made it back in one week
I scream, "Free Nine," like nine times, I'ma always carry my nine
They shot my cousin in from the blind side, they didn't even look him in his eye
You got a gun and you ain't slide, I swear that shit gon' kill my vibe
I keep braggin' about the other side 'cause them niggas keep dyin'
(Oh, no, no, no, no, no)
I'm the Voice of the Hero
(Yeah, I know Thug the coach, let's get it)
Half a million on me right now
Hundred thousand on me, count it right now
Know you run up, you get gunned down
Shit get sweet, the label doin' anything now
Half a band, purple Benzo
And I'm gone, it's a wrap
Breakin' out 'cause you scared to run your bags
Coach had told me, "Run it up the side"
So let's run it up the side (up the side)
Run it up for miles (miles)
I don't get no help in stores, I'm really havin' style
Knew I was gon' be the man one day when I was a child
Used to try to serve everyone, I'm pipin' up the crowd now
Steady goin', they know I'm the one, they gotta bow down
I'm from the city, she call me country, she like the way I sound
It's a lotta people lookin' up to me, and I ain't gon' let 'em down
Lil' bro nem can get whatever from me, I had 'em sellin' pounds
It's crazy now, I'm real big on privacy, I come from public housing
Just work with me, I need a little time, I'm tryna fix up my life
That shit was real good, I can't lie, but I had to sacrifice
I'm focused now
And the shit that don't matter won't even cross my mind
A lot of shit is startin' to look different, I opened up my eyes
And I done changed my life from just watchin', I owe a lot to slime
I twist all my problems in the wood and I get real high
Some folks just don't get it, you can't make 'em, I was still tryin'
I had to realize
Half a million on me right now (right now)
Hundred thousand on me, count it right now
Know you run up, you get gunned down
Shit get sweet, the label doin' anything now
Half a band, purple Benzo
And I'm gone, it's a wrap
Breakin' out 'cause you scared to run your bags
Coach had told me, "Run it up the side"
So let's run it up the side
