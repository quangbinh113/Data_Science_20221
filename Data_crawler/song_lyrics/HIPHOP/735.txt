Song Name: Don
Banger
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger
Yeah
Sippin' Don, Don, Don, sippin' Dom, Dom Pérignon
Baby, I'm gone, gone, gone, go infinity and beyond
Baby, I'm the one, one, one, they was tryna count me out
Had a couple real ones with me when I was in the motherfuckin' drought
Got a couple steppers that'll lay your face down on the motherfuckin' ground
Don't think I won't do it myself, nigga, just been a while
Mama ain't raise no sucker, lil' nigga, .30, let it howl
You are what you drink, so I guess I got a dirty mouth
Bitch, I'm from up north but I like chillin' in the dirty south
You niggas ain't gettin' money, lil' nigga, you still trapped in the house
My niggas movin' that white and them P's out the trap house
Maybach so big, it's so hard to back out
Talk down on the gang, that's the type of shit make you crash out
200 on the 'Rari dashboard, little nigga, yeah, mash out
Don't do no Tom Ford but I got an Audemars on my wrist
Get a Richard Mille, they're 200, give the AP to Chris
My niggas out here trappin', yeah, every day we take a damn risk
Pneumonia in my neck, yeah, pneumonia in my fists
Every day I feel blessed, no stress, baby, I feel bliss
R.I.P Juice WRLD, free Melly and Melvin, baby, "6 Kiss"
I'ma put the Corvette and the Bentley in the shop, get wide-body kits
How dare you test my gangster, lil' nigga? Know that we body shit
Always talkin' tough on the internet but ain't really 'bout shit
Big Bird in this bitch, I'm the Ferragamo Falcon
Sippin' Don, Don, Don, sippin' Dom, Dom Pérignon
Baby, I'm gone, gone, gone, go infinity and beyond
Baby, I'm the one, one, one, they was tryna count me out
Had a couple real ones with me when I was in the motherfuckin' drought
Got a couple steppers that'll lay your face down on the motherfuckin' ground
Don't think I won't do it myself, nigga, just been a while
Mama ain't raise no sucker, lil' nigga, .30, let it howl
You are what you drink, so I guess I got a dirty mouth
