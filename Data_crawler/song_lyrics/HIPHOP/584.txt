Song Name: Trapped In The Sun
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I'm trapped in the sun
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make blunt
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons
(Future), yeah
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I'm
Trapped in the sun (for when I'm trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I
Couldn't make blunt (when I couldn't make blunt)
I gave there plug to my nigga
I gave the game to my sons (game to my son)
You need to learn the recipe, gotta put a three on a one (yeah, yeah)
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected (yeah, yeah)
I get bored, I might give away a necklace (yeah, yeah)
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I'm
Trapped in the sun (for when I'm trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I
Couldn't make blunt (when I couldn't make blunt)
He wanna be a superstar, I bought my magazine
For his birthday, got him a Glock, hold more than seventeen (on God)
I've been on Adderall, I've been on gasoline
I had some Hatians with me, they out there pokin' beans
I did new registration, I did some new Celine
They line up at the woo, doctor, actin' like some fiends
I microwave the pound, I never cut the lean
I got dope in my blood, it's full of Promethazian
You need some molly in your drink
To boost your self-esteem (yeah, yeah)
I'm in Amiri everyday, said "Fuck them Levi jeans" (yeah, yeah)
He wanna be a superstar, I bought my magazine
I can't be a role model, 'cause I'm a trappin' king
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I'm
Trapped in the sun (for when I'm trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I
Couldn't make blunt (when I couldn't make blunt)
I gave there plug to my nigga
I gave the game to my sons (game to my son)
You need to learn the recipe, gotta put a three on a one (yeah, yeah)
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected (yeah, yeah)
I get bored, I might give away a necklace (yeah, yeah)
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I'm
Trapped in the sun (for when I'm trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I
Couldn't make blunt (when I couldn't make blunt)
I cop the Porsche and it make me more ambitious (yeah, yeah)
Got foreign cars in my driveway, yeah, I'm a misfit (yeah, yeah)
Pullin' up on four, down bad, I was scarred (down bad, I was scarred)
Had to buy me a car (had to buy me a car)
Livin' life the largest (livin' life the largest)
Tryna avoid these charges (avoid these charges)

You drownin', flawless (you drownin', flawless)
Seven-figure endorsements (yeah, yeah)
