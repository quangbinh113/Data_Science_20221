Song Name: Voice of the Heroes
TouchofTrent be wilding with it
Missed out on my kid's life for a year and I gotta accept it
Certain days niggas never came to my shows, and I felt neglected
Growing up, seeing my uncle dying in his bed, that shit made me reckless
Pouring up, and I ain't never sharing my meds, and I ain't being extra
And I paid like two of my niggas bonds before I bought a necklace
I done seen my brother stack his bricks up, and it look like Tetris
Having real shootout up on the 'e-way, you can't miss your exit
Told the bitch she can't hide the smell of my cologne, she gotta go change her panties
Take care of your family and them kids 'cause I'm too big on family
Fuck them fast cars, before that shawty and 'em was gon' slide in Camrys
I'ma get my lawyer an extra dub because it come in handy
Felt like I'ma vomit off this Perc' 'cause I don't take no
Voice of the heroes
I'm the voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
See, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero
Baby, he the hero
I'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero
But Baby, he the hero
I wasn't even tryna be no idol
I put niggas on, and all of a sudden they feel entitled
Put the barbers on 'em, you only get this kit when you got a title
I'm exhausted, I been working shift-to-shift, but I keep fighting
Not my fault if I don't miss your likeness
And I'm still with Ced still
We the ones, for real, for real
I just got 200 for a walk through, I'll still drill
High-speed chases in a Dodge Stratus, I can still peel 'em
I be tryna put on a smile for 'em, but I don't really feel 'em
I just spent 350 on a Richard for the second time
I showed all my niggas in the trenches it's a better life
Never get too big for me to listen, I'll take your advice
I just told Durk, "We rich forever if we play it right"
Just keep on being the voice, I'll be the hero
And everything I got is a profit, started with zero
I can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from
And I'm just getting started, relax, wait 'til I warm up
I done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma
Everywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?
Police caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up
Ain't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up
Yeah, flood my system with these Percies
Took the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirting
I just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin
All this shit these bitches texting me, just do it in person
Yeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Percies
Put the phone on DND, I'm somewhere in her cervix
I just slimed a nigga out today, but it was worth it
I switch cars like bitches switch they purses
I slow down on features, I do verses if they worth it now
This shit done got deep and, let's be honest, we can't work it out
Peeped that lately you been acting funny, wonder what it's 'bout
This shit really in me, hope you never doubt it, on gang
Voice of the heroes
I'm the voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
See, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero
Baby, he the hero
I'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero
But Baby, he the hero
