Song Name: pg baby - Remix
Uh, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh
Keep them trucks up on the railing just a little bit longer
Landing make you stronger
Skin to skin with everything I pondered
So we don't take dishonor for that
Run all my commas, out the way and it won't be a problem
All my brothers climbing, we repellent to the bottom
Every second spent to never have another autumn
That was back when everyday was solemn
Now they falling under me I'm leading every column
Meter doing jumping jacks, I'm leaning on the pedal
So much steam left on the asphalt, they fiending to say hello
Every season Imma blast off and reach that different level
Got my head up on a swivel and my hand close to the metal
Get the medal
Bring it back to Largo, that P.G. baby never settle
Easy day to get him silent tryna meddle
Veil adjacent to the pot, you bet not touch it 'til it settle
And I'm hitting every shot, boy that's them fucking fundamentals
Push it with conviction, hit this mission on the code
If they said that Veil was missing, that shit fiction on my soul
Ain't no permission I envision giving me a simple road
I'm gon' take that trek alone
I'm gon' get it back in gold
Never fitting in that mold
My reflection 1 of 1, these niggas sectioned into rows
My perception one and done, it's to the next soon as you fold
I attest I'm at they neck, I'm right above they collarbone
Bitch I cant trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell u ain't about to win
Bitch I cant trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win
Uh, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh
Swim good through my stream of consciousness, so ponder this
Wondering what it was like to grow up in my pond I guess
Life is just a sandy beach
It's sitting on the sands of time
So with these mighty hands of mine
I'm close to Adam's most Devine
Float the mind on banks of memories
We had no chimneys
It's always hot
Frozen cups & quarter juices hit the spot
Almost forgot
Football in front the crib with no socks
And barely no shoes
Running back and forth on the block
With all the locals
Fist fights had us all falling out with each other
It's silly cause they my niggas but really they are brothers
In turn they all made me tougher but rougher around the edges
But most importantly see what's greater over the hedges
My name is DC baby
I ain't from D.C. baby
My dawg from PG, baby
And I'm from that Z3 Baby
Carol City stand up
Dade County stand up
You don't wanna drown in this wave
Throw your hands up
Bitch I cant trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win
Bitch I cant trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win
Uh, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win
