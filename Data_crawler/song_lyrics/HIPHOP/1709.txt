Song Name: I Donâ€™t Text Back (feat. Yeat)
I upgraded my linen, huh, DOP, I don't do no simpin', uh
I really don't want you up inside my mentions (Ayo, Bans, what you cooking?)
Give me side, I start diggin', huh
Know you feelin' my inside your kidneys
I had to grind it, ain't take me a minute
They was talkin' 'bout me 'cause my clothes was dingy
Hand me downs, I used to wear from my cousin
I used to ride up the slimes in the Pontiac
I got this shit in position, I'm quarterback
Pendants I put 'round my neck, make her Cartier
Cartier watch, it's not even a starter pack
All in my sleep, I get stack after stack
I get the money like that
Huh, hit it from the back, she like that
Hit me trippin', I don't even text back
Lookin', new clothes, just pickin', tryna turn up my swag
I want the money like that
I'm gon' get it, watch how quick I come back (wow, wow, wow)
I get the money like that
They wan' see my swag, gettin' to the bag
No jetlag, straight like that (Huh, huh) Uh
I mix the Oxy' with X, bitch, I'm booted like, "Uh"
Swervin' that daily, bitch, I'm gon' crank like, "Huh"
I got some twizzys, they crazy, they kill you, they get you like, "Huh-huh-huh"
I made a mill' every day of this week, bitch, I'm rich, like, "Um-hmm"
I'm in the swerve, I'm in the frog-eyed Bentley (skrrt)
I'm at the top of this shit like I'm Big O, pimpin'
You broke, lil' bitch, we in the big boy league
You still countin' pennies
I was just talkin' to God
I'm fly with the birds, I'm fly with the cranes
I was just talkin' to demon
He told me "Go get it," he told me, "It's endless"
I'm not your friend, twizzy, cousin, bitch, no, I'm not friendly
I just been booted up for like sixty days, bitch, you know I been heavenly (booted up)
And you know that's why I do not reply lil' bitch
So why is you textin' me?
I get the money like that
Huh, hit it from the back, she like that
Hit me trippin', I don't even text back
Lookin', new clothes, just pickin', tryna turn up my swag
I want the money like that
I'm gon' get it, watch how quick I come back (wow, wow, wow)
I get the money like that
They wan' see my swag, gettin' to the bag, No jetlag, straight like that
