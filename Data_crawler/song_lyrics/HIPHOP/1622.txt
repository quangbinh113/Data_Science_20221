Song Name: Bustdown Rollie Avalanche
(Ayy, Draco)
You know what the fuck goin' on, man
Big whole lot of gang shit, man
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told you, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
I ran up thirty, on thirty, on thirty
When I'm in the streets, I stay too sturdy
Two by two Hellcat, go fast
Four by four, Lamb' truck on the gas
I'm only 18 with big dreams
Before 18, I seen things
Feelin' like a big boss with six rings
Or a bumblebee with six stings
Tired of Bustdown Avalanche?
Remind y'all what my status is
Chain on froze like a mannequin
My prime, I ain't passed that shit
The surface, I'm just scratchin' it
AMG, just copped the whip
The surface, I'm just scratchin' it
AMG, just copped the whip
This one of my gifts, I'm sharin' it
Had to learn how to carry it
Confidence, the scariest (mm-hmm)
Sicker than a variant
Lead these niggas like Harriet
These bitches be so arrogant
Go to the room, get the gun
After that, I'm clearin' it
Ayy, ayy (brrt)
Bustdown, baby, Glockiana (Glockiana)
Presidential like Obama (like Obama)
Where I'm from, we run down runners (come here, come here)
Kill the killers, gun the gunners (brrt, brrt)
Runnin' with snakes and piranhas (run it)
Drac' hit his face like I'm Conor
Cougar bitch, I'm fuckin' on her
Nickname her Donna or Mama (mama)
Nigga, we crop your gang out the picture
Got more shots than some liquor (brrt)
Say you slime but I'm slicker
I kinda move like a lizard (brrt)
Any weather, we we get you, we give a fuck 'bout a blizzard (brrt)
Hit the scene with my niggas
Few choppers, two tinted rentals (brrt, brrt)
Face shot, change his dentals, bury him with some dimples (bury him)
Put you on TV, watch you on the screen like Jimmy Kimmel (Jimmy Live)
Gas prices, they been high
But a full tank how we fill 'em (fill 'em up)
Sent the hit, they don't know who killed 'em (come here)
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told you, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
