Song Name: Love Sick
Shawty, don't go runnin' out on me
Shawty, don't go runnin' out on me, yeah-oh, ay, ay, uh

Bae, don't worry 'bout what I said (I said)
Get that shit out your head (your head)
No way I meant that shit, oh
Don't let it get to your head
Bae, just forget what I said
Shawty, you can just forget about what I said
Think it's best to live without what I said
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
I'm so tired of love songs
I'm so sick of love songs
Shawty, you remember high school when I said
Me and you were right, survivin' 'til the end
You'd be my ride or die until the end
I said until the end, yeah
Baby, cry me a river, float right to the edge
You'll float too, bitch, hope you remember
Could have been love, I don't know, yeah
Love, you can hold my hand and feel safe
You can hop in my car, bae, and we can go
You ain't ever gotta ask, I know you know
I know you know, yeah
Shawty, you can just forget about what I said
Think it's best to live without what I said
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
I'm so tired of love songs
I'm so sick of love songs
Don't worry 'bout what I said (I said)
Get that shit out your head (your head)
No way I meant that shit, oh
Don't let it get to your head
Bae, just forget what I said
