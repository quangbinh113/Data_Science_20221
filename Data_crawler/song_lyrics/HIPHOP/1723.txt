Song Name: Pretty Girls Walk
No matter what the fuck these hoes talking 'bout
Just know you a bad bitch every motherfuckin' time that you wake up and you look in that motherfuckin' mirror
All the pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this, this
Pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this
All the pretty girls walk like
Big Boss Vette (Yeah)
Pull up in a Vette (Skrr)
Flooded out my wrist with some ice around my neck (Water)
Shittin' on my ex (Fuck him)
On to the next (On God)
He know this pussy good 'cause he always come back (Ah)
I like diamonds, shinin', fly me to an island (Whew)
If I say it then you know he gon' buy it (Money)
Foreign, private, designer, stylist (Ooh)
I'll throw a tantrum, now a bitch get childish (Wa, wa)
Go dumb on the dick, know he lovin' the moves (On God)
If I'm fuckin' with him, he ain't fuckin' with you (At all)
Made him blow a bag, spent it all on shoes (Yuh)
'Cause all the pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this, this
Pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this
All the pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this, this
Pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this
All the pretty girls walk like
Walk into this bitch like I got money then (I do)
I came in with some ballers, I ain't come with them (At all)
If I ain't got no section, I ain't comin' in (The fuck)
Bottle after bottle, tell 'em spend it then (Where the bottles then?)
I got hittas on call, yeah, I got hard (Yeah)
Nails too long to be fightin' these broads (The fuck)
Pussy stay clean (Ooh)
A nigga gon' fiend (Come here)
A whole lotta power in these YSL jeans (Pussy)
If I let you hit it, better hit it from the back (Bend that thang over)
Wanna take me out, nigga, take me to the bank (Money)
Balencis on my feet 'cause it's wetter than sank (Yeah)
'Cause all the pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this, this
Pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this
All the pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this, this
Pretty girls walk like this, this, this, this
All the pretty girls walk like
