Song Name: Immortal
21
I feel like the motherfuckin' Grim Reaper
The biggest smoke blower
Put a motherfuckin' chimney on my stick
Brand new MAK-90 with the drum attached (drum)
You a shit talker, we got drums for that (on God)
Tryna fist fight? Boy, you dumb for that (stupid)
You gon' get a bullet in yo' lung for that (stupid)
Draco get to kickin' like Liu Kang (21)
F&N on me in the Mulsanne (straight up, straight up)
Glock 19 and a blue flame (straight up, straight up)
I was strapped when I slid inside your boo thang (on God)
21 immortal, we'll never die (21)
Loyal to my brothers (yeah), I'll never lie (on God)
Call me bird dog 'cause I cheat, and I'm fly (straight up)
And I love winnin', I'm upset if it's a tie (on God)
Get you off the ground just to knock you to the floor (yeah)
Let's go blow for blow (yeah), let's go toe to toe (straight up)
When it's time to battle, they don't never ever show (21)
When it's time to battle, I'm the first one at the door (21)
At the door with a Draco
Don't nobody move, I don't wanna have to blow
Rappin' ass niggas get spinned at they show
That's why I need some help, I got a fetish for the smoke
It get fatal in the bottom, used to rumble in the den (21)
Hit him with a combo, gotta finish him (21)
AK make you frown since you think you wanna grin (straight up)
Seems like all the models just be fallin' in my DMs (yeah)
Coolant on the TEC, it get hot like scorpion (hot)
I'll burn his ass, lil' buster
You thought it was straight, I got some chemicals in this magazine
I'll perm his ass (wonk ass nigga)
Wanna be a gangsta, but he misguided (bitch)
I'll learn his ass (on God, nigga)
He went against me, and they call 911 (21)
They had to infirm' his ass (you gon' be next, nigga)
"How many talks you done got popped?" Whole bunch
"How many times you ran from the smoke?" Nigga, not once
Eastside nigga fuckin' all the hoes, and I love guns
Ain't no fucking diamonds in my mouth, nigga, these gold fronts
And we known to handle all the business, nigga, ASAP
Had her at the slaughterhouse, how the fuck you cake that?
Ain't no body shots, nigga, you know I told him face that
Now he in the ocean, heard they hit him in his wave cap
You took your shot, and you missed it (21)
I just beat it up, and you kissed it (ugh)
Took the rap game, and I milked it (yeah)
Took the rap beef, and I killed it
Neck on froze like sub-zero, dawg (straight up)
He wifed a thot, he a hero, dawg (straight up)
All I care about is my dinero, dawg (on God)
Only thing I'm chasing is dineros, dawg (straight up)
Dread-headed killer like Cyrax (21)
Brought a gun to a fist fight like Jax
Nah, fuck that, only thing scare me is a rat (snitch)
Slaughter Gang, pick your poison, dagger or the axe (straight up)
Stand-up guy, they respect my mind (on God)
If you foul out, get a TEC, my nine (straight up)
If you ain't a hunnid, don't text my line (lil' bitch)
If you know you hatin', don't check my life (snitch)
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed a rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she woulda slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco in his corn beef
Choppa cut you up like Kitana (ching, ching)
My choppa in the band, it's a drummer (drum roll)
Russell Westbrook, I was strikin' like the Thunder (woah, woah)
You was somewhere runnin' 'round whinin' to your momma (21)
Y'all play conservative, we gon' send a blick (straight up)
I'm the type to catch a TEC foul, hit him in his shit (on God)
He think he a made man, hit him in the head (pussy)
Don't you try to run now, hit him in the leg (braa!)
People wanna say the stuff I say, but they be scared (pussy)
Jab turn a lightskin pretty boy red (21)
It's a fatality if you try to handle me (yeah)
Real top shotta, don't you ever try to ramp with me (on God)
Got enough bullets that could kill your whole camp with me (grra)
I was bad as hell in school, they even tried to cancel me (21)
I don't like to talk, don't you even try to tongue-wrestle (on God)
And my block good, you'll never get the best of me (straight up)
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed a rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she woulda slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco in his corn beef
