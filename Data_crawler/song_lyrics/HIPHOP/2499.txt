Song Name: Chapters
(You-, you are my, my-, feel me love)
(You-, you are my, my-, feel me love)
Some of these guys just bad on a desktop tryna bring on a 'net war
Me and Elizabeth stood in a wedlock, I don't know why them guys upset for
How can I not shit on my doorstep? Somebody smokin' next door
Z's were white like parmesan and the box is green like pesto pasta
Family first then money comes second, the rest don't matter
They think that I came up quick, they don't know 'bout the rest of the chapters
I'm from where the Jackboys active
Don't sleep with your window open
Don't ever leave your door on the latches
Bro got two, next time that he scores, it's a hattrick
I had a big dream from young, some shit that I done, I couldn't imagine
Why would I dwell on the past? Without that, maybe this wouldn't have happened
Me and the bros in a new environment, I feel like the only one adaptin'
Bro's still ready to wrap man, shank man, some of the guys still trappin'
Uh, in the Shard with the dargs, the starter's prawns, the main is seabass
My darg won't ask for help, that hurts me hard, I don't like when I see that
If YJ run off with your pack, I swear, you won't get that weed back
I don't even care 'bout the rap, I don't even need no feedback
Remember the rap game didn't accept me, now you see the reception
Remember them girls, they try reject me, now they're so quick to come to the bedroom
Remember when my girl left me, and now she gotta cope with depression
I can get over my exes same way I can get over recession
Inflation, I'm ready for that when the prices raisin'
Only thing on my mind was paper, now only thing on my mind is payback
The show that I done today is more than my parents' life savings
Survivors guilt, I'm dealin' with that, so tell me the price, I'll pay that
I feel like buyin' the shop at the job I applied for way back
Remember washin' my body with Fairy Liquid, he ran out of Radox
I'm only human, I still feel sad when I'm sat in the back of a Maybach
I thought that my life was hard 'til I went to the orphanage in Lagos
(You-, you are my, my-, feel me love you)
(You are my, my-, feel me love you)
