Song Name: SICKO MODE
Astro'
Yeah
Sun is down, freezing cold
That's how we already know winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know he don't know nothing else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Going on you with the pick and roll
Young LaFlame, he in sicko mode
(Woo) made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hop in our coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up gimme the loot (gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4:00 a.m. and I'm back up popping with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really selling fruits
And they choking, man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playing for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playing for keeps, don't play us for weak
This shit way too formal, ya'll know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you coming too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke (don't stop, pop that pussy)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we going?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together, I'm the glue
Someone said
Shorty FaceTime me out the blue
Someone said
Play-Play-Playing for keeps
Someone said, motherf-
Someone said
Don't play us for weak
Yeah!

She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bust it to the dance (yeah)
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands
I did half a Xan, 13 hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light, ayy, yeah
Like a light, ayy, yeah, like a light, ayy
Slept through the flight, ayy
Not for the night, ayy

Nothing nice (yeah), baguettes in my ice

Lost my respect, you not a threat
When I shoot my shot, that shit wetty like I'm Sheck (bitch!)
See the shots that I took (ayy), wet like I'm Book (ayy)
Wet like I'm Lizzie, I be spinning Valley, circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (yeah, what?)

She's in love with who I am
