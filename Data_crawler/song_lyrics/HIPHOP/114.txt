Song Name: ASTROTHUNDER
Yeah
Seem like the life I fiend
Seem like the life I fiend's a little distant, yeah
Seems like the life I need
Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Light the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I ride the deep
Do it on repeat, repeat
Sins controlling me, yeah
Angels, halos over me
I need blessings and my peace
You been off the streets, yeah
Wildin' on me, know my G's, we been going for a week
Now you wanna peek, yeah
Hands up, why they tryna reach?
I can't even get that deep
Told you I don't teach, yeah
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach

Infiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah, yeah
Feels like the life I need, yeah
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
