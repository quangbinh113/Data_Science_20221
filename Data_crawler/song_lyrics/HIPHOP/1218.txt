Song Name: man made
Poured up off this syrup, I ain't even think about coughin'
Told her, "You not my only bitch, I probably got some more options"
Better keep that shit proper, better watch your tongue when you talk to me
'Cause I get turned off, had to see a lot of niggas sacrifice, I had to see a lot of niggas cross me
If I tell you I love you, I mean it, you know you can't tell me I ain't tried
All these bitches with they mixed feelings always tryna fuck up the vibe
I work from Monday to Monday, always gon' listen to what my granny say
Proud of myself 'cause I'm self-made, a lot of you niggas is man-made
My niggas say I been hot too long, I probably caught a fever
I get all this guala, look out for my people, I look out for the evils
If a nigga a fraud and he X-ed his self out, then I probably ain't need him
Bulletproof on the motherfuckin' diesel, jumpsuit like Evel Knievel
Bought a fresh Kelly bag for a diva, make a hundred million dollars off Vida
I can never keep all of this shit to myself, so that's why I ain't put on no shelf
I do this shit for my motherfuckin' city, you know how I'm comin'
Especially when they actin' too funny
I get the same love from the crib even when I go out to London
I be kickin' shit like kung-fu, keep the green on my like Jumanji
We got a couple hoes out in Trinidad, we don't fumble bags, we ain't clumsy
I done already told you that I work hard from a Monday to a Monday
In a Maybach-Maybach, fuckin' with some Gunplay
Poured up off this syrup, I ain't even think about coughin'
Told her, "You not my only bitch, I probably got some more options"
Better keep that shit proper, better watch your tongue when you talk to me
'Cause I get turned off, had to see a lot of niggas sacrifice, I had to see a lot of niggas cross me
If I tell you I love you, I mean it, you know you can't tell me I ain't tried
All these bitches with they mixed feelings always tryna fuck up the vibe
I work from Monday to Monday, always gon' listen to what my granny say
Proud of myself 'cause I'm self-made, a lot of you niggas is man-made
Take a bitch out different coast-es, I was on a private 'fore COVID (Ayy)
When we slide to the Lear, either I'ma Maybach or I'ma Rolls it
We Givenchy all the way down to the toes, this a real lifestyle we chose
I keep on my jewelry, she keep on her jewelry whenever we havin' some sex
And it's too wet, shawty like X
She get right wet, give her pipe, yes
Told her pop her pussy like a Tesla, can you keep it tighter than my schedule?
God bless a nigga, I'm a great one, I be tired of countin' up these decimals
Poured up off this syrup, I ain't even think about coughin'
Told her, "You not my only bitch, I probably got some more options"
Better keep that shit proper, better watch your tongue when you talk to me
'Cause I get turned off, had to see a lot of niggas sacrifice, I had to see a lot of niggas cross me
If I tell you I love you, I mean it, you know you can't tell me I ain't tried
All these bitches with they mixed feelings always tryna fuck up the vibe
I work from Monday to Monday, always gon' listen to what my granny say
Proud of myself 'cause I'm self-made, a lot of you niggas is man-made
