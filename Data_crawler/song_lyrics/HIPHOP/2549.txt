Song Name: Aang
Ayy, hopping out the water like Aang with my gang, nigga
Got that fire like Aang with my gang, nigga
Air a nigga out like Aang with my gang, nigga
Movin' that rock like Aang with my gang, nigga
Uh, I was on the block like Dwayne
Takin' the bus and we hop in the train
Movin' that rock like Dwayne
From the westside and my grandpapa went to Crane, nigga
My whole life had changed
When I seen Cam in the range
Dressin' in pink, in a blink I think I'm safe
Dressin' like *NSYNC, jumpin' on stage, nigga
Bro said to act my age
It ain't no act and the pack light beige, right where I stayed
They was havin' gang shootouts everyday like a action of ragе, nigga
No more actin' afraid
On the corner likе a rat in a maze
Goin' through phases
Pull up like the bad guy in anime and run yo fade, nigga (ayy)
Hoppin' out the water like Aang with my gang, nigga
Got that fire like Aang with my gang, nigga
Air a nigga out like Aang with my gang, nigga
Movin' that rock like Aang (ha-ha-ha-ha)
With my gang, nigga (yeah, ayy)
"Nigga, nigga, nigga" like Trinidad James
With my chains, nigga
Can't find me, I'm in the cave
Saddam Hussein, nigga
Actually, actually, that was, uhh, aw fuck
What's his name, nigga?
Hold on, hold on, l-let me get for real, let me get for real
I was just playin', nigga (yeah)
The time that'll tick
I hustle like a father of six
My heart is like a bottomless pit
I might Prada the fit
'Cause I'm proud of the shit
I accomplished with all of my accomplices
When the sun in the city come out, we get louder
Countin' the days, I'll put that on my calendar
You can count on one hand who you call on it's
Like a phone that just ran out of data (shawty)
I was on the block like Shaq
Had to tuck the work right by my sack
Money on the mind, that's all, no cap
Sowed up like beanie
Them girls, them sugar, big nigga like snacks
These niggas pussy, heart on snatch
Messy, they smear like pap
No hesi', tap-tap, tween-tween with the team
Early caffeine, I'm mean for cream
Don't too many really like Black
That's straight, they trippin', vacay, can't kick it
Outstanding, ain't sittin', might fap
Ayy, do me truly how I'm comin'
Doobies glued me, I still I run it
Max out like Goofy, dad, I'll son ya
I'm appalled, chop tree like Bunyan
Shed a tear smokin' out the onion (ayy)
Hoppin' out the water like Aang with my gang, nigga
Got that fire like Aang with my gang, nigga
Air a nigga out like Aang with my gang, nigga
Movin' that rock like Aang with my gang, nigga
If they take me right now
Burnin' it down in my name
Dante inferno, a level of flames
All of my aim, it been the same
I was internalizing all the pain
Me and my niggas been buildin' the frame out
Same routes, I was with foes, solid and lo's
Fightin' some niggas then beating they brains out
Rearrangin' how I came out
Motherfucker in a lane now
Everything in my range I put on gang
You ain't reliable, that ain't gon' change
Beggin' for handouts in the rain
Now you just living for less
Stay on your Pivot, go get ya respect, nigga
