Song Name: No Regrets (feat. Don Toliver)
(Oh, oh, yeah) yeah
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (oh, oh)
DA got that dope
I'm screamin' out no regrets
You been through the hardest spot, ego, the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm
Screamin' out no regrets
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit
I ain't havin' regrets
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm-
Yeah, they miss the old me (yeah)
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at them with no regrets, and I'm Hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moo Dee
Never took months to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Shady, minds of a God, I been insane
Pen game, like I just stuck in the tenth frame (screamin' out no regrets)
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put it into to me yet (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
You been through the hardest spot, ego, the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm
Screamin' out no regrets (yeah, no apologies, ain't takin' shit back)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit
I ain't havin' regrets
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give
Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt
Shoulda never made a response to the disdain, for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to a rose without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those who I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin'
Foes are gonna feel like they're in the throws of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill
Can't do it, nah (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets, took it all)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm
Screamin' out no regrets (yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (yeah)
I ain't havin' regrets
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm-
