Swirv
(This is a Melo beat) huh, wait
Yeah (ahahaha)
Soo, soo (woo), woo
Woo (grrt), woo, skrrt (blaow)
Woo (blaow), woo
Light it up for a 50 ball (50)
Then I spend it on your bitch (bitch)
And my charm like a crystal ball (crystal)
When I pull up, make a wish
Makin' a, makin' a profit (woo)
Big boy, big boy, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Pour me a drink, and it's toxic (drank)
New York drippin', it's straight out the faucet (drip)
Pour me a drink, and it's toxic (drank)
New York drippin', it's straight out the faucet (drip)
Nigga can't bought it, they cop it (right)
I be too stiff, I give them the Heisman (stiff)
Nigga be talkin' 'bout slidin' (woo)
I screw the tip and shoot 'em in silence (grrah)
Brand-new coupe, no mileage (woo)
I show the gang and we highfivin' (gang) (Offset) (uh)
She give me face in the Wraith (face)
This semi, it shoot by the trey (grrow)
Moonwalkin', my diamonds gon' skate (moonwalkin')
They tried to revive him too late (too late)
I put a cape on the Drac' (Drac')
Put a thot on the plot, she bake (plot)
Surprised, it came out a cake (surprised)
I put kids on the eyes of your bae (hey)
He made it to trial and flaked (flaked)
100K, he get whacked off the gate (whacked)
I mix purple codeine by the eight (codeine)
Grabbed the scope, lined him up like a tape (lined him up)
Back to back, Lamborghini replay (back to back)
I fishbowl the coupes, watch 'em hate (coupe)
The guts, it's red, Kool-Aid (guts)
We got sticks, in case you wan' play (grrah)
Whoa, a bigger bankroll than me (whoa), these hoes will lose their soul (soul)
Suicide doors and TMZ postin' me (post)
Make them hoes take off their clothes (hoes)
I crashed in my woes, they powdered their nose (woes)
They gettin' exposed, they fuckin' the bros
Chauffeur, open the door in the Rolls (Rolls), toast him, bask him in, reload it
Light it up for a 50 ball (50), then I spend it on your bitch (bitch)
And my charm like a crystal ball (crystal), when I pull up, make a wish
Makin' a, makin' a profit, big boy, big boy, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Pour me a drink, and it's toxic (drank)
New York drippin', it's straight out the faucet (drip)
Pour me a drink, and it's toxic (drank)

Hella rocks in my socks (oh-oh), hella guns in my brief (oh-oh)
If a nigga movin' wock (wock), that's what he gon' see (oh-oh)
All the Woos poppin' out the cut (oh-oh), totin' .33s (oh-oh)
She say, "You're dark-skinned and handsome" (yeah)
"You a gorgeous little gangsta" (huh)
She like, "You always dripped up in Dior"
"And all your diamonds dancin'" (huh, huh, huh)
She like, "You swift but run-up" (oh-oh)
I tell her, "Work", Rihanna (oh-oh)
Everything white, Madonna (oh-oh)
Only hand-selected diamonds
Brand-new Richard Mille (Mille) (oh-oh)
Cost a milli' (oh-oh)
Yeah, big old ticket (oh-oh), woo, woo, woo, woo
Look, I always knew how to ball
Brodie wet it up if I make the call
He ain't gon hesitate to shake it up
'Cause he know I got that nigga if he fall
Light it up for a 50 ball (50), then I spend it on your bitch (bitch)
And my charm like a crystal ball (crystal), when I pull up, make a wish

Red, blue, and white, oh, there go the cops
Take 'em on a chase 'cause we never stop (12)
I just been countin' up cheese a lot (cheese)
We the one got the block fever hot (ha)
I call the pot Larry Holmes (why?)
And call the spatula Mike 'cause it beat the pot (beat it)
Get you a bag on your own, never let nobody see you're not (never)
Niggas that lead the block, get caught, then we can't leave the block (can't leave)
Makin' no profit, boy you need to stop it, get out, leave the block (go)
They say, "When you make it, don't go back" (no)
But some niggas need to come on
Count up a ticket, I knew I would get it (count)
Call up the plug, and he tell me to send it (grrt)
They think I'm a menace, they leavin' no witness
Just popped me a Perc', ain't been high in a minute (high)
Said he want smoke, well, fuck it, let's get it (go)
Niggas be thinkin' they God, they trippin' (they trippin')
Everythin' cool (it's all cool) 'til somebody end up missin' (grrt)
