Song Name: Armed & Dangerous
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chopsquad
Police steady watching me, every day they clocking me
Every day they clocking me

(ChopsquadDJ on the beat so it's a banger)
Police steady watching me, every day they clocking me
Red alert, armed and dangerous, I keep that Glock on me
And I ain't looking for no trouble, I'm just looking out for me
'Cause I done did shit that niggas ain't talking 'bout no rapping beef
Boy, I'm talking tragedies, massacres, casualties
Shit that I can't even remember, bet they remember me
Shit that happened late in December, I bring that Winter heat
Niggas dying the whole October, the real Halloween
Back to back funerals, it's them or us, it's him or me
Don't get booked 'cause ain't no bond money
We doing this shit for free
If he told then that ain't my homie, that lil' nigga weak
If I miss, ain't going to sleep, I'm in the street, we play for keeps
2011, August 11th, R.I.P. Odee
August 9th, two days before, I turned 17
21 to 45, I'm like what the fuck that mean?
You fighting an armed robbery shorty, that's what they offering
My lil' brother getting big, my uncle got that cough again
He been smoking crack since I was born, that monkey stalking him
I used to stay up late at granny crib just to talk to him
When I was locked up
God knocked on his door and told him walk with Him
Back to this drilling shit
Sosa started rapping now the war going viral
Boy, this bitch cracking
Boy, they ass lacking
Hit they block twice, a lot of booming, no jamming
His mama pop out like, "Oh God damn, what happened?"
This the type of shit happen, the life of a savage
You ain't right, you get left, you slipped up, you ain't having
Not your blood, ain't your cuz, you my son, I'm your daddy
(You my son, I'm your daddy)
Police steady watching me, every day they clocking me
Red alert, armed and dangerous, I keep that Glock on me
And I ain't looking for no trouble, I'm just looking out for me
'Cause I done did shit that niggas ain't talking 'bout no rapping beef
Boy, I'm talking tragedies, massacres, casualties
Shit that I can't even remember, bet they remember me
Shit that happened late in December, I bring that Winter heat
Niggas dying the whole October, the real Halloween
