Song Name: Jerry Sprunger (with T-Pain)
You do, you do
You do, you do
You do, you do
You do
You do, you do
You do, you do
You do, you do
She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every weekend, shoulda seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil' mama gettin' it in all on her worst day
Lil mama gettin' it in
She fit the school and the gym into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I'm all in the bed, she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me baby, it's for the night
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, you, you, you
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You unknot me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, you, you, you
I'm like a faucet, baby, I'ma buss' you
Too, too, too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause
Ooh, you did it, ooh, did it ooh
I already know what it takes to get into you
Ooh, bring it back, she put that pussy on me
She know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap yo, I make it clap yo
I had them haters asking how you up in that Rolls
And had them umbrellas coming out of locked doors
Have the front doors open up like the back doors
I'll be like, you ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini
On the beach sittin' up
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us
She said, that champagne nasty, spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks want tapes I am not gone
But it's been five times, you ain't catch on
Maybe on the next song
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, you, you, you
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You unknot me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, you, you, you
I'm like a faucet, baby, I'ma buss' you too
Too, too, too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause
I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you
I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you
You're so sexy to me
Sexy to me
Give a damn who your ex be
I be flyin' to you jet speed
You sexy
Make me wanna get messy
Make me wanna give it to you all day, all night
In the broad light, give a damn who catch me
You sexy
Sprung, girl, you get me
Got me doing things I never do
And it's true
