Song Name: Make Em Say (feat. Latto)
Ayy, and we know some good good make 'em, make 'em say
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
(And we know some good good make them niggas say)
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
And we know some good good make 'em, make 'em say
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
(And we know some good good make them niggas say)
And I'm a Scorpio too
It's your dick, babygirl
I think I'm in love, love, love
I think I'm in love, love, love (Ayy, ayy)
I like a ratchet bitch
It's somethin' about when she smash with her bonnet on (Bonnet on)
Keep my dick up in her dome,
I'm fuckin' up her chromosome (Chromosome)
Like it when a young nigga hit it
She thought that I was grown (Thought that I was grown)
Open up your mouth, I'ma spit in it while I'm strokin' long
Hit it from the back like where you runnin' from?
Left the nut up on her ass, in the back like a honey bun
Hundred drums, a hundred guns, your ex play, he a dummy-dumb
Bust nut on her lip, her nigga askin' where she comin' from
Said that she a baller, I'm like, "Bitch, you know I ball too"
If she on her period, her pussy turn to ragù (Turn to ragù)
Lookin' at my chains, she got wet, bitch, that's what the bag do
I knock the pussy out of the park, now she callin' me Babe Ruth
Yeah (And we know some good dick that make the pussy say)
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
(And we know some good good make them niggas say)
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
And we know some good good make 'em, make 'em say
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
(And we know some good good make them niggas say)
And I'm a Scorpio too
It's your dick, babygirl
I think I'm in love, love, love
I think I'm in love, love, love
He know what time it is (Yeah), he better not try a bitch (Huh?)
I had the nigga sprawled 'fore I even tried the dick (On God)
Who you know gon' ride the dick? (Who?)
Take it out and swallow it? (Mmm)
Kitchen counter, coffee table, couch, all type of shit (Type of shit)
Makeup sex, won't even talk it out (Uh)
He love my Boosie verse, he wan' see what the hype about (Yeah)
Make him eat it late night like the Waffle House (Waffle House)
And purple pickle mean pull up, don't gotta type it out (Uh-uh)
Yeah, I'm wifey, but fuck him like a ratchet (Like a ratchet)
He gon' drop it in the box like a ballot (Like a ballot)
If it's gon' have me callin' bitches up and spazzin' (Brr)
Subbin' in my captions, then I gotta have it
{And we know some good dick that make the pussy say}
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
And we know some good good make 'em, make 'em say
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
And we know some good good, make 'em, make 'em say
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
And we know some good good make them niggas say
And I'm a Scorpio too
It's your dick, babygirl
I think I'm in love, love, love
I think I'm in love, love, love
