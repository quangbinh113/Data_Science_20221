Song Name: Back to the Streets (feat. Jhen√© Aiko)
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga, "Fetch"
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy around, spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets
So clean when I pull up to the scene
Big goals, and I put that on me
What's you thinkin'? What's good?
Fuck how you feel and I wish a nigga would
Had to hit the Heisman on ya homies
Steppin' in here, bad bitches only
My ex used to act like he owned me
Ain't enough just to treat me like a trophy
I had that, past that, knew I had to trash that
Bounced on his ass, turn that boy into a flashback
I'm a five-star bitch with a price tag
Gotta find me somebody that could match that
Last one got on my last nerve
Made me go change my passwords
I hit the curve with that swerve
You know I get the last word
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga, "Fetch"
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy around, spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da (yeah)
Back to the streets
Back to the streets, sent you back to yo' old hood
On hood, baby, this is for your own good
I'm a player ass bitch and you knew it
Had a good time, now I'm ready for some new dick, haha
Passed it to Saweetie, now you hit it, through with it
There it ain't really nothin' else to do with it
Yeah, you know I leveled up
I can't be stuck, I wish you luck though
Consider yourself blessed
You got to fuck with the baddest
You know that I can't be kept, no, I gotta dip out
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga, "Fetch" (yeah)
I put my new man on a leash (on a leash)
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease (ooh-ooh)
I ride around town 'til I leave (oh)
I gave the boy around, spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spit him back to the streets
Like, la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets
La-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets
Back, back to the streets
La-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, back to the streets
Put my new man on a leash
He was just a lease
Ride around town 'til I leave
