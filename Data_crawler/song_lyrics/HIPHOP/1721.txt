Bitch, I'm G to the L to the O, Big Glo(Rilla)
You can catch me out in traffic tinted, sliding with your ho (skrrt)
I ain't popping out at parties, gotta book me for a show (give me that)
He say, "Y'all be living fast," nah, pussy boy, you slow (stupid ass)
Ayy, we hopping out in red lights (go), twerking on them headlights (go)
She say she can't come outside today, that mean she scared, right? (Huh?)
I be put up in the winter, in the summer, pop out еvery night (on gang)
Bragging on that nigga top, you better hold his hеad tight (better watch him)
Anyways, life's great, pussy still good (but they knew that)
Still eating cake, wishing that a bitch would (bet they won't)
Got my foot up on they necks as a bitch should (watch me plot, let's go)
On the gang
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheating (woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (let's go)
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheating (woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (let's go)
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go)

Let's go! (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go) JT
I don't care who he fuck with, bitch, I can't be fucked with (nah)
Must be gone off Perc's if you ever thought you fucked this (what?)
Using my name for clickbait, eat my ass and my clit, wait
Bitch, I got a future, do it look like I can sit and wait?
I'm F-R-E-E, hold up, stop the beat
I'm a motherfucking City Girl, ain't shit free 'bout me (ayy)
You a fraudulent ass hoe, nigga, acting like you on, nigga
You ain't been in shit since that PPP loan, nigga (hahaha)
Anyway, pussy good, so I'm put up
Ass stroke, sitting pretty with my foot up
Y'all hoes get played, huh, not us
But if a nigga ever try, it's up
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheating (woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go) Big Latto
Let's go! (Go, go, go, go)
I'm fuck nigga free, I ain't doing no arguing (the fuck)
They ain't shit without me, all my exes like Safaree (they broke)
All my opps scared, they won't pop up at the party
Got them bitches running from me, like a episode of Maury
On the freeway, throwing ass threeways
Young bitch feel like a vet' in this C8
Call him private, I ain't text him back in three days
Can't have no fuck nigga throwing off my PH
Anyways, on the pop charts, popping shit
Two things I ain't with, sugar grits and sharing dick (on God)
Bougie, bad, and thick, 23, ain't got no kids
Pop a Plan B before I let him trap a bitch, haha
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheating (woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends
Let's go (at the red lights twerking on them headlights)
At the red lights twerking on them headlights
At the red lights twerking on them headlights
At the-, on Gang! (JT)
Haha, GloRilla
Big Latto
E-E, fuck nigga free
Why y'all hoes stressing out 'bout y'all fuck niggas cheating?
