Song Name: UP THE SMOKE (with Offset)
Young Ryan, stop playin' with me
EVRGRN with the heat (Hey)
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Pro duced by Cre8 (Hey)
Up-up the smoke, diamonds, they choke
Fuck my bro, I'm in the white Lamborghini, the Pope
Hundred racks they gon' take your soul
Glock with the three and the O
Bought a yacht, put the kids on the boat
Put a brick in the fig of the four
Got a stick, it's a Sig', it'll blow
Mix up a four, my bitch, Margiela on her toes
Dick up her soul, look what I did in the bowl
Wipe the boy nose, I go get me a bag out the glow
I do not troll, I got part of these diamonds a bowl
I smoke with my feet, my bitch is the baddest could be
Stack it and pray, go to sleep, I'm at the top of the peak
We put baguettes on top of our teeth
We put fire right under his beak
I can't lie, I got shooters that creep
She from Devry, she gon' suck me to sleep, whoa
Switch up the flow, they gon' buy this for show
Put the stick on your bitch if you hidin' for low
There's a fifth of these young niggas ready to go
Richard Mille set on my wrist, I'm the goat
Tag on your hoe, tag on your toe
Baguettes on baguettes, my neck overload
Take off his cap, leave it right with his hoe
Ain't no cap for me, the trap beat jumpin' like athletes
I get cash, ya see, Lamborghini, niggas ain't fast as me
Cookie, gas, the lean, I get the bag casually
You niggas embarassin', this Audemars, this is a masterpiece
Up-up the smoke, diamonds, they choke
Fuck my bro, I'm in the white Lamborghini, the Pope
Hundred racks they gon' take your soul
Glock with the three and the O
Bought a yacht, put the kids on the boat
Put a brick in the fig of the four
Got a stick, it's a Sig', it'll blow
Mix up a four, my bitch, Margiela on her toes
Dick up her soul, look what I did in the bowl
Wipe the boy nose, I go get me a bag out the glow
I do not troll, I got part of these diamonds a bowl
They wipe his nose if I say so
It's a green light when I say go
Ayy, what you gon' do for a bankroll?
Move like the mob, I got hittas on payroll
Twenty racks cash on the lawyer, it's case closed
Rap money turned me to a A-hole
Don't tag me when there's gun smoke
I'm tryna knock up your block, like Lego
I'm tryna knock you off, send you where nobody knows
My ice turned me anemic,
But I'm never freezin' when it's time to up the smoke
She said she diggin' my flow
I make her suck me and then suck my bro
We knock 'em down by the four
I start workin' with fire at all my shows
And I still put .30's up under all my Glicks, double D's on my sticks
Said she don't like me, ho, suck my dick
When there's beef we don't pick and choose
We got more cannons than Nick
He get put on the news or left on his dick
Tryin' me like I'm a lick
Up-up the smoke, diamonds, they choke
Fuck my bro, I'm in the white Lamborghini, the Pope
Hundred racks they gon' take your soul
Glock with the three and the O
Bought a yacht, put the kids on the boat
Put a brick in the fig of the four
Got a stick, it's a Sig', it'll blow
Mix up a four, my bitch, Margiela on her toes
Dick up her soul, look what I did in the bowl
Wipe the boy nose, I go get me a bag out the glow
I do not troll, I got part of these diamonds a bowl
