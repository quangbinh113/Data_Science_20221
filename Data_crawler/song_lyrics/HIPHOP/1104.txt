Song Name: Come Through (feat. Lil Tecca)
(Damn, Callan, you gettin' guap)
I'm like, "Baby, come through"
It's a spaceship, I got stars in the roof
Knew me in the past, and now you say I'm brand new
Feelin' like a don when I'm off the '42
Bring a couple friends with you, baby, come through
I'm like, "Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through"
Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through
I'ma bust down in Balenciagas
Shawty got shotty, she ridin' shotgun
If you freakin' in this club, baby, drop some
I ain't mean to call you bitch if you not one
You a boss bitch, so put your winning over losses
33 in Larry Bird, got green like I'm Boston
Beat it up, beat it, she told me beat it like it's boxing
I got gang ties from Modesto up to Stockton
Baby, come through
It's a spaceship, I got stars in the roof
Knew me in the past, and now you say I'm brand new
Feelin' like a don when I'm off the '42
Bring a couple friends with you, baby, come through
I'm like, "Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through"
Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through
I said, "Baby, come through, where you at?"
You don't even gotta act cool with the swag
Everybody braggin' 'bout a tag
Pull up in my lot, where that four-door at?
I can't even think 'bout you
Me and all my niggas, we don't know about you
Slide in the spot, so cool
I just hit your bitch
I'm like, "Baby, come through"
It's a spaceship, I got stars in the roof
Knew me in the past, and now you say I'm brand new
Feelin' like a don when I'm off the '42
Bring a couple friends with you, baby, come through
I'm like, "Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through"
Baby, come through, baby, come through, baby, come through
