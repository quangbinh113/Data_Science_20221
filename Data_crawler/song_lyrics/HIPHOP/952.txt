Song Name: Losses (with Young Thug)
(Wheezy outta here)
In Bentley trucks, with semis tucked, lil' hot and 'em turn the city up
We wildin', don't give any fucks, we block stars, they envy us
A broken child with stingy trust, this greatness can't be in a rush
Lil Capalot get plenty bucks, girl, this ain't love, just empty lust
Just spoil her, go shoppin', keep her ass rubbed and her titties sucked
Benjamin after Benjamin, what that money counter keep spittin' out
And that's music to my ears, and I'm dancin' with the devil
Forbes' List, I'm tryna be one of the richest, I can't settle
Rock star lifestyle, grippin' heavy metal
I put my bros on my Patek, got hood angels in my bezel
Yeah, yeah, we pay foreign cars, I got several
Shinin' to the grave, tell the undertaker, "Bust down my shovel"
I hate that summer that I lost bro
They ain't cut from my cloth, no
Nothing but bad bitches and boss hoes
Whole gang lit, that's squad goals
Jumped off the porch when I was like 13
Fell in a Rolls-Royce and it's slime green
I see the truancy, got time seen, yeah
I upgrade everything that come with my dawgs
Sometimes they love me, then hate me, they wished it all (yeah)
They wish I was broke and didn't have none of these cars (uh)
I'm so up, above your climate, I'm in the stars
I built this shit from the ground and I took it far
I caught that bitch at the counter, took care of her charge
She picked me up in a Uber, then we had went to eat
She sucked that dick, and I had asked, do she got missin' teeth
We had to party in the streets, and then they miss me
I told them, "When I come back, I'ma buy the whole street"
My homie hit the bitch, but act like he don't know a thing
That's that's mob tie, that's that mob life, yeah
I hate that summer that I lost bro
They ain't cut from my cloth, no
Nothing but bad bitches and boss hoes
Whole gang lit, that's squad goals
Jumped off the porch when I was like thirteen
Fell in a Rolls-Royce and it's slime green
I see the truancy, got time seen, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
