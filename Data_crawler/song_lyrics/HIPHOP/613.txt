Song Name: DREAMER
Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had
Your, you- you could, you'll do, you- you wants
You, you could do so, you- you'll do, you could- you, you want
You want them to do you so much you could do anything? (Yeezo Beats)
I keep trippin' away, I can't be home
I keep driftin' away, I'm close to shore
I keep you on my brain, yeah, hard to ignore
I spent most of my days, yeah, waiting for
You, waiting for you
What were you waiting for?
Waiting for
What were you waiting for?
Waiting for
You, waiting for you

What were you waiting for?
What were you wait-waiting for? (Waiting for)
What were you wait-waiting for?
I can touch your soul and tell you what you wanna hear
I'll warm you when you're cold, I keep you safe, nothing to fear
Already know, I know, I felt the pain, I shedded tears
Let me go blindfold, and I can still see that you're here (Yeah)
Phantom, drop the top, I'll fix the mirror
I got hella racks, no racketeer ('Teer)
I just made like ten million this year
This year, yeah
I keep trippin' away, I can't be home
I keep driftin' away, I'm close to shore
I keep you on my brain, yeah, hard to ignore
I spent most of my days, yeah, waiting for
You, waiting for you
What were you waiting for?
Waiting for
What were you waiting for?
Waiting for
You, waiting for you
What were you waiting for?
What were you wait-waiting for? (Waiting for)
What were you wait-waiting for?
I can touch your soul and tell you what you wanna hear
I'll warm you when you're cold, I keep you safe, nothing to fear
Already know, I know, I felt the pain, I shedded tears
And I can go blindfold, and I can still see that you're here (Yeah)
