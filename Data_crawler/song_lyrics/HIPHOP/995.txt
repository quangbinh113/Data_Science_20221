Song Name: Beat The Speaker
Uh
Look
Pop Smoke will beat the box
Pop Smoke will beat the speaker
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua
Dot up on your head for reachin'
And I'm in the Bentley truck
With a bad bitch who eat up
And I'm off the Molly geekin'
And it's 10k a feature
Pop Smoke will beat the box
Pop Smoke will beat the speaker
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua
Dot up on your head for reachin'
And I'm in the Bentley truck
With a bad bitch who eat up
And I'm off the Molly geekin'
And it's 10k a feature
AR when I walk through
Twenty-five for the walk through
Pussy boy, watch who you talk to (huh?)
Say my name with a caution
I walk in the spot, like who want it?
Gun to his head, I put jewels on 'em
Get put on your neck if your team lurkin'
Talk out your mouth and you're still barkin'
These seven fifty's got my heart racin'
Pick up a steal, like I'm Paul Payton
Clipped him in vain, that's a call waitin'
Said I ain't with the foolery, I keep a tool on me
Come out your mind, you could get hurt
Bro Trav caught a man down
Pop Smoke, I'm the man now
Pop Smoke will beat the box
Pop Smoke will beat the speaker
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua
Dot up on your head for reachin'
And I'm in the Bentley truck
With a bad bitch who eat up
And I'm off the Molly geekin'
And it's 10k a feature
Pop Smoke will beat the box
Pop Smoke will beat the speaker
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua
Dot up on your head for reachin'
And I'm in the Bentley truck
With a bad bitch who eat up
And I'm off the Molly geekin'
And it's 10k a feature
