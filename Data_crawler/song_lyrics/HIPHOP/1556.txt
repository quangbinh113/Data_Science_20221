Song Name: NO SECRET (feat. Drake)
Yeah
They tryna sink they teeth in, they act like we friends
Whole time is pretend, so whole time on defense
Good evening, I walked out the precinct
No evidence to keep me out, I'm top dog, no secret, oh
That's no secret at all
Can't nobody reach me, dawg
Can't nobody reach this far
I spill out my feelings, dawg
'Cause you'll never know this feeling, dawg
Ain't no secret at all
