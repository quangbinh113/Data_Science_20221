Song Name: Royalty (feat. Ky-Mani Marley, Stefflon Don & Vybz Kartel)
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dem soldiers yell, on these front lines
Don't know why, know why, but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dem soldiers yell, on these front lines
Don't know why, know why, but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Let me have it
Big up, yuh
Big up, yuh, big up, yuh
Like Kiara and Lanthia
Use bad man for their bread when the mortgage up
Big up, yuh
Big up, yuh, big up, yuh
Gyal, you're my Kingston
How come everybody wanna hear me on this one?
Man, what's cool is that the shit change
When you use me for the money and the cars, you're the big brains
Yeah, it's funny how shit change
Poor shorty wanna young nigga drawers, that shit stains
In a poor house, fiscane
Now I'm in the coupe with a crib, niggas Chris Paine
Never can forget all the nights it was just pain
Now I'm finna come for the throne, don't forget, mane
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dem soldiers yell, on these front lines
Don't know why, know why, but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Look up, iced out rings, now I come off
Clean from a barn, tell that gyal, she fin took off
We can't stop, we a rise, we a take off (I'm at the front door)
Tell that gyal I set trends
Me, I'm just a book upon the ends
Take me on top, pull on sumtin 'til it bends
Want a friend, bad man, ain't afraid of dem (Ain't afraid)
Wing me, I went to the end
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dem soldiers yell, on these front lines
Don't know why, know why, but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Majesty Haile Selassie so we royal
Triple X crew, so we loyal
Big body, fat pussy, broad gyal
Come here, back it up gyal, buss a whine, mhm
Bin no need a ten, I need a nine, mhm
Miami girl, Caribbean whine
Y'all di say y'all real body broke a
Young kisser, you a bad muhfucka
Keep Miami, ooh, I dun see why we can't
Work the yammi while I keep running
Man grimy, crimy
Can't style me, pile me
Man Triple X to Tentacion
Pull up on de mans, ah like taxi man
Na spray cologne, we spray hot metal
Real bad man like Sandokan
Real hut girl, bad man gropin'
Anyway we walk de street, go van
No fear or tear, no Alice, no Peter Pan
Versace style, Louis V pattern
We strike the street hard no fee fo' plan
Kick your fam, we be half a Gee ya lang
We bound to get goin' no need no man
We like facade, taxi read a man
With bars I work with a breeder and
Big city, black man feeding
Smoke high grade, I'm fly like pigeon
Real bad man we nah haffi have image
School like scrimmage an' I'll finish
Fuck them we can nah squeeze or lick it
Sharp shooter like big lip dickin'
Have to live twice, to the tings dat did it
TG tell 'em a-why I ya'll wicked
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dem soldiers yell, on these front lines
Don't know why, know why, but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
