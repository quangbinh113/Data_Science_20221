Song Name: I Think I Luv Her (feat. YG)
(Cash Money AP)
(Hitmaka)
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Caught up in crazy girls with my side chick
Playing so stupid like that's not my bitch
Two tone on my wrist look like I'm so rich
Your pockets so dry look like a cactus
She got a ass-ass-ass spending my last, wait
I need the cash-cash, take it out the ATM
Call my business manager, she need to change my pin
Gave it to a little baddie, now she going ham
Wet pack on me
Racks get lonely
Niggas wanna see my baguettes, they know they glow
Brand new Lambo
Pink Flamingo
Hop inside that bitch, I hit the floor and then I'm gone
Wait
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Like I'm mopping it
She be wet and she be sticky, and she be topping it
Bitch we really do this fly shit, so I'm popping it
I gave baby girl free game, that's a scholarship
If I whip the dick out right now, is you driving it?
Aye all they life niggas throwing shade
Bust down my Cartier frames
Oh my God, I'm ashamed
Ay, I make a pretty bitch tatt my name
Her friends like, "Oh my God, you're insane"
(You're insane, bitch)
It go vroom vroom in a Lambo (In a Lambo)
I do my two step, my diamonds dance though (My diamonds dance hoe)
Baby how you in the club with some shell toes?
Upgrade you to some Prada pumps, hello
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Ooh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Oh, she walking like a lick when she wobble it
Think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Ooh, I'm walking with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two toned on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
