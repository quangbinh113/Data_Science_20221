Song Name: This Ain't That
Better listen closely, ayy, shoot a pussy nigga acting nosy
Yeah, t's just Big 14 and Lil Mosey, yeah
Fuck that ho, you treat her like a trophy, huh
Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit
Nigga this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
No legit, you's a bitch, nigga, this ain't that for real

Shoot him with this choppa make his body dance, uh
Choppa get to bussin', do the runnin' man, uh
Would of threw a party, I ain't got no friends, uh
All my niggas brothers and that's to the end, uh
Would of used a Glock but I used the F&N
Shooting .223's, you a dead man, uh
Typical to shoot, at your head man
Where the fuck you 'posed to keep a head band
Like you been broke, but we balling the way

Lemme eat that kitty, baby hello
Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit
Nigga this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
I'm with 14, we gon' fucking smoke an OG
This big loud, it's some gas, got me choking
Walking through my city, shaking bullets off me
Know my riches cause these bitches always flexin'
You ain't with us as I can tell, bougie hot as hell
Thinking about buying a well and a new crib
For my momma, uh always pull up with some drums
But nigga I'm riding with gunners (Boom)
I'm just wondering what Kari would do
Beatin' his case, so I got him a Juul
Niggas was slatt down, we ain't doing no acting
Slide down 'less you have it, we still causing havoc
We ride with the gang, no I don't wanna be friends
I turn a five to a ten, money, I'm throwing a band
Backwoods, I'm smoking the gas, I'm finna fuck her and pass
Skrrt skrrt I hop in the wraith
When I'm running from 12 and I'm doing the dash
Ooh, dripping like water
And she wanna fuck with money up on her
Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit
Nigga this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
