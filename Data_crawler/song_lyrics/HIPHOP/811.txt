Song Name: Rich Nigga Problems
'Bout 12 bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
But when that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
All your friends hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous
Got a mink doormat that say, "Nigga, we made it"
Got all white neighbors and most of 'em racist
They put your name and faces when you goin' in places
The black ain't enough, you just don't wanna be famous
Real talk, real rap, look, I can't deny shit
Couldn't afford shit, but always was attracted to fly shit
Guess that's why I buy, won't invest or capitalize
But expectin' to die rich, just a rich nigga mindset
That's why I'm packin' up my shit, like I'm back at the mom's crib
Like I'm back on my grind like, it's a nine-to-five shift
'Cause nothin' was handed to me, uh, go in and hand it to me
Like I'm Puffy in '96, (gimme the loot, gimme the loot!)
Let's hope that she really for me, most hoes couldn't handle me
I'm postponin' a family, work hard so they know what I stand for
Just have 'em to Grammy me? Damn, have 'em Grammy me?
Damn, just don't wanna be famous
'Bout 12 bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
You don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
Your friends like hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous
Uh, look at me, get what you see, envision me
Brazen chains, is he Pusha T or Mr. T?
Know who could smoke, no niggas please, no liquor please
A different me, I'm in this bitch and I'm sippin' tea
Uh, but never spill the tea, most of you niggas sick of me
What would she do to get to me? Get off the tip of the dick of me, please
Another victory, be flawless like the skin on me, please
Don't compare him and me, you offendin' me
This ain't a diss and we ain't enemies
They concerned with breakin' hits, I'm more concerned with makin' history
Loudest nigga in the room the weakest
Them quiet dudes just probably need better speakers
This ain't a modest way of livin', I ain't hungry
Just did a demolition to my kitchen, it was ugly
Cash rules everything around me, get the money funny
How they got 2020 vision but don't see a nigga vision 'til 2020? Fuck
Wow (uh)
'Bout 12 bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
You don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
Your friends like hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous
Woo, this some bullshit

Yeah
Three, three
Three, two, one, cut
