Song Name: Paris to Tokyo
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes (SB on the track)
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer, let's fly (uh)
Walk in the store, get whatever you want (whatever)
That's my bitch (oh, yeah)
Paris, Tokyo, London (uh), I took her on all of my trips (all)
I try to show you what's real (yeah)
You ain't like them other hoes I hit (oh, no)
I introduce you to real
Baby, ain't nobody else like this (no, no)
Off of the liquor, I reminisce
Hennessy up in my system (I'm waitin')
Bae, I'm a player, I fuck up a lot
But it ain't the same when I'm with them (you)
Baby, you different, uh, or maybe I'm trippin' (for real)
If I lost it all tomorrow, tell me (tell)
Would you still be with me? (Woah-oh, huh)
Whenever I see her, she comin' horny (uh)
Everybody know I'm in love with shorty
I ain't none of them niggas that come before me
She was with me back when I was young and corny
If I tell her I need her, she comin' for me
When she stare at it, it feel like there's somethin' on me
Made me feel like these bitches got nothin' for me
She don't want me to have it (nah, have it)
She'll hold mine (uh, baow)
If we ever get pulled over with the chop'
She takin' the charge and the whole nine
I don't really know why, I met her in '09
I was lit, she was curvin' the whole time
They was thinkin' she payin' me no mind
But I knew I would have her in no time (woo)
Livin' reckless, huh (livin' reckless)
In the crib drippin' and walkin' 'round naked
We order a Pi√±a colada for breakfast (woo, woo)
And we sexin', huh (we sexin')
No Instagram, no textin'
Turn off the light and I fuck her to Netflix (woo)
Walk in the store, get whatever you want (whatever, uh)
That's my bitch (oh yeah, uh)
Paris, Tokyo, London (uh), I took her on all of my trips (all)
I try to show you what's real (yeah)
You ain't like them other hoes out here (oh, no)
I introduce you to real
Baby, ain't nobody else like this (no, no)
Off of the liquor, I reminisce
Hennessy up in my system (I'm waitin')
Bae, I'm a player, I fuck up a lot
But it ain't the same when I'm with them (you)
Baby, you different, uh, or maybe I'm trippin' (for real)
If I lost it all tomorrow tell me
Would you still be with me? (No-no)
Come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer, let's fly
Up, up here we go, go
