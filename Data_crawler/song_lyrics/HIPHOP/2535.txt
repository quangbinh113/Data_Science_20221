Song Name: Outside Lookin In
Roll up or miss you I can't do both
Before my pockets empty rather my heart be the one broke
Ain't no rules up in this shit make sure you make your own
Money keep coming in it don't mean none if I don't own none
Run up again and again where I'm from them youngins grown ups
Outside lookin in whole lotta sins but I ain't showing none
At all
For better for worse or don't get involved
Stay on alert don't false an alarm
Gonna pay what its worth a leg and an arm
I was putting you first it was causin' me harm
Now I lay in this syrup it cost me a charm
Off some I'm off some
If I don't see you I'm on some
Want some they want some
Don't wrong me I'm the wrong one
I got overlooked when I was down see me now I'm going up
Fuck 'bout being topic of the town long
As this bread ain't slowin up
I don't want none but hundreds on the ground
Hundred percent they know wassup
Can't say I ain't tired of staying down
But I'm in this shit for the long run
Ain't ever say you gotta stay around you could get out the way
I went alone when I was child you know I'm not the same
These niggas hoes they found a way out and then go block the lane
I called up the whole team gave it out soon as I got the game
I could've did more for you
But you lost me dealing with all that lame shit
Say what you want wont change shit
I don't even talk that language
Roll up or miss you I can't do both
Before my pockets empty rather my heart be the one broke
Ain't no rules up in this shit make sure you make your own
Money keep coming in it don't mean none if I don't own none
Run up again and again where I'm from them youngins grown ups
Outside lookin in whole lotta sins but I ain't showing none
At all
For better for worse or don't get involved
Stay on alert don't false an alarm
Gonna pay what its worth a leg and an arm
I was putting you first it was causin' me harm
Now I lay in this syrup it cost me a charm
