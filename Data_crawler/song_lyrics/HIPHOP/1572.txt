Song Name: Dead Shot (with Lil Uzi Vert)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go (let's go)
Shootout with a vest, but that boy, he still caught a headshot (oh-oh)
Bro can shoot from down the street, his nickname, yeah, is "Dead Shot" (oh-oh)
Bro just chased the opp until his legs stop
I just fucked this thot and I just hit her with that leg lock, yeah
My chest hurt when I be talkin' 'cause I'm smokin' dead opps
He think he a shotta, hit his top and take his dreads off
And I got these Perkies in my pocket like I'm tryna get these meds off
Me and Lil Uzi stackin' up so much guap, we'll pay the feds off
Every time I do somethin' right, they try to say I'm dead wrong
I could fuck your lil' bitch in my whip, I treat it like my bedroom
Pulled up in a coupe, no, I didn't have no headroom
My niggas about that murder gang, I call it red room
She let me hit in the car, you know that backseat got some leg room
I just took half a pill from Pluto, and I went to Neptune
When I'm lackin' confidence, my diamonds comin' to the rescue
Got shooters that watch my back, every time I sneeze, they be like, "Bless you" (bow)
Put a check right on your head, no reason for me just to check you
Got cash on me like XO, I don't know what no lil' check do
And he could sneeze up on his song, but I still would not bless you
Walkin' on this beat and I ain't even got no dress shoes
The way that your girl be toppin' me off, I could tell she don't respect you
Fuckin' her like a dog, she at my house, she watch my pets too
Just got a brand new uzi, I'm with Uzi and we got TECs too
Got the water on my neck and I could easily get you wet too (let's go)
Shootout with a vest, but that boy, he still caught a headshot (oh-oh)
Bro can shoot from down the street, his nickname, yeah, is "Dead Shot" (oh-oh)
Bro just chased the opp until his legs stop
I just fucked this thot and I just hit her with that leg lock, yeah
My chest hurt when I be talkin' 'cause I'm smokin' dead opps
He think he a shotta, hit his top and take his dreads off
And I got these Perkies in my pocket like I'm tryna get these meds off
Me and Lil Uzi stackin' up so much guap, we'll pay the-
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up, stack it up
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up, stack it
Stackin' up this fuckin' paper, to get to the top, you gon' need elevator
If you get to the top, yeah, come with the fade
If you get to the top, yeah, come with some haters
I was not good in school, but I'm stackin' the paper
Low land, 1600 shit
Yeah, she give me brain, that's a scholarship
She don't know my name, but she love this dick
I'm too fuckin' rich, I might pop my shit
Every time I pop my collar, yeah, it complement the fit
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Stepped on my Nikes, I'm gettin' a check
Havin' this money is really a flex, 1600 to the Rex', yeah
I know she fuckin' with all of the rappers
But long as you tell me she love me the best
There ain't no contest, I'm gettin' my content
I love when she on it, she givin' me sex
Always use condoms, got Fendi pajamas
Treat hoes like my problems, I put 'em to bed
I'm gettin' moody, I know she too bougie
She don't use a manual when she go to kitch'
I gotta get all my habits in check
Had to go on the jet, couldn't walk up the steps
Go to the trap, I feel used to the Tes'
I got birdies that fly far away from the nest (yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
Shootout with a vest, but that boy he still caught a headshot (oh-oh)
Bro can shoot from down the street, his nickname, yeah, is "Dead Shot" (oh-oh)
Bro just chased the opp until his legs stop (what, what)
I just fucked this thot and I just hit her with that leg lock, yeah
