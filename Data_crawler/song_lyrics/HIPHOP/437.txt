Song Name: All For Me
Ayo Bans, what you cookin'?
Yeah, I see you been on my mind today
I'm thinkin' about rubbin' down on your spine today
Yeah, I love you' bitch, you into finer things
I'm sittin' back, Cartier bitch, I'm in designer frames
And ain't no tryna play me, and ain't no acting shady
'Cause you're my fucking baby' yeah
It's like we on a plane, see
We up, up, and away, yeah, yeah
Tell me, would you ride for me?
Love in murder bae, would you die for me? (Die for me)
Roll down the window in back, slide for me (Me)
Baby, your love is just all for me
All for me, all for me
Baby, your love is just all for me
All for me, all for me
Baby, your love is just all for me
Shawty, go get that money and bring it back to me
And you been on my mind, girl you like a drug to me
I relapse every time, I'm like, "Fuck it, IOD"
Feels like you do it on purpose
Wanna see the kid deceased (Wanna see)
And she tired of lames, I put her on some game (Game)
Don't wan't roses, she want sexes out the shower today
I swear we something like a Bentley couple
Drop-top Mulsanne, look how the leather touch you
Tell me, would you ride for me?
Love in murder bae, would you die for me? (Die for me)
Roll down the window in back, slide for me
Baby, your love is just all for me
All for me, all for me
Baby, your love is just all for me
All for me, all for me
Baby, your love is just all for me, all for me
Uh, 'cause I-I, I like to talk about love, and it's always on my mind
U'm, I'm always, oh
I've really stopped looking for someone, unfortunately
Because, currently, where my mind is, it's just like
I don't wanna say I've given up but
I've just seen everybody make me promises
And make me promises on promises and never really fulfil, like
I was always looking for a caretaker
Looking for someone that would protect me, take initiative for me
And just be the greatest person they could, for me
And, and that may be selfish, I don't know
But, it, that's just me being honest
And every time I've kinda let myself be lead on by someone
They either deceive me or just treat me really, really, really bad
And I'm, I'm a very genuine person, and I'm far too emotional
And I care too much
And I've, I've definitely cared too much in situations
And been fucked over, been fucked over, been fucked over...
