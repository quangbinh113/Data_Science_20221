Song Name: CASH COW
Bag, she don't want a bag, yeah, I got M's in it, man (M's in it, man)
Cash out like a Cashapp, I put cash in her hand (Cash in her hand)
Cop a foreign rim with no visa, put a shark on land (Shark on land)
Pour codeine out of freezer, feelin' like a Xan (Feelin' like a Xan)
I know you want you some bands (Bands)
I'm havin' millions of fans (I'm havin' millions of fans)
Yo girl wanna cool is a fan yeah
Tan on a beach, get a tan, yeah
Broke, I can't hear what you sayin' (Sayin')
Spend the whole block I ain't playin'
We hunt the block like a bloodhound
When they shot up, it's a man down
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Wow
Nigga touch money like cash cow
Racks make a pocket poke out
Got a Elliot stunt with a rose crown
Top floor talking from the mountop
Key lime put it in the mouth
Fine, she makin' me aroused
Play with pussy I eat it Mr.Chow
Glock hold 30 whole rounds
Let me water my chains, buss down
Copped my mezzi bust down
I remember I couldn't afford a pound
Money on me got 'em lookin' 'round
These hits got me in and out of town
My fits like a drip I never drown (my fits)
Hot shit, need to wipe a nigga down
Bag, she don't want a bag, yeah, I got M's in it, man (M's in it, man)
Cash out like a Cashapp, I put cash in her hand (Cash in her hand)
Cop a foreign rim with no visa, put a shark on land (Shark on land)
Pour codeine out of freezer, feelin' like a Xan (Feelin' like a Xan)
I know you want you some bands (Bands)
I'm havin' millions of fans (I'm havin' millions of fans)
You girl with a coupe is the fame, yeah
Tnn on a beach, get a tan, yeah
Broke, I can't hear what you sayin' (Sayin')
Spend the whole block I ain't playin'
We hunt the block like a bloodhound
When they shot up, it's a man down
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Wow
Came in the game my own style
Top shelf, top floor pent
I bought my bitch a Chanel blouse
Off-White stunt, good kicks
Committed to the game, I said my vows
1.7 what I paid for the house
Remember I was sellin' 0.7's out the house
And I ain't livin' for the clout
Gun smoke blew, got lotta clouds
Heard you got a new B pouch
My bracelet's at least a hunnid thou
I basically made it out the South
And we could wait it patently, never gotta pout
Now I get to spend and it never runnin' out
That's a Fendi, and I ain't gotta doubt
Bag, she don't want a bag, yeah, I got M's in it, man (M's in it, man)
Cash out like a Cashapp, I put cash in her hand (Cash in her hand)
Cop a foreign rim with no visa, put a shark on land (Shark on land)
Pour codeine out of freezer, feelin' like a Xan (Feelin' like a Xan)
I know you want you some bands (Bands)
I'm havin' millions of fans (I'm havin' millions of fans)
You girl with a coupe is the fame, yeah
Tan on a beach, get a tan, yeah
Broke, I can't hear what you sayin' (Sayin')
Spend the whole block I ain't playin'
We hunt the block like a bloodhound
When they shot up, it's a man down
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Need to take care like cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
