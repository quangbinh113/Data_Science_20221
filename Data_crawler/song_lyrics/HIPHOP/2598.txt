Song Name: In My Pockets
I'mYeah uh
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Shhhh shhh shh nay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
See y'all I'm coming in
It's tradition that i take this shit
Uh yeah cut off uhm this shit is crazy
A nice day in the city so I witnessed for real
The sun is out I closed the deal
Wanna think about these dudes don't get am after now
Nigga get off your ass there's a life to live
A push in the line show desire
And I wanna fuck away using a condom
Imma fresh ass nigga wanna check on him
I like girls from Northland but I'm from a Frisco man
Hold on when you had a chance you blew it up don't talk no more please
Fucking with them Lord nigga you must be stu
Bitches how we do it I've been following lines switch
I'm a boss and imma boss up daily
Niggas charging over money man it's getting shady
I roll up a worldwide chill on my balcony
Nigga is horny and I get on nigga charging him
Drop top vehicles and pretty ass woman
John where you been I've been following lines switch
I've been up and around the world
Making money in my pocket if you wanna make something not a chance
Making money in my pocket making money in my pocket
Live your life every day nigga fuck what they say
Making money in my pocket, making money in my pocket
I've been all around the world nigga getting to a bad
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my pocket
G buddies, g buddies, fitfies
Vest with no sleeves, move on
Keeping it pisce
Twenty peas in these calls with no jean
I'm taping of the black woman stepping out at night with my White sneakers at night
Everything clean like the house of a judge keep up everything like I'm a dark blue cat
Pull up in the badass bitch never touch
Niggas charging shame
I'm on a different mode got her bent over hmmm
Baby bend down so I'm pulling her over hmmm
Let's take a nice walk hmmm
Baby like that's a nice watch hmm
I'm feeling good today I fuck the random girl y'all
Money's in the walls in the flow s like war Lord's scar lords but I'm nervous
Everything legit
I ain't tripping on the Rolex
I've been all around the world nigga getting too bad
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my pocket
If you wanna make something then you gotta take a chance
I got money in my pocket I got money in my pocket
Living life all day don't care what the fuck they say
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my pocket
I've been all around the world getting too bad
I got money in my pocket I got money in my pocket
G buddies, fifties
Bitches vest with no sleeves
Move on keeping it pische
Twenty cars in the deep blue jeans
