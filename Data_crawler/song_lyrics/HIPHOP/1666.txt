Song Name: Real Spill
(Only love could bring us)
(Bring us to this better plane)
I know that I'm beneficial
I can't show no feelings
Bentley windows tinted
Nowadays ain't no time for me to kick it
Business too intensive
They gone say that I been actin' different
I'm beyond, they mental
I moved on from slanging drugs and pistols
Can't be thinking simple
Tighten up my circle
Someone in my camp been leaking info
The Maybach triple black, the shit relaxing
Feel like I'm in a limo
I pull through the hood 2 let them see
I let down all the windows
I know I'm the motivation
They see me they see a hero
Lot of niggas rich, but it hit different
When you come from zero
They know I bang C's
But everyday I need a different B roll
Super superstitious
Ask my niggas, I still pick up pennies
You can't give attention to these bitches
When your name get mentioned
If i don't kill him, he gone be in critical condition
When I'm finished with him
Some shit just can't faze you when you been that nigga
Brodie died, that shit had me all sentimental
Cuz got life in jail
I pray to God they overturn his sentence
I got too much money for my mom to work a job
I know she proud now
Sensei bitches when they see me
They gone bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got the blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got sliding glass doors
Don't got no doorknobs
I'm in charge, I'm always gone go hard
You just do your part, and no matter what
Know if you get up, then you lose your spot
You can say whatever
But if I change its for the better
That shit was painful, but I ain't let up
I left a stain in the ghetto
Been inside the mix since a lil jit
Got my name from the ghetto, but I'm bigger now
I can go to dinner with Corey Gamble and Miss Jenner now
Couple hundred on the grand up on the 'Gram gefore it went in style
They'll call me like take it down
I been the one, bossed up
I don't gotta do it, but I'ma get her done
I man up and handle my problems
When I can easily run
Easy come, easy go
Sell it all get some more
We done made it to another year
I'm swapping out my cars again
Everything is the latest
Can't complain, 'cause I made it
Who am I gone judge?
I don't never hold nuts
I don't never hold grudge
Went to Miami for a concert
Hit Chanel store for my baby
I spend 300 on a Mercedes
If I keep goin, I'll be the greatest
I bust out crying, and I wasn't sad
It's just a little feeling you get when you make it
I done tried tried tried and tried again
I cant even fake it
I got too much money for my mom to work a job
I know she proud now
Sensei bitches when they see me
They gone bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got the blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got sliding glass doors
Don't got no doorknobs
Im in charge, I'm always gone go hard
You just do your part and no matter what
Know if you get up, then you lose your spot
(Only one of us who's gonna walk away)
(Here in the deep below)

(That only darkness really knows)
