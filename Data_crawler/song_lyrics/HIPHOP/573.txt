Song Name: CITY OF ANGELS
I sold my soul to the devil for designer
They said, "Go to hell" but I told 'em I don't wanna
If you know me well, then you know that I ain't goin'
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna die young
The city of angels where I have my fun
Don't wanna die young
When I'm gone, remember all I've done, 'one
We've had our fun, 'un
But now I'm done, 'one
'Cause you crazy, yeah, I can't take it (No)
Just wanted to see you naked
Heard time like money, can't waste it
What's the price of fame? 'Cause I can taste it
So I'm chasin' (Yeah), and I'm facin'
A little Hennessy, it might be good for me
I sold my soul to the devil for designer
They said, "Go to hell" but I told 'em I don't wanna
If you know me well, then you know that I ain't goin'
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna die young
The city of angels where I have my fun
Don't wanna die young
When I'm gone, remember all I've done, 'one
