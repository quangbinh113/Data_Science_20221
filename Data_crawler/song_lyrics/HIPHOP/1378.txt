Song Name: locked out
Shame on you (on you!)
Letting me fall down
I can't lose (can't lose)
You're not with me now
Drowning, midnight skies
I didn't bring you here to cry (bring you here to cry)
No (woah-ooh)
Was it all a lie? (Was it all a lie?) (Yeah, yeah)
Or am I trippin', just in my head?
Should I just try to stay right here with you? (Here with you)
Oh, oh-oh
Or is that stupid 'cause love is dead?
I should just get up and run away from you
Ah-ah, ah
I get locked out, of your love again, oh, wow
We fucked it up again, somehow
Oh, I get locked out, oh, I get locked out
I really loved you, wow
I fuckin' hate you now
Oh, I get locked out, oh, I get locked
I'm so over this right now
Girl, I'll say when I'm not down
Don't wanna hear that you've been beamin'
'Cause I've been out here fighting demons
Really tryna hide what I'm goin' through
Insta' pics that I like of you
Really wanna say that I'm missin' you
'Cause I've been out here failing too
I'm not over you right now
Got a lot to say if you came 'round
I wanna try this again (oh-oh, oh)
Or am I trippin', just in my head?
Should I just try to stay right here with you? (Here with you)
Oh, oh-oh
Or is that stupid 'cause love is dead?
I should just get up and run away from you
Ah-ah, ah
I get locked out, of your love again, oh, wow (oh, wow)
We fucked it up again, somehow (somehow)
Oh, I get locked out (yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, I get locked out
Oh, why you gotta know the answers, baby?
There's only one thing I know, it's you (it's you)
Both your arms around me when it's late, ah-ah, ah
Then I get locked out (locked out), of your love again, oh, wow (oh, wow)
We fucked it up again, somehow (somehow)
Oh, I get locked out (yeah), oh, I get locked out
I really loved you, wow
I fuckin' hate you now (you now)
Oh, I get locked out, oh, I get locked
