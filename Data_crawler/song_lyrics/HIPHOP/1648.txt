Song Name: To The Bone (feat. YoungBoy Never Broke Again)
(Sluzyyy chasin' the bag)
(I love you, Atake)
No, I'm not alone 'cause I came with the fire
I'm still gon' put it on and my bitch match my vibe (woo)
The way the load drop, she might think it's out the sky (drop)
I'm standin' on business and she standin' on mine (su, su)
This lil' bitch right here so bad to the bone (she bad)
I can't wait to get her ass to come home (come home)
Wake up, both of us gotta get bags in the morn' (wake up)
Sneak and link, no, we can't answer the phone (link up)
Peep out the window, think somebody lookin'
We hot like some shit that came out of an oven (shh)
Innocent bitch that amounted to nothin'
Take a bitch then I turn it to somethin' (woo, woo)
I must be a plug, like a nigga, I front it
Lil' bitch, she bad, she workin' at Onyx (work)
I gave her a sack full of money
She brought that shit back and it came with something (double)
Back to back, demons runnin'
The lil' bitty 392, it ain't nothin' (vroom)
She fuck with a boss, she upgraded from her last nigga, said he wasn't nothin' (damn)
Her nigga ain't seen no money
Fresh out the trap, we steppin' and gunnin'
Meet me at Toka, meet me at Boar, nigga want smoke or beef, we comin' (go)
Look at these big boy toys, they gorgeous, all these gorgeous girls want it
I be ignorin' 'em, they be ignorin' me, I be ignorin' 'em, sike, we fuckin'
Fuck your mans, no, she can't answer the phone (brr)
She outside, she gettin' that bag on her own (she gone, su)
No, I'm not alone 'cause I came with the fire
I'm still gon' put it on and my bitch match my vibe (woo)
The way the load drop, she might think it's out the sky (drop)
I'm standin' on business and she standin' on mine (su, su)
This lil' bitch right here so bad to the bone (she bad)
I can't wait to get her ass to come home (come home)
Wake up, both of us gotta get bags in the morn' (wake up)
Sneak and link, no, we can't answer the phone (link up)
Custom beads, how much bread? Cash overload
Wherever we stop, we just hurry and cop, I be spendin' that shit on a coat (on a coat)
Aim for the throat (yeah)
Shorty bad to the bone, plan on drainin' me slow and I know (and I know)
She know she can't get a young nigga from out of the door
That one, I ain't workin' no more
She look Vietnamese, Chinese
Bitch stay with some Benz keys (woah)
You been okay, you got me
But still, nah, don't you try me
I'm ruthless and like breakin' all the rules and shorty bad like that
Fatigue attack, but know that I'm a mack, bitch, I'm a Cadillac (Cadillac)
Left a money trail, she on her own
She flash, I block her from my phone
Slime her out, she say I'm wrong
Cutthroat all way to my bone
Baddie gon' lead me astray, put an AP on top both our arms
Bitch bad, I'm all inside her home, I'm strapped up, I ain't alone
My image, she feel it, fuck with her, she want it, I get it, I'm takin' her out of the city
Got' ball up in it, make sure that her fingers be glistenin'
Them diamonds, I'm floodin' her with it
Whenever I hit it, she love it, she love me, she tell me, "YoungBoy, you know you the sickest"
Fuckin' on that ass, out on daydate, I cum and I call that leavin' my riches
I'm standin' on business, uh
No, I'm not alone 'cause I came with the fire
I'm still gon' put it on and my bitch match my vibe (woo)
The way the load drop, she might think it's out the sky (drop)
I'm standin' on business and she standin' on mine (su, su)
This lil' bitch right here so bad to the bone (she bad)
I can't wait to get her ass to come home (come home)
Wake up, both of us gotta get bags in the morn' (wake up)
Sneak and link, no, we can't answer the phone (link up)
Freaky, sneaky, all these bitches tryna get hit
Make a hoe wet lookin' at diamonds on my neck and on my wrist
Niggas ain't bullshittin', walked through the club with a F&N in this bitch
Treat it like Ray J (How?)
She wanna talk to the kid, make one wish
I'ma get fried rice
Shrooms and syrup, I'm tryna get high tonight
Servin' them pies, white
Diamonds start dancin' as soon as they hittin' the light
Jesus piece, Christ (Christ)
With your geek light (geek)
Do you like Miley Cyrus? (Miley)
Or you like Virgil White? (White)
I'm in my zone, I'm bad to the bone, I won't make it home tonight (No)
I made the check my wife (check)
And she gon' get me right (right)
I'm havin' the urge to purge and splurge, it's scary like poltergeist (scary)
Told that bitch to tell her nigga we ain't nothin' alike (bitch)
I done been jumpin' off porches, ain't talkin' Adidas, I earned my stripes (earned 'em)
Fuck with the gang and ride with the family whether they wrong or right (family)
You want a cash transaction? No, we can't Visa swipe (swipe)
Can't put my trust in security, I keep my pipe to protect my life, I know my rights (brrt)
No, I'm not alone 'cause I came with the fire
I'm still gon' put it on and my bitch match my vibe (woo)
The way the load drop, she might think it's out the sky (drop)
I'm standin' on business and she standin' on mine (su, su)
This lil' bitch right here so bad to the bone (she bad)
I can't wait to get her ass to come home (come home)
Wake up, both of us gotta get bags in the morn' (wake up)
Sneak and link, no, we can't answer the phone (link up)
