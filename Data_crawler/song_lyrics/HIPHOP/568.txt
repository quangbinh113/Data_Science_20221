Song Name: Righteous
I will (Will)
I will (I will)
I will
Uh (Uh)
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety, the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing, wheezing, bleeding
High, I'm an anxious soul
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I'll know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety, the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah, uh)
I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety, the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)
I will see
