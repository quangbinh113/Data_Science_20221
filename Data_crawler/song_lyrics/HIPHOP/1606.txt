Song Name: issues
I've been duckin' my friends
I've been stuck on my ends
Memories about people all in my head
First come to mind is my mama buyin' me Jordans
Are we really made equal?
'Cause everybody got plans
I can't go ghost, I face demons
Don't let it defeat you, all in my hands
I know it's hard for you to come out that trance
I look myself in the mirror when I can
Let's speak the truth, tell me in pieces
I know it's you, I know just what you do
I knew since we first got evicted out our roof
My new since rehab, I was six, tryna see you
How could I resent you?
Demons can test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we've been through
Don't let the wolves come get you
Please don't let them come get you
How could I resent you?
Demons can test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we've been through
Don't let the wolves come get you
Please don't let them come get you
Run away from home, run away from home
When the night's gone, when the night's gone
Run away from home, run away from home-ome-ome-ome-ome
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why it all seems to be convinced?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all question my exit?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all livin' on the fence?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why I'm sleepin' on it?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why it get me so upset?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why they want me dead?
Why you listen to the demons in your head?
Why do we play victim? Good times are ahead
Attention, this is my life sentence, huh, huh
You're committed, huh, defensive 'bout your vision, huh, huh
Don't you get offended, huh
When the darkness hits, I'll show you all that I'm not kiddin', huh
Grow a tree, plant the seed, let it breathe
My sister Ree-Ree only see me on the screen
I know she needs me, I can't help but feel T
How could I resent you?
Demons can test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we've been through
Don't let the wolves come get you
Please don't let them come get you
How could I resent you?
Demons can test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we've been through
Don't let the wolves come get you
Please don't let them come get you
