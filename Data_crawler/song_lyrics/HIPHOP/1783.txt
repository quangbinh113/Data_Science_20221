P-P-Pree them and creep up (creep up)
We was in the yard with the hammer fillin' the ladder (ladder)
Shells in my palm like peanuts
Put it on sprays it's easier (brrr)
When the flake did a lock on the window seal
Had to put it in the freezer (freezer)
Playin' with the sprayer, that ain't no regular, I'm pullin' the lever
Me and bro plannin' the works at brunch
And I'm eatin' this Chicken Caesar (Caesar)
Opps would've handed the shots
Pull up at the chicken shop like Amelia
'Member when- 'member when me and broski try catch it
When we got caught, we caught amnesia
Rustlin' through these .9m laces (laces)
When it's off safe, I'm the safest (yes)
We don't want legs, just face it
Put him on his back gotta face it (look)
With this G- with this- with this G19, I'm grateful (yeah)
Let it go, that's goodness gracious (bap)
Paid for the body, do it like Rollie
Put him in the box with the papers (huh)
T-Tap that once, hear the showerin' noise (bap)
Should've only got bine, but he got the knife as well
He's spoilt (aah)
Should've only got shoes, but she got the bag as well
She's spoilt (spoilt)
I was good with the scorps, but I got the .9 as well
I'm spoilt
Tap that once, hear the showerin' noise (bap, bap)
Should've only got bine, but he got the knife as well
He's spoilt (aah)
Should've only got shoes, but she got the bag as well
She's spoilt (spoilt)
I was good with the scorps, but I got the .9 as well
I'm spoilt
She got 500K on the Gram (yeah)
I still bring her to the block with the gang (gang)
Give him the stick, I'm calm with assist
I ain't gotta ask, "Who got that man?" (Who got killed?)
I ain't gotta queue in Louis
I pick and pick, walk me to the car with my bags (nyoom)
Pattern anywhere I go
Oii bro, walk me to the car with the mash (bow)
Six in this dirty spinner (spinner)
Rap boy still servin' dinner (yeah)
Limo tint, that's front and back
And that's cah I swerve with drillers (nyoom)
Two, not one, that's a madness
'Member when I didn't have gloves? Still grabbed it
'Member when I stopped that bike?
Watch broski jump off, burn that fabric (bap, bap)
.9mm's with the four bells
I got brick shots, I got tour sales (yeah)
Tape that road up, pray I don't see a ring doorbell (don't)
Hoodie up, let it recoil
Gang love the farmer one, it's loyal
Two in a .12, snap that, give him a third, he's spoilt (hunnh)
T-Tap that once, hear the showerin' noise (bap)
Should've only got bine, but he got the knife as well
He's spoilt (aah)
Should've only got shoes, but she got the bag as well
She's spoilt (spoilt)
I was good with the scorps, but I got the .9 as well
I'm spoilt (mm-mm)
Tap that once, hear the showerin' noise (bap, bap)
Should've only got bine, but he got the knife as well
He's spoilt (huh)
Should've only got shoes, but she got the bag as well
She's spoilt (Spoilt)
I was good with the scorps, but I got the .9 as well
I'm spoilt
