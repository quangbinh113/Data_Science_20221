Song Name: Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty b-tch
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Your scheming don't affect me
I'm fresh Im fly, Im so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't hand cuff you can get the whole damn crew
Get in my Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me
She been fiending since she let me
I'm the coolest sh-t especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my sm-sm-smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley
Color vanilla and cherry Andretti on Pirelli make a movie out the getty
Wear my ring and my confetti and I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
Im so fly Im so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu and machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
Platinum band platinum bezzie
Make a straight girl out of lezzie
Machine, mac, dessi keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stuntin
My roof look like it's duckin
Meter go 2 hundred something
And my trunk do wonders bumpin
I am not the one for chump'n, I will ratchet out and slump 'im, dump 'im
Your better off dead, ya money red
I'm fresh Im fly, Im always high
Got ya b-tch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm Im cool everything brand new
I don't handcuff you can get the whole damn crew
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty b-tch
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Your scheming don't affect me
Whether Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
I be movin' I be movin'
Making movies Tom Cruisin'
If its action than Im shootin'
Pockets fat, necks stuntin'
Boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named cigar called her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting
Got a white girl that be boothin
Gotta watch her cos she use it
But she f-ck me like she stupid
And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole b-tch lookin' like the 4th of July
But if you get to frontin and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussin and we leaving like it's nothin'
If it aint the Gucci or the Louie than it's Polo or its Rugby
And this b-tch that roll with me she be baggin' for me
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty b-tch
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Your scheming don't affect me
I got a girl named Kima
And Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her
Turn it over scream her
Than it's one, two, I'm through, see ya
I scoop her in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley...
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty b-tch
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
