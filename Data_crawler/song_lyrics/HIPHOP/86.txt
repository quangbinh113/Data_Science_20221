Song Name: Slave To Perfection
Mmmmh, it'll kill me
I wouldn't be surprised
It's gonna take me on a ride
I'll probably lose everything trying to get it
But that's alright
It won't take me by surprise, no
She's gotta have it going on in all the right places
She's gotta be running on a hunnit, so I can chase it
I'ma lose it, end up alone trying to get it
I'll go insane, I'm not okay 'til I get it
I'm a slave to my need for perfection
I'll go insane, I'm not okay 'til I get it
I'm a slave to my need for perfection
They say it can not be attained
But don't tease me like that
I'm like a child and if I can't get what I want
And when I want it that bad, yeah
I forget about everything
I leave it all behind
If I could just get it right, mhmm
When the stars align
I'll go insane, I'm not okay 'til I get it
I'm a slave to my need for perfection
I'll go insane, I'm not okay 'til I get it
I'm a slave to my need for perfection
