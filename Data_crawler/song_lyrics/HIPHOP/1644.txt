Song Name: Tony Starks
(M-M-M-Murda)
Wallet changed, like a rockstar (totally)
Guts red, outsides sprinkled, like a pop tart (uh)
They keep askin' questions, like they're Nardwuar (huh?)
Zaza reap the spot up, need a glass jar (ew)
Put a hole in your chest, that's Tony Stark (that's Tony)
Two of 'em in my Cullinan, then there's Noah's Ark (su')
Darth Vader coupe, and it ain't even dark (Darth Vader)
Raid up with the roof and this ain't Derek Carr (The Raiders)
Since we fell apart, I found another shard
Broke my heart so much, I had the Chrome Heart (Chrome)
Don't let no nigga try you, what my mama told me (mama)
She gon' lick it, like she Chloe, she might get a Rollie (ice)
Smokin' in this hotbox, it was a Stoley (we stole it)
Hundred racks too skinny, we call it Coi Le' (Coi Leray)
Drain my gang in pendants, my niggas love me (my niggas)
You can't afford your bitch, 'cause you out of budget (uh, gone)
I bought me a watch and bought one for my brodie (I did)
Eight ounces in the 24, that shit for Kobe (drank)
You talkin' the bag, you talkin' my cash, we send macaroni (cheese)
Geeked up while I'm walkin' 'round the crib grippin' on the stick, Toni
Strap hangin' out the side, I prefer it always be on me (for real)
Young nigga, shot fired, I guarantee they gon' stay on it
Fuck nigga can't hold me (no), bought a watch plain, then I froze it (plain)
Stayin' tin toes, I'm an OG (ten), I can get you whacked with emojis (whacked)
You know I get it for this, but that ain't what I told him (no)
He green, I know he goin' to pack, was gone before I showed him (green)
I call the stick a baked potato, 'cause it's fully loaded
I still got all my jewelry in my soul, I never sold it (I can't do that)
Wallet changed, like a rockstar (totally)
Guts red, outsides sprinkled, like a pop tart (uh)
They keep askin' questions, like they Nardwuar (huh?)
Zaza reap the spot up, need a glass jar (ew)
Put a hole in your chest, that's Tony Stark (that's Tony)
Two of 'em in my Cullinan, then there's Noah's Ark (su')
Darth Vader coupe, and it ain't even dark (Darth Vader)
Raid up with the roof and this ain't Derek Carr (The Raiders)
