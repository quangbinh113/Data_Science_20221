Song Name: Young Niggas
We from the trench, my nigga you know that we sat at the bench, my nigga
We came in from rags to riches, from ducking bullets out the tents, my nigga, uh
I know we never came in here with nothing, it turned into something, my nigga
With all my niggas on the field now, I'm facing court cases, they got real time
I'll be damned, man, I'll spend all my money before I see one of my niggas be broke
Now we getting all type of dollars, you ain't with us if you wasn't with us before
I was all at the bottom, was down on my dick, dawd, niggas left me right there on the floor
Now that I got it, I'm finally poppin', they gotta let a young nigga just get it and go
This for the ones that abandoned me
My heart is still filled with some anger
I watched you pussy niggas, made me a strategy
I seen you niggas get back at me so many times
It done only made my heart the coldest
They tried to cancel me, send me right back to the trap
With the shooters, killers, and the junkies
I give a fuck if they hatin', they been hatin'
All the drama come from bitches I been dated
Diamonds on me, yeah, they lookin' refrigerated
Like karate, got them bitches in sensei
The mighty revenge on them niggas that been played me
I dropped a Benz on them niggas, I been hated
I'm the hood nigga that poppin' and demonstratin'
Drop the top and bitches hyperventilatin'
And it's still for ones who abandoned me
You got to see me after all the tragedy
You got to see me after all the baggage
And you got to see me after all the bashin' me
I got these lil' hood niggas on go in my city
They goey, the diamonds are glowy
We heating shit up for the time it was snowy
They tried it on Tory, but they couldn't fold me
These niggas they crazy, they wanna come get me
They pointed their finger, held it up against me
The D.A. wan' stop me, the judge and the jury
I'm stepping in them all to hell in Givenchy
I jump out the jet and I don't do no regular foreign
We flying that bitch to the moon
They see the penny and pull off the panties
Young nigga get money, you could do it too
If you run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
I gotta win, God gotta help me 'cause I'm from the slums, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
Ayy, this for you hoes that done dated me
I would hope you bitches keep that energy
I got the blow on you bitches, respectively
I got to go on you niggas eventually
I got the .40, I pass to lil' brodie
Lil' shorty, he know that you niggas is dead to me
I put the battery all in his back
When I'm mixing the Hennessy up with his enemies
I tell him go and we goin', my young nigga blowin'
He throwin', we got it, we steppin', we gang and we going
I got a new Cullinan flowing all through the traffic
Through a ratchet bitch neighborhood just so she know it
I pull up and skrrt, skrrt, hit the poppers, the shottas go brrt, brrt
'Bout to send my young niggas to work, work
Pool table, bitches 'bout to twerk
They crazy, they wanna come get me
They pointed their finger, held it up against me
The D.A. wan' stop me, the judge and the jury
I'm stepping in them all to hell in Givenchy
I jump out the jet and I don't do no regular foreign
We flying that bitch to the moon
They see the penny and pull off the panties
Young nigga get money, you could do it too
If you run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
I gotta win, God gotta help me 'cause I'm from the slums, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
I gotta win, God gotta help me 'cause I'm from the slums, young niggas
