I'm married to the game, same bride, just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
'Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gon' be two soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm gettin' my dough from doin' shows
I made more dough on the grind than goin' gold
That's why I stay fly an' I'm flagin' on hoes
Floss is so cool, in Austin, no shoes
Just a rubber band on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules an' I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine when it's time for it
An' they will hate you, deal with the real cake
An' they on the corner from mornin' to real late
I deal weight an' if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustla, ask about, ask about me
I'm a hustla, I'm a, I'm a hustla, homie (yeah)

I'm a hustla, I'm a, I'm a hustla, homie (yeah)
Yeah, paid, you got saved, don't be spendin' the change
In fifth grade, I was hustlin' my Genesis games
I was dumb young, sellin' chewin' gum to my classmates
On the cash chase, movin' at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
More money, more problems is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude voice, props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hotline, I made a hot song
So, stop drawin', man, you got to respect it
I'm the best Swizz, got it perfected
Don't mess wit C-A double S-I-D-Y
'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died
The Kid do it big like P-U-N
'Cause I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N an'
I'm a hustla, I'm a, I'm a hustla, homie (yeah)
I'm a hustla, I'm a, I'm a hustla, homie (yeah)
Nigga ask, nigga, nigga ask about me (yeah)
Nigga ask a, nigga, nigga ask about me (yeah)

That's on the grind (yeah), all my niggas that ever had to hustle
To get at a dollar, this for y'all, man
Personality change, man, the Kid, Cassidy, this for the hood (yeah)
