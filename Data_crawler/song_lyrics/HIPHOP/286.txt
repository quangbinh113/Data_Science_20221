Song Name: Rotisserie
Uh, bbno$
Wassup, baby?
Skrr, skrr
Man, downtime your mother
Crazy, crazy, bro crazy
Skrrt
Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign hoe
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho (true)
Born show, born to glow, never said that (skrrt, skrrt)
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that (get it)
It's getting serious make a bitch delirious
Bitches on my dick 'cause a boy so mysterious (woah)
That's a mystery thots makin' history
Wrist keep spinnin' like a fuckin' rotisserie (skrrt)
David Letterman, I said it, man, I'm better, man (better)
She wrap me up, she wrap me up, just like the Santa, man (whoa)
I love my candy, tryna be a little sweeter man (sweet)
I'm after money, need my money, I'm a greedy man
Money on my grave, I'll run it up until I die (die)
Got some eyes on every spot, I'm flexin' like fly (fly)
I never hurt a fly, I never 'cause a homicide (nah)
If you playin with me, I'ma use some pesticide, baby (skrrt)
Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign hoe
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho (true)
Born show, born to glow, never said that (skrrt, skrrt)
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that (get it)
It's getting serious make a bitch delirious
Bitches on my dick 'cause a boy so mysterious (woah)
That's a mystery thots makin' history
Wrist keep spinnin' like a fuckin' rotisserie (skrrt)
Got my wrist whippin' (whippin')
Lookin' like a chef (chef)
Oregano in my right, 30 on my left (yah)
Pull up with the set, got the kitchen all wet
And the Cream Team comin' for your neck (lil' bitch, ooh)
I don't do shit, but my bitch got tits (tits)
Gravy walk around lookin' like a fuckin' lick (lick)
Side bitch thick, and my main bitch thick
And my oatmeal thick, bitch, I can't even pick (whoa)
Gravy be finnesin', it's a blessin' when I'm on the block
Teach your boy a lesson 'bout the flexin', bitches on a jock
Wrist so reflective, it's aggressive for a fuckin' clock
I been pourin', dressin' and caressin' on your fuckin' thot
(Holy shit)
Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign hoe
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho (true)
Born show, born to glow, never said that (skrrt, skrrt)
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that (get it)
Get it how I like
Get that hoe I like, yeah
Cash out how I like
Cash out how I like, yeah
Thotty ain't my type
Yeah, she ain't my type, yeah
40 on my wrist
What a damn life, yeah
