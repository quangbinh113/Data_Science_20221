Song Name: Butterflies
Suicide, push me to the edge and it's
Homicide, dreaming in my bed I see butterflies
I don't wanna die
I get lit when I'm off of the meds
I know this is no regular deed
I see demons surrounding my bed
Cock it back and I let it release
They know I ain't no regular beast
Getting money and watch it increase
With this racks in the back of my jeans
Imma step in this bitch and I let it go
Imma steam up the pot, Imma chop with the chop
Imma step on their block and I let it blow
We can't fuck with the opps ain't no regular pop
Imma aim at your top and I let it go
I can't settle for less I'm not like the rest
I walk in this bitch and they better know
I got people that tell me I better blow
And I'm making it happen incredible
I got a big repetition
I finish the mission
You know that I'm special edition
Don't tell me how I be living, I know what I'm doing so please do not fuck up the vision
I got me plenty of bitches I don't wanna fuck 'em, they know that I'm keeping it business
Leaving the scene with no witness, late up at night I be wishing
Suicide, push me to the edge and it's
Homicide, dreaming in my bed I see butterflies
I don't wanna die
Ay ay ay
Oh oh oh
Ay ay ay
Oh oh oh
Suicide, push me to the edge and it's
Homicide, dreaming in my bed I see butterflies
I don't wanna die
