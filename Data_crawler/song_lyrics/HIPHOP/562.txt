Damn, Callan (Damn, Callan)
One bad bitch and she do what I say so (One, gang)
Two big .40s and a big ass Draco (Two, boom, boom)
Three more millions when you ask how my day go (Three)
Poured up a four, now that blueberry Faygo
One false move, and we straight to shooting shit
Two small bands just to take you out real quick (Bands)
Three more hoes, pull up, I'm fucking shit (Three more, gang)
