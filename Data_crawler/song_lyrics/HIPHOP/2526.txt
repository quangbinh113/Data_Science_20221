Song Name: WIN 4 LOSIN (with Rylo Rodriguez)
(Vxsma)
Take medication for pain, lookin' for peace, take a flight
And I'll be gone from the mornin' through the night
Say, if I leave when it's stormin', I won't never come back
Harder to see when you young, you lived a hell of a life (hell of a life)
I live a hell of a life
You only live once, I don't think I can do this shit twice
Been tryna heal for months, but I don't think I'm doin' this shit right
They wanna see me stunt, but I don't know what I'm doin'
As the world turn, this shit can get confusin'
But I keep goin', yeah, I keep movin'
It's like I'm tryna keep goin', but I can't win for losin'
Just forgive me if I lose it, I don't mean harm
Tried to tell you I'm the one, back when I was young
When you comin' from nothin', you done already won
I light my blunts with the sun, I got the world in my palm
Cold nigga, but I can heat you up
Heard they plan on creepin' us, but them niggas ain't creepin' up
Cemeteries and the county jail, my niggas deep in there
Heard he was gangster on the street, now he weak
Been up for weeks and still ain't got a full sleep yet
Lookin' at the clock, why I ain't eat yet?
Got missed calls from my bitch, and I'm like, "Where you at? I need that"
Sorry, but it ain't a relationship that I need bad
And I'm too full for your feedback
You only live once, I don't think I can do this shit twice
Been tryna heal for months, but I don't think I'm doin' this shit right
They wanna see me stunt, but I don't know what I'm doin'
As the world turn, this shit can get confusin'
But I keep goin', yeah, I keep movin'
It's like I'm tryna keep goin', but I can't win for losin'
Money on his head, facin' all them years made him give his dog up
He locked up for traffic, but to get his time cut it was murders brought up
And his mama love him, but can't say the same thing 'bout the daughter (yeah, yeah)
And his sister hate him 'cause she can't sleep from them comin' shootin' the house up
Rylo be with jits, he make 'em go on hits and cash 'em out (yeah)
But for real, I get a driver to teach the youngins, I ain't tryna crash 'em out (mhm-mm)
Remember pullin' up when you used to see me, right now you passin' by
You can't kill nobody, I gave 'em a life sentence off this bag of 'za
Bags gettin' double, tryna pay your bills
Like, damn, judge, won't you take back away all those years?
How would you feel, you had to die in the cell?
You only live once, I don't think I can do this shit twice
Been tryna heal for months, but I don't think I'm doin' this shit right
They wanna see me stunt, but I don't know what I'm doin'
As the world turn, this shit can get confusin'
But I keep goin', yeah, I keep movin'
It's like I'm tryna keep goin', but I can't win for losin'
I keep goin' and I keep moving
You know millions is all I'm moving
