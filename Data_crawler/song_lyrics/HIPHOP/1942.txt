Song Name: Hood Nigga
All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told ya gurl you rap, but ya cd floppin'
You say you gettin money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Ya girl is persistant, she ain't stoppin'
Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', yall know we run the town
Hood nigga
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
Hood nigga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
Hood nigga
And i dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, i am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty im a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap shit is easy, every beat i get I murk
Cause im a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', you all know we run the town
Hood nigga
And i keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
Hood nigga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But i'm a keep it hood folk
Get like you, naw, get like me
Eveesus we don't rock white tees
Classic capris, but knicks on my feet
Camo bathing apes, ten pair every week
Manasha three, the gurls suck me to sleep
Z-o-e climax to the peak
I c u naw u c me
You'll see icu fuckin with me
Cause i'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', you all know we run the town
Hood nigga
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
Hood nigga
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
Hood nigga
Watchin' out for goldiggers like Kanye
But i will pay Beyonce, or Ashantay
Make Kieshia cole say she should've cheated if she eva' come my way
Get some head from fantasia on the highway
Trickin off majic city every monday
It ain't trickin if you got it that what i say, you say?
I say and what i say goes
Cuz im a hood nigga
I keep dat purt by the pound, the trunk stay bumpin', you all know we run da town
Hood nigga
And I keep a bad bitch around, thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white red brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's flats look like flapjacks, pancakes you ain't know
Hood nigga
I'm gon play the game how it goes they can take me out the hood but i'ma keep it hood folk
All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
