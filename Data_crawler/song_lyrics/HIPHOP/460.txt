Song Name: Hop Off A Jet (feat. Travis Scott)
Weezy outta here, Weezy outta here
Everythang we do, we own
Fuck a cab, let's hop off a jet (Woo, let's go,hop off a jet)
'Bout to hop off the jet (Hop off the jet, hop off the jet)
I put the glow on her wrists (Yeah),
I got that glow on my bitch (Yeah)
I keep the drum on the TEC, hop out the Cullinan, baby (Skrrt)
Won't you tell me that you tried?
Hop in a McLaren, please, let's just ride
Hop in a McLaren, zoom
Baby, tell me why you starin', zoom, yeah
Hop, hop right on a jet, uh (Yeah)
Way more smoother than a plane, yeah
Way more quicker than a 'Vette, uh (Yeah)
Teach you how to flex, pick a chain, yeah (Hop off a jet)
Bad bitch out of Marquette (Woo)
Took her out of school for the brain, yeah
She came around with the set
Nah, really ain't no savin' (Hop on the jet)
Gotta keep her mind on deck
Set, check, off X, Tech mix, stress less
I live careless, status atlas
I pulled up global, uh
I get booked, don't write books since Barnes and Noble
Top two total
Owner next top two logos (Woo)
Flex, yes, she text mess', right on my top ten
See you frequent in a place I done been
You come decent, then you leave lookin' bent
Got wet, we can dip (Woo, woo)
Fuck a cab, let's hop on a jet (Yeah, jet, hop off a jet)
Let's hop on a jet ('Bout to hop off, A motherfuckin' what? Hop on the jet)
I put the glow on her wrists, I got that glow on my bitch
I keep the drum on the TEC, hop out the Cullinan, baby
Won't you tell me that you tried?
Hop in a McLaren, please, let's just ride
Hop in a McLaren, zoom
Baby, tell me why you starin', zoom, yeah (Tell me why you starin')

Packin' that Smith & Wesson when I crave (Wait)
Hop in a big body Maybach and it's glazed (Woo)
Tell me why the fuck do you slay? (Ooh)
Why you killin' bitches with no grave? (Yeah, hop off a jet)
I got a 'Vette, breakin' her neck (Yeah, woo, hop off a jet)
Drum on the TEC, engraved headrest (Hop off a jet)
Just watered my wrist, baguettes, woah, you know I'm a vet (Vet)
Hop off the jet with an A and a K and a
Three-headed snake (Yeah, yeah, hop off a jet)
All of the coupes exotic and I'm
Ducked off with your bae (Yeah, yeah), yeah
I told you my niggas don't like you,
You niggas get (Yeah, yeah), yeah
Had to tell these lil' niggas my wrist
And my ankle a lake, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Had to tell 'em they bitch can come get on
My shit and just stay, when I hop off the jet
Let's hop off a jet (Let's go, hop off a jet)
When I hop off the jet (When I hop off the jet,hop off the jet)
I put the glow on her wrists, I got that glow on my bitch
I keep the drum on the TEC, hop out the Cullinan, baby
Won't you tell me that you tried?
Hop in a McLaren, please, let's just ride
Hop in a McLaren, zoom
Baby, tell me why you starin', zoom, yeah
