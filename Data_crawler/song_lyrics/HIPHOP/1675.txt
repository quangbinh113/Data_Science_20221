Song Name: Everything
Gone in one minute
Pull up in the supercar
This joint limited edition
Tried to tell you ahead of time
I wish you would have listened
Never tryna hold the ball
I'm cool with the assist
I just hope lil bruh don't miss
I can't lie, someone den pissed me off
I'm back up on that shit
Treat them niggas block like Lenox Mall, we go in there and spin
I know niggas mad I'm number one and they want me to falla
I got bad bitches, supermodels, I don't even call
All the youngins who be drilling shit you know that come with life
Niggas barely try to send you shit
You know they ain't gone write
What you talkin' bout in real life
I can't get caught up in the hype
She like why you drive like that
I can't get caught up at no light
Know my nigga was dead wrong
I stand behind him like he right
Spent 400 on a Richard Mill
I call that wasting time
Tried to give you every sign
It got me wonderin' is you blind
We together when you wit me
When you leavin' you ain't mine, yea
You owe me for everything
Ima take it all the way to the grave before I drop a name
You den took a piece of my lil heart so it won't be the same
I den got enough to give us all some, we den beat the game, yea
You owe me for everything
Ima take it all the way to the grave before I drop a name
You den took a piece of my lil heart so it won't be the same
I den got enough to give us all some, we den beat the game, yea
Used to be a time when I couldn't give a thing
Never wanna see you go out bad, I tried to give you game
You gone throw my feelings in the trash
And leave it in the rain
Ima leave my feelings in the past
I won't come back again (yea)
Love it when she come to see me and she wear a sundress
I be going stupid in that shit, we having dumb sex
She be tryna do it better, turn it to a contest
I be smoking rapper weed, I know she get a contact
Always switch my number but somehow she stay in contact
Stand up for my hood, the whole zone 4
You know I run that
Ain't nobody went up top on me and I ain't punch back
My dog gone on a life sentence
Pay whatever for him to come back
I been stackin' M's like they souvenirs, yea, yea
I spent 80 grand on some new veneers, yea, yea
I been tearing the town up in that new McLaren, yea, yea
Ima show my ass for times that I ain't have it (I ain't have it)
You owe me for everything
Ima take it all the way to the grave before I drop a name
You den took a piece of my lil heart so it won't be the same
I den got enough to give us all some, we den beat the game, yea
You owe me for everything
Ima take it all the way to the grave before I drop a name
You den took a piece of my lil heart so it won't be the same
I den got enough to give us all some, we den beat the game, yea
