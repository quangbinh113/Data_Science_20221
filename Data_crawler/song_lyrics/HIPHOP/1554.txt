Song Name: Heavenâ€™s EP (with J. Cole)
(I'm working on dying)
Yeah (and like that)
Gotta have a space, gotta have a space (it's been a pleasure)
Nah mean? (She belongs to the streets)
Freedom, nah mean? (We gone)
Uh (Gangsta Grillz) space to get this shit off
Yeah
Yeah (get this shit off my mind, off my chest)
Yeah (nah mean?)
Yeah
With every record, I be askin' the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately I've been questionin', second guessin'
Whether or not I've got somethin' to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down? That truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin' back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself, "Whatever you do, you won't do it partially"
From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail proof philosophy
Success is in the effort, so if a nigga tried his hardest
I'm at peace knowin' God ain't deal it in this group of cards for me
Some people say that I'm runnin' third, they threw the bronze at me
Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them niggas is superstars to me
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of my luminosity
So when you see me on red carpets, I'm movin' awkwardly
Posin' all nervous, afraid of the judgement
And the thought of showin' too much of my day is repugnant
I be keepin' my kids away from the gaze of the public
'Cause these days, it feel like hate is they favorite subject
Fuck it, attitude like a young O'Shea with a AK
Aimed at your brain, violate, and I bust it
I don't play when it come to family, that's one thing I refuse
Pimpin' they kids out for views to just to be in the news
Could never be me, I piss in the celebrity tea
God with me on this record, this is Heaven's EP
The tales official, the best nigga breathin'
It just failed to hit you
You couldn't tell 'cause you fell for the bells and whistles
And that's an area I don't excel
I'm from the 'Ville where young girls talk grown as hell
That's raw, never saw one person go to Yale
But every nigga that I know done gone to jail
At least once, provin' we the ones police hunt
For the pains, we smoke three blunts the size of tree trunks
Too much hunger, it's no wonder these niggas can't keep up
So sayin', "Yes" to a feature just means I'm 'bout to eat lunch, bitch
I'm goin' for it, no never shall he punt
I'm the one and you can be sure, speakin' of beachfront
I'm kickin' my feet up while I write this in somewhere tropical
Supposed to be relaxin', this passion makes that impossible, mm (Gangsta)
Supposed to be relaxin', this passion makes that impossible
Follow the leaders
Another Gangsta Grillz classic
Like I never left
