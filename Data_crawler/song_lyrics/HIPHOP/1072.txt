Song Name: Yebbaâ€™s Heartbreak
How much better can I show my love for you
Than say "I do, I do, I do"?
I do, I do, I do
You may not know right where you're going, but
I do, I do, I do
And all the times you wasn't chosen, well, I'll make it up to you
All of the feelings you're not showing
When your river's overflowing, mmm
It's the truth, swear to you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
And all that you are, I do
My single line of stars in noon
Reflection of the very moon, I do
I do, I do, I do
Show my love for you
Can I show my love for you?
(Can I show my love for you?)
