Song Name: Cigarettes
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh

Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showing her that I love her, tryna show her a effort
Gotta keep it together-er
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
Oh, oh, this a love letter that I wrote
She keep me up when I'm feeling low
She's my overdose-dose-dose
Being heartbroken is so last year
Having breakdowns and she wiping my tears
I've been feeling fine ever since she been mine
In other words, yeah, she changed my life
Open up like a book, let her read me
One call away if she ever needs me
If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together
Treat me like a promise, baby, keep me forever
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S. baby girl, you're so gorgeous
Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showing her that I love her, tryna show her a effort
Gotta keep it together-er
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
I could talk about her all day
She's on my mind, always
As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
Thinking bout her all day
She's on my mind, always
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S baby girl, you're so gorgeous
Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showing her that I love her, tryna show her a effort
Gotta keep it together-er
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
