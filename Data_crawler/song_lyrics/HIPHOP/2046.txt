Incredible, icki-icki, general
I just start the label just to sign me (woo, woo, woo), uh

We've been on the run, feel like a crime spree, talk to me nicely (yeah)
I seen his face, seen it
Yup, on his white tee (let's go), yeah
Yup, call the Sprite people (call 'em, hol' on, brrt)
Private flight to France, tryna sight-see (on private flights, brrat)
Popped 'em in his hands, he was typin' (da, da, da)
Caterpillar 'Rari, I fold it, lift it up (up)
I went on the stand, told the judge to pass my cup (ayy)
Ran up 20 million, told the Devil, "Keep the luck" (luck)
Keep that, keep that hoe (uh-uh)
R.I.P. Pop, keep the smoke (ayy, slatt)

Mississippi, dip a sippy, make 'em happy, make 'em copy
Make 'em get me Chippi Chippi (yeah)
There's a lot I'm gon' spend
Tell me when, I beam you to pull up, you gon' shootout while I spin
Trippin' like I'm trigger happy, saltfish, ackee, ackee
Golf buggy, Kawasaki, catch a fish, sushi, maki, livin' life
London city, left the town (ah)
Thug and Travis be the fam
Yup, yeah, you know that (slatt)
And when they free us out, it's gonna be a film, a Kodak (yeah)
Shoot me pourin' right above the rim like Pollack
I've been rippin' and runnin', not slippin' or slidin', athletic tendencies
I've been up since, cheffin' it, whippin' it to the base rock
I provide the remedy (let's go)
When we open gates up at Utopia (it's lit), it's like Zootopia
You see the crosses over ya (yeah), that's how you know it's us
At 4:00 a.m. I'm phonin' ya, not for no shoulder rub
Them JACKBOYS open cleaners up, the way they fold and tuck
Yup, in my white tee (yeah), yeah
Call up Hype Williams for the hype, please, yeah
They gon' wipe you, before you wipe me, yeah
Unboxing my checks, not my
Checks, not my
I-I be where the fuck the light be
Bangers in the system, it's
Bangers in the system, it's
Ancient Anunnaki
Bangers in the system, it's that
Bangers in the system, it's that
M.I.A.
