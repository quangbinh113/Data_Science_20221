Song Name: Perfect Timing
We did some shit that we was never 'posed to do
If I ain't put you down, you still wouldn't have a clue
They say you get around, so what to me, you new
Just know I'm down for whatever you wanna do
But lately I been indecisive, it's probably best for you to choose
New Ferrari cost an M, if you want one, I'm buying two
Fell in love with stacking hunnids plus my favorite color blue
Started all this shit with nothing, ain't no way that I can lose
If I run into the opps, then we gone eat, bruh say they food
Hunnid million dollars cash inside the room, yeah, that's my mood
Ain't seen the hood in a minute, but shh, I'm still in tune
We got sticks and we outside, I live my life like I'm a goon
We fell in love with shit we never 'posed to love
You start acting out of character, I blame it on the drugs
I gave everything I could, I guess my good ain't good enough
Had some people fuck me over, so I keep my guard up
New Ferrari got two motors, gas station, charge up
I remember tryna run it up to snatch a charger
I told brodie keep his prayers up, know God got us
I been showing too much love, if I keep going, my heart'll bust
They know they can't fuck with us
I see her, I get a rush
Don't go missing, stay in touch
I won't fold or bend or break, I swear I'm solid as they come
I am not lil' dude, he might be two, but he cannot be one
I walk out, my hand on my gun, I gotta make it back to my son
Dive in the end zone, I can't fumble
Invest a couple M's with my mama
Live like Jack but I don't like drama
Bulletproof Cadillacs like Obama
They know to shoot first, no warning
Sometimes staying focused get boring
I'm tryna touch a hunnid on this run
Bottega bomber on this shit foreign, yeah
Bitches trifling, niggas sniping, ain't no love, a nigga'll hit your baby mom
Tom Ford jacket, bell-bottoms, ain't going to prom though
Marble countertop, heated floors, I'm from the slum, hoe
I play as the glue in this shit and make sure we stick together
Brodie lost his life, and it inspired me to get my shit together
Ain't no sense in me putting time in if it don't even matter
If you don't get it, you throw a fit, and I'm starting to peep a pattern
You could've just brushed that off, you had to be dramatic
765 McLaren, this ain't the one they got
Brabus truck at least half a ticket, I got it in the projects
If anything, I tried to help you, I ain't never try to knock you
We fell in love with shit we never 'posed to love
You start acting out of character, I blame it on the drugs
I gave everything I could, I guess my good ain't good enough
Had some people fuck me over, so I keep my guard up
Bitches trifling, niggas sniping, ain't no love, a nigga'll hit your baby mom
Tom Ford jacket, bell-bottoms, ain't going to prom though
Marble countertop, heated floors, I'm from the slum, hoe
