Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Driving downtown, just waiting for you (waiting for you)
Got an R&B playlist playing for you (playing for you)
Pull up, beep-beep, I'm swerving (swerving)
In a new big body suburban (swerving)
Hold up, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Slow down, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Keep doing that shit on purpose (purpose)
Swinging that shit on purpose (on purpose)
Swear I love the way you work it
Hoes calling and it ain't no service, yeah
Waiting all my life, I've been waiting all my life all for you, yeah
Try to hold it back, I can't hide it, I'm excited,
I become alive with you, yeah, yeah
I was riding downtown, top down (skrr)
Just thinking 'bout your touch right now
I ain't felt this way in a while now
So girl you know what's up
Pull up, beep-beep, I'm swervin' (swervin')
Soon as I see you, it's curtains (it's curtains)
I'ma beat the pussy up, murk it (beat it up)
We be goin' 730 (Scorin')
When she throw it back, I serve it
Look at that ass, so perfect
All of these niggas, they lurking
But that's all mine's for certain, yeah
I was driving downtown, just waiting for you (waiting for you)
Got an R&B playlist playing for you (playing for you)
Pull up, beep beep, I'm swerving (swerving)
In a new big body suburban (swerving)
Hold up, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Slow down, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Keep doing that shit on purpose (purpose)
Swinging that shit on purpose (on purpose)
Swear I love the way you work it (work it)
Hoes calling and it ain't no service, yeah
I was driving downtown, just waiting for you (waiting for you)
Got an R&B playlist playing for you (playing for you)
Pull up, beep beep, I'm swerving (swerving)
In a new big body suburban (swerving)
Hold up, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Slow down, girl, you're making me nervous (nervous)
Keep doing that shit on purpose (purpose)
Swinging that shit on purpose (on purpose)
Swear I love the way you work it (work it)
Hoes calling and it ain't no service, yeah
