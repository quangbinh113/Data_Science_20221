Song Name: No Child Left Behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
Always count on God

Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
Always count on Godã…¤
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
