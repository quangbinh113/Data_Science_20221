Song Name: Leave Me On Read
I hit you with that double text
Where you at? What you doin'? You ain't seen it yet
I'm seein' blue, blue, blue, baby, that's a bag, uh
Call you one time, 'cause I gotta check, ooh-ooh
How you not gon' answer? Postin' on your Insta'
Baby, where your manners? Don't you know I hit ya? Ayy
Silence ain't that good, talkin' more expensive
You act like I ain't worthy of no second chances
Oh, you mad-mad, huh?
That's what's you're best at, huh?
Girl, it's only midnight, oh-oh
So why you gotta go and
Leave me on read
Flexin', actin' like you didn't get the message
Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read

I'm stressin', actin' like you didn't get the message

Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
I know you saw my text, it's been 15 minutes (Woah)
You be 'round your girl, you just want attention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now you talkin' crazy, need an intervention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I tried to tell you once but you ain't never listen
So, you mad-mad, huh?
That's what's you're best at, huh?
Girl, it's only midnight, oh-oh
So why you gotta go and
Leave me on read
Flexin' (Flexin'), actin' like you didn't get the message (Message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes (Exes)
You ain't gotta, leave me on read (Oh, oh)
I'm stressin' (Oh, oh)
Actin' like you didn't get the message (Oh, oh)
Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
Hahahaha
Baby, you don't gotta leave a nigga on read
Know you see text message, text me back
Aight please, goddamn
You ain't gotta (You ain't gotta)
Leave me on read
Flexin', actin' like you didn't get the message (Get the message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes (To my exes)
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
I'm stressin' (I know you saw my text, please)
Actin' like you didn't get the message (I know you got the message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin' to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
