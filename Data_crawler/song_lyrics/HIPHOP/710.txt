Song Name: Dance Like No Oneâ€™s Watching
What in the fuck is the reason?
But anybody could be watchin'
What in the
What in the, what in the
What in the, what in the
What in the fuck is the reason?
I want the check, comin' in some
I'm goin' up until I'm gone
You won't even know 'til the day come
Pop bottles, not them lil' teacups
Hashtags for gang and my loved ones
Fuck my old one, we been done
But I ain't holdin' on no grudge
Told that little baby "Come shake some"
Happy endin', yeah, I'm tryna get some
I mixed the sex with the reefa
Laura, Sasha, Alisha
Someone tell Elon to link up
Blow loud in the Tesla, it's lout like the speaker
She don't come to the club in no sneakers
Pockets stay further than people
Louis rag, wipe me right up
Baby, I'm feelin' the freedom

Dance like no one's watchin'
Dance like no one's watchin'
I need someone non-toxic
The money, the bitches, the log in
I'm thinking we just need to lock it in
Dance like no one's watchin', ooh
Dance like no one's watchin', ooh

Shawty shake that ass, say she can't even help
You step to the right, yeah, hop to the left
Two women to myself, yeah, I'm just being selfish
We smoke out this bitch with top shelf
New whips, new rocks, wax on, wax off
Wheel poppin', so I had to make a pit-stop
Tipped out, where I think she finna quit her job
Got her ass goin' viral on TikTok
Everybody don't need to know you're gettin' dough
Slice some big bread, then you cut a lot of hoes
Bandana on the nigga with the Kenzo
B.B. Simon on me when I do the show
Dance like no one's watchin'
Dance like no one's watchin'
I need someone non-toxic
The money, the bitches, the log in
I'm thinkin' we just need to lock it in
Dance like no one's watchin'
Dance like no one's watchin'
Countin' up the money 'til my head catch a cramp
All these bitches gettin' paid
Makin' love to the money, so out of breath
Ridin' in the whip, and I'm just doin' laps
Sippin' on Fuego, fuck up my G-Fazos
Twist like a Faygo, these bitches is preggo
Don't call me Simon, but do what I say so
