Song Name: Life Insurance (feat. Lil Tjay)
Banger
Gotta get on my knees, thank God, for sure
'Cause I was livin' like I had life insurance
Gotta pray and talk to Christ for sure
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger) 'cause I was gamblin' with my life, for sure
Ayy, ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before
Ooh, gotta pray and talk to Christ, for sure
'Cause, ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance
Ooh, I was gamblin' with my life, for sure
Ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before
Ooh, I ain't never did nothing right b–µfore
Get on my knees, yeah (amen)
Run up that cheese, yeah (Let's get it)
Loyalty, yeah (What you say?)
Loyalty, yeah (only way)
Got a lot to be thankful for, I got a lot to cry about (facts)
Know a lot of sh- that I can only talk with God about (man)
S- that I wished, it start comin' true, I had to watch my mouth
A billion of my people straight
Some s- that I can't die without (I can't)
Foreign s-, I'm whippin' off, they want me to give it out (What?)
I remember I went without in the trenches without that extendo out like baow
Ayy, ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before (talk to 'em)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (never did nothing right)
Ooh, gotta pray and talk to Christ, for sure (got to)
'Cause, ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (nigga, I was)
Ooh, I was gamblin' with my life, for sure (nigga, I was)
Ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (amen)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (I did it)
Ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before
Trench kid gangster, I was really out there with them ooters
Huh, forty banger, I keep this s- 'cause it bust medullas
Huh,30 stick up in this shit, I call this bitch a ruler
Huh, VVS's, I got my shit from Benny jeweler
- Know me and my body
Curryed up, I ain't movin' 'round sloppy
Curryed up, I be movin' 'round properly
Think you keep playing with who? -, not me
Had to homici' first 'cause he shot me
In my city, they know me, I'm oppy
I'm a youngin, gon' do it and cocky
I done got ocky, who could have stopped me?
We really turn up gang like a Nazi
I know lil' bro gon' do it for the drill
I know a lot of niggas wanna flop me
But I still chill when I'm in the field
We upped the score, but I be wantin' more
I done seen opposition on the floor
I done seen hundred showers when it pour
I can't see no more, so I'ma ignore
I dare a n- run up on the gang
Bet you that - run up on his pole
Bet you he's never ever gon' react
No cockin' it back, we keep it on go
I mix the dummy lato with the spliff
I mix the dummy lato with the toe
Them - hating, I be getting checks
Can't fuck with the racks, they know I'm a pro (grrt)
Ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before (I ain't never)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (I ain't never)
Ooh, gotta pray and talk to Christ, for sure (I got to)
'Cause, ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (that shit crazy)
Ooh, I was gamblin' with my life, for sure (I was)
Ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (I got to)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (I ain't never)
Ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before (I ain't never)
Two bricks on my sleeve, yeah (two)
Two bands on my jeans, yeah (two)
You can't - with me, yeah (they can't)
You can't - with me, yeah (-, you can't)
Thanking God 'cause he let me have it my way (amen)
I just bought a mansion, I got choppers by the fireplace
Can't let me in, but I was never alone 'cause I had God (He was there)
Big bro say we gotta live even if they gotta die (- fucked)
We not no evil people, but we gon' survive (-, you know we is)
Turn this - into Iraq when it come to me and mine, ayy (-, you know we is, ayy)
Ayy, ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before (I ain't never)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (I ain't never)
Ooh, gotta pray and talk to Christ, for sure (I got to)
'Cause, ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (That shit crazy)
Ooh, I was gamblin' with my life, for sure (I was)
Ooh, I was livin' like I had life insurance (I got to)
Ooh, I ain't never lived this life before (I ain't never)
Ooh, I ain't never did nothing right before (I ain't never)
Gotta get on my knees, thank God, for sure
'Cause I was livin' like I had life insurance
Gotta pray and talk to Christ, for sure
'Cause I was gamblin' with my life, for sure
