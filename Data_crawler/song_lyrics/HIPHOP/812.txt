Song Name: LOW KEY (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)
Yeah (oh, Doe Beezy)
Doe Beezy, ayy (real nigga shit, man real nigga shit, man)
You talkin' too much
(That boy, Cassius)
I don't fuck with no snitches (yeah, yeah), she don't either (let's go)
Big-ass Chanel bag hold my extension, I'm gon' keep her, aww (grrah, bah)
Know I got bitches, but she don't be trippin'
But I don't either, nah (Doe Beezy)
Drop top coupe, me and her, two-seater
Ain't tellin' our business, she know I'ma keep it (let's go)
Me and lil' shawty just vibin', don't want attention, we hidin'
All of these niggas be choosin', she never mindin'
She know I'm sidin' (Doe Beezy)
Baby, you know how I'm rockin'
You the one type I let empty my pockets, gang
Me and lil' shawty be mobbin'
We be lowkey 'cause the haters be watchin' (let's go)
She always bring out my weakness (woo)
But she take my weakness for kindness (let's go)
Everything she wear is high-end, me too
Good material, what's the climate? (Ah)
Save her under "Glue" 'cause we always bindin'
Put diamonds on her neck like my niggas minin'
Uh-huh (whoa), suck it up, use her brain
She don't mind it (whoa, whoa)
Ritz Carlton, no, this is not the Hyatt
I'm gon' delete it but right now it's tonight
My girls got clips, they 30s, agin' with time
We got choppas, cannot aim with no nine
Know I'm patient, no, I'm not in a rush (yeah)
Yes, I know I had to wait in that line (let's go)
Opportunity hit different this side
But I'd rather just hit it from behind (yeah)
I don't fuck with no snitches (yeah, yeah), she don't either (let's go)
Big-ass Chanel bag hold my extension, I'm gon' keep her, aww (grrah, bah)
Know I got bitches, but she don't be trippin'
But I don't either, nah (Doe Beezy)
Drop top coupe, me and her, two-seater
Ain't tellin' our business, she know I'ma keep it (let's go)
Me and lil' shawty just vibin', don't want attention, we hidin'
All of these niggas be choosin', she never mindin'
She know I'm sidin' (Doe Beezy)
Baby, you know how I'm rockin'
You the one type I let empty my pockets, gang
Me and lil' shawty be mobbin'
We be lowkey 'cause the haters be watchin' (let's go)
She got niggas, I got bitches, pay 'em no attention, we not trippin'
Just me and you, baby, we not slippin'
Don't want drama, no, we not with it
She do it, she tell me she did it, damn
I respect she admit and she respectin' my pimpin', damn
We just 'posed to be chillin' but we gon' end up catchin' feelings (oh, really?)
Just me and her in the Wraith, we lookin' up at the ceilin' (skrrt, vroom)
Come help me load up this pistol, come help me count up this million
Damn, what you did to me? Gangsters ain't 'posed to have feelings
One thing in common, don't fuck with no snitches
Gangsters ain't 'posed to tell business
I don't fuck with no snitches (yeah, yeah), she don't either (she don't either)
Big-ass Chanel bag hold my extension, I'm gon' keep her, nah
Know I got bitches, but she don't be trippin'
But I don't either, nah (but I don't either)
Drop top coupe, me and her, two-seater
Ain't tellin' our business, she know I'ma keep it (oh, really? Yeah)
Me and lil' shawty just vibin', don't want attention, we hidin'
All of these niggas be choosin', she never mindin'
She know I'm sidin' (Doe Beezy)
Baby, you know how I'm rockin'
You the one type I let empty my pockets, gang
Me and lil' shawty be mobbin'
We be lowkey 'cause the haters be watchin' (oh, yeah, Doe Beezy)
