Come fuck with me, I put you in Givenchy

I pull up and I put this in the frenzy
I'm whipping with my hand up on the Lambo'
Drive for the ride, yeah

Got a full time job, shawty
Took it off for the night, yeah
I'm the nigga that you like
I'ma beat it up for life
I ain't never 'bout to lie
If you won't give me that tonight, night, night, night
Fifteen bands, I got fifteen bands on me
If I switch to ones, she gon' switch that ass on me
Seen these hood niggas try to switch, they pass on me
But what they ain't know is that .40 cal always on me
And I won't stop
I'm on your block, with my chains on
In the rain, oh, like an Usher video
Woo-ooh, hahaha

Wanna pull up to the scene in that new big body (Body)
Bad lil' baby, yeah, she riding right beside me (Beside me)
All these bands (Bands), busting out my pants (Pants)
Slide with me, shawty, I'm just tryna flex (Flex), yeah yeah
