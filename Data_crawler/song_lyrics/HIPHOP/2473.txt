Song Name: Stone Cold
Said he callin' from Atlanta, say he miss me
Well, well, well
Guess he better send that private out to get me
Expect this to be a long cold winter
You fuckin' with a stone cold sinner
Fuckin' with me, you got no regrets
Fuckin' on me, know I do it best
Fuckin' on you, only want the neck
I know how it goes
Say he fall in love every time he kiss me
Well, well, well
And you always right on time, that's what gets me (Gets me)
Am I еver on your mind when you not with me? (With mе)
Maybe you and I should start a family
What you sayin'? Follow through
Baby, take the lead, show me what to do
I'm intrigued, everything 'bout your demeanor
How I'm comin' crazy, but I'm never leavin'
Said he callin' from Atlanta, say he miss me
Well, well, well
Guess he better send that private out to get me
Expect this to be a long cold winter
You fuckin' with a stone cold sinner
Fuckin' with me, you got no regrets
Fuckin' on me, know I do it best
Fuckin' on you, only want the neck
I know how it goes, I ain't impressed
Baby, I've seen this before
I assumed you wanted more
You just wanna up the score
Know that you know there's more tonight
Said that you a freak, tell me, is it true?
Wanna see the receipts, baby, can you follow through?
Take me up out these jeans, won't you fuck me in a booth?
Say you a P, baby, let me see the proof
Said he callin' from Atlanta, say he miss me (Well, well)
Well, well, well
Guess better send that private out to get me (Yeah)
Expect this to be a long cold winter (Yeah)
You fuckin' with a stone cold sinner (Oh, oh)
Fuckin' with me, you got no regrets (With me)
Fuckin' on me, know I do it best (I do it best)
Fuckin' on you, only want the neck
I know how it goes, I ain't impressed (I ain't impressed)
Said he callin' from Atlanta, say he miss me
Well, well, well
