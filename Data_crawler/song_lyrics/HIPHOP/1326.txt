Song Name: Flowers (Say My Name) [feat. Lil Tecca] - Remix
Whoa, baby
ArrDee, ArrDee
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
Nah, babe, I can't make your day
But I can make your night
See, I ain't the trustin' type and it's lust, not love
And she said, "I'm done this time 'cause
You make love to me like I'm the one
Then run off and duck my calls for a month
Make me feel special and then like a mug
Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts"
Aw, come back, darling why you rantin'?
Girl, I'm single, and I always have been
Never promised you nothin' but panting
Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics
She said "You don't show me no respect
And you're only callin' me for the sex"
At least I call 'cause the rest just all come crawlin'
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I just do what I want, baby, that's something you should know
Creepin' 'round the crib with different shawties really got me movin' on my tiptoes
I gotta move like the chief, yeah, overseas, I call ArrDee, yeah
You not my shawty so why you be callin' my phone tryna see where I be? Yeah
Tell me what you need
She want benefits, I'm down too
I wouldn't be trippin' without you
I'll be good regardless, baby, even if I never found you
Put in my hours
Sayin' the truth, ain't no coward
I really don't got no manners
I am not gettin' no-
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling
You probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
Those tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away
