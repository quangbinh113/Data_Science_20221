Song Name: So Real
SephGotTheWaves
Oh-oh
Uh, say she is the truth, say she is so real
And I love the way that you make me feel
When it's time to show affection again
Look her in her eyes like, "You're mine", that's no lie
Come on, I'll take you where you need to go
Tell you whatever you need to know
'Cause we for sure, I'll keep you close, won't sleep alone
Passionate, give you the deepest stroke
Soarin' through these skies, trips to Dubai
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied
Tears of a warrior, I have some battle cries
Know you wonderin' how I survived, oh
And I hate it when we break up, different hoes and liquor
All night I stayed up, starin' at your picture
Them hard times made us, my heart for you got bigger
Don't think I'll ever find somethin' realer
Uh, say she is the truth, say she is so real
And I love the way that you make me feel
When it's time to show affection again
Look her in her eyes like, "You're mine", that's no lie
May 18th, nine o'clock, L.A. time
I remember that's the first day we FaceTimed
Now even when it's gloomy, still know how to make my day shine
On the road to forever, we can't fall by the wayside
Real street nigga, love you like my first gun
Forever grateful for you, blessed me with my first son
Bonnie and Clyde, baby, let's go on the run
Play you for your heart, girl, let's have a one-on-one
Treat this love like a religion 'cause I believe in you
Somethin' like a guardian angel, that when I needed you
Never had to question a thing, I know that she the truth
Always showed me nothin', but loyalty when I needed proof
Uh, say she is the truth, say she is so real
And I love the way that you make me feel
When it's time to show affection again
Look her in her eyes like, "You're mine," that's no lie
