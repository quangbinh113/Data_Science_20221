Song Name: LEMONHEAD (feat. 42 Dugg)
Y'all niggas know what's up
You say, you say pandemic? (Yeah)
Oh, you wanna see a pandemic? (Bunnyhop)
You should remove us from the game
I don't lean
This shit really get crazy
I don't lean
Gangsta Grillz (yeah)
I don't lean, but my house do
Off the hill with the mean view (yeah)
Nice house, if you look out
You could see some eagles and a few yachts
Got a roommate, he won't move out
If you want smoke, he the cool aunt
And he drill shit, got the tool out
It's the Wolf Gang, Brooklyn Zoo out (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Nigga, Wu-Tang, you get chewed out
Then we woo-hah, this is Flipmode
And they know you're pussy like the douche out
Bitch, I'm koo-koo and his mouth wet (cuckoo, cuckoo)
He a pool now, used to stage dive, but they sue now
I was too hot, TLC waterfalls on my chest help me cool out (ah)
Got too many cars, shit a go-kart (yeah)
They're catching dust, won't even start (yeah)
Earlobe with Lemonheads, looking like Bart
Keep your Patek, I spent that on art (spent that on art, nigga)
How much it cost? Shit, I don't know (nah)
But I know that stage a million a show (true story)
Stuck in my ways, they say, "How so?"
First nigga put a bike rack on a Rolls, T (fuck with me)
A young turnt nigga, I be fucking these hoes
20 appearances, I get it, I go (I'm here)
Rich, tell the world, "Come see me out low"
I ain't rocking with cuz, nigga, free my bros (trez)
I ain't got no safe, niggas see me shining (bitch, huh)
Still fuck, I'm grindin' (lame)
80 for a gram, remind 'em (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Two-tone Patek in this bitch, got dammit (ayy, ho)
Ten bad hoes, nigga, look at that bitch (look at her)
Still selling dope, I be cooking that shit (man, for real, dog shit)
My hoodie like six bands (look, dog shit)
Over a hunnid (yeah, yeah)
I'm from the bottom, bitch, we getting money
Might tip a good hoe, but then she ain't getting nothing
Car go skrrt, hold on (ha, pretty good, start it up)
Nigga, you got lucky (skrrt)
All this paper, I can bet she fuck
I ain't doing no talking, I ain't doing no saving (no, no, no)
Took her from a lame, I'll give this bitch back (here)
Don't act crazy, nigga still tote straps
Like, "Get on, bitch, just spit on that shit"
Man, oh my God, "Remember lil'-?"
Yeah, he got dropped (hold on), I'm gone (we gone)
Biatch!

Call on me (my bro is)
If you get lost (running his fingers through th-the Ai WeiWei, Ai VeiVei bowl)
Call on me (I got that shit sitting on my counter like a fruit bowl, that's like 100 racks)
If you get lost (I like the color green, in every shade)
If you get lost (I like life)
Call on me (mine, like, my life)
If you get lost (don't fucking bite, y'all niggas love to steal)
