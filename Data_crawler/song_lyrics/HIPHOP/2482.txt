Song Name: My Way
Enviyon on the mix
Queen shit, bitch (my way)
Damn
These hoes don't know what life about
If money talk, then when the bitch converse, she type it out
That nigga can't get no cash, he just swipe it out
My generation going downhill, it's wiping out
Meanwhile, I'm turnt as fuck
I left my pizza in the oven, that bitch burnt as fuck
A lotta cheese to go around, bitch, I could turn you up
A lot of these lil' bitches cool, but they be weak as fuck
Time to sweep it up, neat as fuck
My way, my way, or the highway
My way, my way, or the highway
My way, my way (or the driveway)
My way, my way (I got my own shit, I think I'm on, bitch)
My way, my way, my way
My way, my way, my way
M-my way, my way, or the highway
My way (my way)
My way
I'm a spoiled ass bitch, I'ma get what I wish
If that nigga got a problem, he can suck his own dick (honey)
I got my own shit (bitch), I think I'm on bitch (bitch)
I'm 21 years old and I got my own business
My way, told that nigga, "I'm a business"
My way, bitch, mind yo' fuckin' business
My way, I got zero fuckin' children
My way, I'm just focused on the millions
Call it my way, yo' nigga get no play
'Cause a nigga got no weight, and he so gay
'Cause a nigga gon' obey anything I'm gon' say
'Cause I'm Queen Key (queen)
And that bitch wanna be me
And that nigga wanna see me
But I leave that bitch like "poof"
My bundles blowing out the roof
On the highway (on the highway)
Left yo' nigga in my driveway (in my driveway)
You ain't know? He be there every Friday
Bitch, my bae
Goofy bitch, damn near my bae
My bae, bitch, my way
My way, my way, highway
My way (my way)
