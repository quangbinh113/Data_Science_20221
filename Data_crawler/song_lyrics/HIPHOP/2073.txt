Song Name: Insane in the Brain
Who you tryin' to get crazy with Ã©se?
Don't you know I'm loco?
To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, feel done when I come in slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me goin' like General Electric
And the lights are blinkin', I'm thinkin'
It's all over when I go out drinkin'
Oh, makin' my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big four, oh
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Do my shit undercover now it's time for the blubba
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack your ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat like a sumo, slammin dat ass
Leavin' your face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a chulo, lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip dat main frame, I'll explain
A nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in the brain (in the brain)
It's because I'm loco
Insane in the brain (in the brain)
It's because I'm loco
Insane in the brain (in the brain)
Insane (it's because I'm loco)
Insane in the brain
Don't shot me, boy
Like Louie Armstrong played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break ya off somethin' soon
I got ta get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine deuce Cad
Yes, I'm the pirate, pilot of this ship
If I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is goin insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in the brain)
Insane in the brain
It's because I'm loco
Insane in the brain
It's because I'm loco
Insane in the brain
It's because I'm loco
Insane in the brain
It's because I'm loco
