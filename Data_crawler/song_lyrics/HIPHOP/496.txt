Song Name: Another Day Gone (feat. Khalid)
On Goyard luggages, I'm blowin' your budget
How you gon' tell me I'm bugging when I came from nothing?
Even if you don't love me, don't change for nothing
But why wouldn't you love me?
You keep some lighters in your bag
Couple of grams in my lap and we'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone, you're tired
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone
If I ever call you my baby, girl, I mean you really my baby
And I can't (yeah, yeah), can't even stop
Thinkin' 'bout you, I'm addicted, I swear I ain't even tripping
'Cause you could've been (yeah)
Bartendin', you could've been stripping or even (yeah)
Out here fucking somebody just to get even
'Cause no matter where I go, you think I'm cheating
And I know you miss me, girl
'Cause my diamonds shine bright like the moonlight, yeah
You ain't gotta catch a red-eye, fly anytime, yeah
It's only one flight away, you can spend the night, yeah
I could treat you right, I swear I'll treat you right, yeah
You don't even try no more, just write me
I'm a private jet flying nigga, invite me
Sent you heart eyes but you never responded (never responded)
You never wrote back, but I seen you typing
You keep some lighters in your bag
Couple of grams in my lap and we'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone, you're tired
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone

Another day gone, another day gone, mm, mm
I know you stay up in your bag
You got a couple of bands in your stash
But you feel like you're losing
Feel like you're losing your mind, so sad
Why is that?
Another day gone and you're tired
And you need love in your life, so you keep moving
Picking and choosing those guys
Out of your mind (so sad), another day's gone
You keep some lighters in your bag (uh-huh)
Couple of grams in my lap (yeah) and we'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone, you're tired
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone
