Song Name: Partna In Crime (P.I.C.)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Better run, better run
Faster than my gun
Woke up with money on my mind (Woke up with money on my mind)
No nine to five (No nine to five)
I think I'm 'bout to rob today (I think I'm 'bout to rob today)
I got that Nina on my side (On my side), partner in crime
Don't wanna have to blow ya brain (Don't wanna have to blow ya brain)
I love my main bitch and my side (I love my main bitch and my side)
They blow my line (They blow my line)
I told 'em both I need some space (I told 'em both I need some space)
Feel like Allah (Feel like Allah), I feel like God (I feel like God)
I wonder why (I wonder why)
These niggas say my name in vain (These niggas say my name in vain)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my gun
Faster than my gun (Yeah)
Blast at him for fun (Brrt)
Went from rags to rich as fuck
Bet the baddest bitch gon' suck some
Pull up on her, bet she suck some
Hit her and her friend, that's a plus one
I promise I came from nothin'
He ain't rappin', that nigga be bluffing
Draco came with a drum (Drum)
And that motherfucker got kick
Got it in the duffle, only way it's gon' fit
Still lookin' for the nigga who been leakin' my shit (Fah, fah)
Real niggas move in silence, if you 'bout it, keep it silent (Shh)
I got Dior on my visor 'cause the streets is gettin' hotter (Pff)
I can't sleep right now I'm grindin'
I been shinin', look at these diamonds
Hope lil' shawty don't take it personal
When I'm on bad timing (Take it personal)
Got a little bitch, she from Nevada
Shawty lil' Spanish like Pi√±a coladas
I woke, up told her, "Let's get this money"
A nigga done had too much vagina (Woo, woo, woo)
Woke up with money on my mind (Woke up with money on my mind)
No nine to five (No nine to five)
I think I'm 'bout to rob today (I think I'm 'bout to rob today)
I got that Nina on my side (On my side), partner in crime
Don't wanna have to blow ya brain (Don't wanna have to blow ya brain)
I love my main bitch and my side (I love my main bitch and my side)
They blow my line (They blow my line)
I told 'em both I need some space (I told 'em both I need some space)
Feel like Allah (Feel like Allah), I feel like God (I feel like God)
I wonder why (I wonder why)
These niggas say my name in vain (These niggas say my name in vain)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my gun
