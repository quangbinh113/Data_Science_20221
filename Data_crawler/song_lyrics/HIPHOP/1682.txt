Song Name: Purple Hearts
Mmm, tippy-toein' and I'm up walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit
My bitch know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church
I'd rather fast with you than fuck it up
Fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intentions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant
Hoes like, "When you not trippin'?"
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice and they'll bless you back
Tippy-toein' and I'm up walkin', mmh
Rollin' sevens, I ain't not ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talking, but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
If God be the source, then I am the plug talking
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah
How's love when it's heart to your soul?
But my nigga left his ass on the road
Gossipin' 'bout some shit you don't know
Oh, you hoe (yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure)
I hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now if it's love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you still gon' be a part of me, I love mine, love mine
(Love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform (I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon' judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain't never eat my ass
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That's why I'm anti everyone before this mask
Mmh, tippy-toein' and I'm up walkin', mmh
Rollin' sevens, I ain't not ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talking, but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
If the God be the source, then I am the plug talking
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah
Yo, yo, Telekinesis, I'm purifyin' these D speeches
While I'm cryin', I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim is light
It's known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talking
To the mind, it's God Cypher Divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world's in the Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension
God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standin' by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother's ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that nigga cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don't give a fuck about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head just for God's sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God's way
Tippy-toein' and I'm up walkin', mmh
Rollin' sevens, I ain't not ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talking, but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking
If God be the source, then I am the plug talking
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
