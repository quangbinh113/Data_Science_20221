Song Name: No Mop
(We got London on the track)
It's some hoes in my collection that I might love
Couple bitches that get freaky off the light drugs
She know I spoil her 'cause she keep the pussy tightened up
Spot a bad bitch, will pick 'em and she might fuck
Orange new Birkin bag out of Herm√©s
First time I fucked her, the pussy felt like a virgin
Get her toes done every week because it's urgent
Got the pussy bussin' like a Glock because I'm determined
Take you out to Saint-Barts with no panties on
Book another jet so I can fuck you on the way home
I ain't never worried about these bitches and what they on
I just chase the paper in every city, I don't stay long
Pick up 500 and I leave in the mornin'
I just might glass you up 'cause you a trophy
AP, Patek, Richard Mill, Rollie
She wanna ride me, in my chains
Hit it from the back, she tell me, "Don't stop"
Switch sides, say my name, toot it up, get on top
Pussy slide, no brakes, when I start, I don't stop
I'll be ready when you're ready
That pussy wet, I don't need no mop
I don't entertain, put you on a plane
Take you where you want to go, Maine to Spain
G63, she got the big truck
And I ain't trippin', she always make sure my dick sucked
I'ma do the big one every time if you on point
I'm tryin' to go all out, I ain't tryin' to fall out
Take you to H. Lorenzo, we can make a mall house
Pull up at the spot, knock, and then I knock you walls down
She wanna ride me, in my chains
Hit it from the back, she tell me, "Don't stop"
Switch sides, say my name, toot it up, get on top
Pussy slide, no brakes, when I start, I don't stop
I'll be ready when you're ready
That pussy wet, I don't need no mop
She wanna ride me, in my chains
Hit it from the back, she tell me, "Don't stop"
Switch sides, say my name, toot it up, get on top
Pussy slide, no brakes, when I start, I don't stop
I'll be ready when you're ready
That pussy wet, I don't need no mop
