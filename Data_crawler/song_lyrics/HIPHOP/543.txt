Song Name: Pray 4 Love
That's real shit, bro, like
After you like a, a baby, a child, a little kid
If you lucky enough, you know what I'm sayin'?
After you a child, bruh, ain't no love in this shit, man, for real
This shit rough, man
You got a long road, boy, a cold one
Straight up
Only love what you do for 'em
The only kinda love out here, my nigga

Who can you trust in this cold, cold world? Better get a blanket
It's worse than the wild, wild west, this shit get dangerous
Never thought I'd see the day separate glitter from gold
When friends turn into foes, but it's the life that I chose
And these hoes look so heaven-sent, but be so devilish
Got spiteful ways, never seen it coming like a tidal wave
Get on my knees every day, I asked God and prayed
That my dirty ways don't lead me to an early grave
One life to live and it's survival of the fuckin' fittest
Here come your rivals, when you winnin', they want competition
And did I mention niggas itchin' to be opposition?
Hit they blocks with glocks with the extensions, now ain't no tension
Told my old lady how I'm feelin', she say I'm trippin'
But she don't know I pray for love
On the block with the thugs
Prayin' a nigga show us love, but ain't no love, so we get it out the mud
Mama made me feel like I overstayed my welcome
So I packed up my shit and went for seldom, like where's the fellas?
I'm pretty sure they understand the way I feel
Hotbox the bucket, laugh about how cold the world is
Like ain't no love in this shit 'til you get rich and famous
And these hoes want rappers or ball players
It's hard to separate the fake, 'cause they chose us
Everybody showed up when we blowed up
(And that's real shit, you know what I'm sayin')
I pray for, uh, I pray for love (And you wonder why I question everything, man), yeah
(Every female in my life, I'm talking 'bout everything, bro, it wasn't no love in this shit)
I pray for love (It's cold, real cold, you know what I'm sayin')
I pray for love, yeah, yeah, yeah (That's it, no love in this shit)
(Tellin' you, ain't no love in this shit, dawg) Aha, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (When you succeed, that's the only love out here, my nigga)
(This shit cold, bruh, for real, that's why)
I pray for love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ain't no love out here for us, I'm telling you, straight up)
(Tre made this beat)
