Song Name: Get Ugly
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob
It can get ugly (huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle
Yeah, bankroll gettin' bigger (nigga)
Empire gettin' built up, givin' racks to the right nigga
I can get a pack overnight, ain't nothin' like you niggas
Sippin' syrup 'til my body numb, I ain't tryna catch no feelings
I ain't never bite no nigga
She give me brain now 'cause I'm famous
I got these chains on, gettin' tangled
I'm in the big Benz, not a Wrangler
It's still a Jeep though, it ain't cheap, ho
I'm just happy they gon' free Rico
Dodgin' stank hoes and R.I.C.O.
I'ma spin a van with them Dracos
Probably ridin' around with Starlito
I'ma bust it down with my lil' bros
Buy cars for all of my kinfolk
If the sack ever did get low
God knows it's gon' be a robbery
Why the fuck everybody callin' me?
Everybody who left took a part of me
Excuse my drip, yeah, pardon me
Show me a list of who hard as me
It can get ugly (huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle (yeah)
Right back after tour, ain't got time for no attitude
Why I cannot lose, feel like I had to do it
I'm in my savage mood, put a lil' back into it
Treat me with gratitude, I ain't no average dude
Need my rims offset like Cardi B
This might be my hardest beat
Put the blame on Pee, he started me
Got the game from Big, he guarded me
Coach threw me in, took me out the streets
Now I get racks to rap on beats
I still know plugs with packs for cheap
Killers owe favors, they'll whack for free
Never did fraud, I got cash receipts
Lotta niggas get they swag from me
Don't tell nobody 'bout bags from me
You were not in the street, you wouldn't last a week
My bitch so bad, I pass on freaks
I'm here 'cause my granny be prayin' for me
None of these niggas ain't playin' with me
Got hitters that'll sit in that can for me, yeah
It can get ugly (huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle, yeah
