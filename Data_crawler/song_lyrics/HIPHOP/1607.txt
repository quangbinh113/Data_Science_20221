Song Name: Move On - Bonus
Lil Tjay
Oh my God, is that Avery?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Back when I met you I thought you were special
Something 'bout you, just couldn't forget you
Swear to God, I regret how you played me
Can't believe I was me and I let you
Bet you gon' miss all them nights when I sext you
Bet you gon' miss when I'm hard to get next to
Bet you gon' miss all them roses and petals
Where you gon' look when you ready to settle?
Never my way, lil' shorty I'm gone
This ain't gon' work, we ain't gettin' along
I can't sit right with you doing me wrong
I know it's gon' hurt when you hear this song
'Cause you've been playing games
And I been feeling strange
Girl, I don't want you to think I wanna change
I will move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on, oh
Move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on
Oh, I gotta go, 2020 now, you should see I'm changin' shit
Growin' up and I'm the man, yeah
To these bands, I got time to change a bitch
I think I want me a Bentley
Foreign car just to change the whip
They like, "Tjay, you different"
I tell 'em, I know
I'm focused, I'm changin' shit
Focused, ain't playin' no games with this
Car cruise, I got lane assist
Hop in the stu' and start flamin' shit
Got out them trenches, they dangerous, they dangerous, no
I was gon' ride for you
And it would be too much just to lie to you
So, I'ma just keep it a buck
You're out of luck if you think me sayin' I'm goin' is a bluff
I'ma leave, sit down, sit and breathe
I need your bad energy apart from me
I know Smelly up guarding me
Somethin' told me you ain't smart for me, no
Back when I met you I thought you were special
Something 'bout you, just couldn't forget you
Swear to God, I regret how you played me
Can't believe I was me and I let you
Bet you gon' miss all them nights when I sext you
Bet you gon' miss when I'm hard to get next to
Bet you gon' miss all those roses and petals
Where you gon' look when you ready to settle?
Never my way, little shorty I'm gone
This ain't gon' work, we ain't gettin' along
I can't sit right with you doing me wrong
I know it's gon' hurt when you hear this song
'Cause you've been playing games
And I been feeling strange
Girl, I don't want you to think I wanna change
I will move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on, oh
Move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on

Move on, move on, move on
Move on, move on, move on
Move on, move on, move on, move on, move on, move on
