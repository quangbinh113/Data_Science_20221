Song Name: Welcome To The Riches (feat. Lil Baby)
Blrrrd (yeah), blrrrd, big blrrrd (blrrrd)
Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd (blrrrd)
Got switches, slimey dude, I don't give a fuck (yeah, yeah)
Blrrrd, big slimey dude
No, I don't give a fuck (nope)
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd-blrrrd
Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd
Welcome to the riches, we got switches, move wrong, get hit up (for sure)
And can't nothin' come between me seein' this money
But a pair of buffs (nope, nope-nope)
You just consider me poured up
When I got wocky in my cup (yup, wock', wock'-wock')
I catch my man, won't walk away until I know he can't get up (blrrrd)
You still ain't heard about that slimey man? Lil' dude don't give a fuck (-give a fuck)
And we turn opp block to Afghanistan, quick to get suited up (suited up)
Yeah, both of them two niggas dead (uh)
I told y'all that they new what's up (what's up)
Walk with a wobble, I got Talibans, my pockets 'bout to bust (blrrrd)
Ayy, fuck that shit, get back to business (huh?)
We hop out, shoot with precision (blrrrd)
Just go keep spinnin' the opp blocks (blrrrd)
And don't come back 'til you get dizzy (blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd-blrrrd)
We say no yap (nope), you say no kizzy
We both got Glocks, so hide your blicky
Chopper in my lap, up, get to wiggin' (blrrrd)
I slam on everybody, Ben Simmons (yup)
I'm dripped in fashion, still sayin' it
Just left a 20-ball in Lenox
I get a call sayin', "What you in?" (Huh)
I give a call, they shootin' up in it (blrrrd-blrrrd)
Want some new guns, but got too many
Lookin' for some, shoot 'til infinity
Know I love my Draco the most
We got a hundred percent chemistry (yeah)
Welcome to the riches, we got switches (blrrrd), move wrong, get hit up (blrrrd)
And can't nothin' come between me seein' this money but a pair of buffs (yeah)
You just consider me poured up when I got Wocky in my cup
I catch my man, won't walk away until I know he can't get up (nope, nope)
You still ain't heard about that slimey man? (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Lil' dude don't give a fuck (nope)
And we turn opp block to Afghanistan
Quick to get suited up (blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd-blrrrd)
Yeah, both of them two niggas dead, I told y'all that they new what's up (what's up)
Walk with a wobble, I got Talibans, my pockets 'bout to bust
(Hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, Shiesty)
That money callin', I been stackin' paper, I ain't never fallin' off
Once the smoke go up, it's never comin' down
All these bitches wanna make a comment now
I went 30 clip, I need a lot of rounds
He ain't solid, that's why he is not around
Prolly somewhere tryna knock a thousand pounds
Dior, my jacket, they try rappers, I'm keepin' my ratchet
This shit crazy, I talk to my car
You can't pull up, I'm sparked at the door, we ready for war
And ain't no more play time, I'm for real
I'm in that mode now, watch me feel it
Give 'em a ten piece, he gon' eat 'em
I'm doin' donuts in a Demon (Demon, straight up)
Welcome to the riches, we got switches (blrrrd), move wrong, get hit up (blrrrd)
And can't nothin' come between me seein' this money but a pair of buffs (yeah)
You just consider me poured up when I got Wocky in my cup
I catch my man, won't walk away until I know he can't get up (nope, nope)
You still ain't heard about that slimey man? (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Lil' dude don't give a fuck (nope)
And we turn opp block to Afghanistan
Quick to get suited up (blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd-blrrrd)
Yeah, both of them two niggas dead, I told y'all that they new what's up (what's up)
Walk with a wobble, I got Talibans, my pockets 'bout to bust
Yeah, yeah, my pockets too overstuffed
Yeah, blrrrd-blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd
