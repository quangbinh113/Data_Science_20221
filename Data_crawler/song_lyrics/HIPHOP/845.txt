Song Name: RAPSTAR
Shout out my nigga Synco
(Tuned up) Uh
Copped a BMW
New deposit, I picked up another bag like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flying, crowds screaming, money counters, chains clanging
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winning
I ain't joking, do it sound like I'm kidding?
I've been making like 2000 a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimming
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a hoe, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winning, clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately, I've been praying, God, I wonder, can you hear me?
Thinking 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been sticking to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been getting high to hide behind my insecurities
Taking different pills but I know it ain't gon'...
Uh, copped a BMW
New deposit, I picked up another bag like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flying, crowds screaming, money counters, chains clanging
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winning
I ain't joking, do it sound like I'm kidding?
I've been making like 2000 a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimming
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (uh-uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished
They say I'm 'Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Weren't put in them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Looking for some' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killing me, I just want to leave earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Looking so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, uh
Shut the fuck-, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW
New deposit, I picked up another bag like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flying, crowds screaming, money counters, chains clanging
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winning
I ain't joking, do it sound like I'm kidding?
I've been making like 2000 a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimming
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
When I'm finished, when I'm finished
