Song Name: Go Off (with Lil Uzi Vert, Quavo & Travis Scott)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more ride (ride) one more race (ride)
We go all out, we don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'ma go off (yeah) I'ma ride tonight (yeah)
It don't matter what we face
I'ma go off (I'ma ride tonight)
I'm the master of my fate
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I gotta go now
Taking off and I'm riding on the road now
Hit the gas, no brakes, gotta go now
Put my life on the line, yeah it's on me
Blood rushing through my veins, no IV
Ride, switching lanes, you can't stop me
You can smell the propane when you pass me (propane)
Ride for the gang because I'm the chief (gang gang)
Helicopter hovering, it's high speed
Chase, drive, straight
I'mma, race, to the, cake
Flame, on it, no chain, on me
All of, us, became, homies
One more ride (ride) one more race (race)
We go all out, we don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'ma go off (yeah) I'ma ride tonight (yeah)
It don't matter what we face
I'ma go off (I'ma ride tonight)
I'm the master of my fate
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I gotta go now
Nine-nine, nine-nine (yeah)
You're rocking with the ether child in overdrive
Yeah yeah, I-5 to I-9
We go all niiiiight, yeah (straight up!)
Double 0 speed, double 0 Chevy
I hit the fourth gear, hope I don't drift
Souped up cars all around me
Hot-boxing at a high speed
One lane driving
Bad thing beside me
One more time on the road (it's lit)
One more time 'fore we go
One more ride (ride) one more race (race)
We go all out, we don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'ma go off (yeah) I'ma ride tonight (yeah)
It don't matter what we face
I'ma go off (I'ma ride tonight)
I'm the master of my fate
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I gotta go now
Gotta go now, gotta go
Swervin' in my whip can't slow down
Driving fancy cars, boy I'm on the road now
Automatic start, my Vic take a code now
Yeah, rockstar, heavy metal, no guitar
Why you pay so much for your Nissan? Because it's GTR
First I shift it, click it, burning rubber like I'm moving dark
Drive at night, I chop my top so I can relate to the stars
Yeah, relate to the stars
I'ma race you for a pink slip
I got nitrous in my car so tell me what you thinkin'
My adrenaline start pumpin' so I been stopped blinkin'
One more ride (ride) one more race (race)
We go all out, we don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'ma go off (yeah) I'ma ride tonight (yeah)
It don't matter what we face
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I'ma go off (I'ma go off)
I gotta go now
