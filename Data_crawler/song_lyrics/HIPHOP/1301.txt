Song Name: Nights
'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal

Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you, (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a s√©ance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first, always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani, nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up, ahh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
You know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, the everyday shit
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't want to die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit, that's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, my everyday shit
(Every night shit)
(Night shit, night shit, night shit)
All my night
Been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night
You been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self-made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment, out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yah, yah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't want to die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out, that's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, my everyday shit
My everyday shit, my everyday shit
My everyday shit, my everyday shit
My every night shit
