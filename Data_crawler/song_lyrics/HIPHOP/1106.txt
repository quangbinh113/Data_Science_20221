Song Name: Made A Way
I gave her diamonds and minks
I keep on spilling my drink
I fucked her over the sink
This the way, this the way
Shoutout to trenches at least
I feel in love when it's deep
I'm from the mud, that's the streets
Make a way, made a way
I drove my Lamb' with no license
I'm steady duckin' indictments
A million cash and diamonds
Made a way, made a way
Made a way, made a way
Why this bitch keep teasing me, she told me take my pants off
I'm the type of nigga to turn her up and turn her friends up
I don't need no tally, I could do this at my mans house
Best believe she definitely don't see my gun when I take my pants down
Junky with the drugs, I bought some perkies through my Cash App
Got it out the mud, the niggas I love didn't give me a hand out
I can't wait for you
I used to serve on all my schools, I made a major amount of loot
Pour me lean ain't drinking brew
I done made it out the mud, I'm with my gang, I don't recruit
Ain't gon' never see my clubbing, bring my hoes to the stu'
Ain't never gon' see me shopping, I bring the stores to the stu'
When you see me with my Glock, I'm like Cole Bennett when I shoot
One time
For the real bitches getting to the bag
One time
For them niggas who ain't stingy with the bag
One time
For the niggas that kept it silent in the fed
One time
For that nigga, tried to rob me but he dead
I gave her diamonds and minks
I keep on spilling my drink
I fucked her over the sink
This the way, this the way
Shoutout the trenches, my peeps
I'm sippin' mud like tea
I feel the love from the streets
Made a way, made a way
I drove my Lamb' with no license
I'm steady duckin' indictments
A million cash and diamonds
Made a way, made a way
Made a way, made a way
I gave her cash and a mink
I fuck her over the sink
I keep on spilling my drink
That's the way, that's the way
Shoutout the trenches, my peeps
I'm sippin' mud like tea
I feel the love from the streets
Made a way, made a way
Give her diamond baguettes
Everytime we fuck, break a sweat
I gave a bad bitch my blessings
Made a way, made a way
Said a prayer for my partners who be trappin' to the screen
I got racks out my bag 'cause I couldn't fit them in my jeans
I'm taking up the score, 'bout my team
By all means
Made a way, made a way, made a-
Got so much money, had to stay up for a week
Smash on this one with long hair, down to her feet
Shorty pop pills with me, shorty drinkin' (?)
Swerving through the fields, got that draco on the seat
I done seen a lot go wrong, turn bad
Turn your pain into champagne before I go back
I gave her diamonds and minks
I keep on spilling my drink
I fucked her over the sink
This the way, this the way
Shoutout the trenches, my peeps
I'm sippin' mud like tea
I feel the love from the streets
Made a way, made a way
I drove my Lamb' with no license
I'm steady duckin' indictments
A million cash and diamonds
Made a way, made a way
Made a way, made a way
