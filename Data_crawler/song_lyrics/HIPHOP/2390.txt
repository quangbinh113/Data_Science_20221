Song Name: BAD NEWS
Blacked out high the other night, last
Maybe, come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim
Might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out
If I hear the text, mmm
Know you probably blacked out high the other night, last
Maybe, come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim
Might've missed you
Know you probably
Blacked out, get the bag now
Where the address, where's he at now?
Don't let me back there
Might that be regicide, that's if I'm ever gone
If you pop me in my face, please spare the better side
Tabs out in my hands, only for one time
Let her go, I'm trying, the worst, oh
Let her go, let her go
She'll be running back, sell her soul
I'll buy it, nothing to worry about
Eighteen days until she blows
Said I'll pass, see the
Ain't she great, ride in the rove
In the car, stop, changing lanes
Fill the cup, 'till my heart drop, changing lanes
Fill the cup, say
Blacked out high the other night, last
Maybe, come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim
Might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out
If I hear the text, mmm
Know you probably blacked out high the other night, last
Maybe, come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim
Might've missed you
Know your probably, addy'd up (ooh)
Addy'd up
What I like is, never enough
Barely a time that I could share with others
Bought a new table just to skip supper
And all of my demons in bed, what you call it?
I left all of my demons on read, not a problem, mm
Wake up, wake up, barely a time that
Blacked out high the other night, last
Maybe, come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim
Might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out
If I hear the text, mmm
Know you probably
