Song Name: Get Your Roll On
Ooh, what, what, what, ooh, yeah

I fuck these hoes after our shows
Big dicks we slang, freak bitch, do ya thang
(Do yo thang)
Benz, Vest, Hummers, Jets
Rolex, Mosettes, television head rest
Twenty inches, nothin' less
Everyday iced out
Nigga play lights out
M period fresh hammer
Yo wife is my baby mama
Goddamn motherfucker
She's uh, good dick sucker
What the fuck, hold on everybody
Get yo' roll on
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Beatrice, bitch please
You know who I be
Nothin' else, none other
The number one stunner
Nigga I pimp hoes
Fuck toss, flip hoes
Show them bitches no love
Ridin' two G lacs on dubs
Ounces, quarters, halves, bricks
Nigga I done sold all that shit
As soon as my tour stop
Bought five Bentley Zoras props
TV's must, buttons must
CMB, platinum plus
What the fuck, hold on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin roll on
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
I like loud pipes, big rims, mo' ice
V-twelves or better
No, it's strictly leather
Play station DVD's
Don't worry about yo' bitch
She comin' wit' me
Leavin' stickers on the Bentley
To show the price
Arm out the windows
Just to floss my ice
Fresh, wait, hold up
That's that bitch we fucked
Nigga what yo' bank 'bout
Dog I've been lost count
Pop that Kriss, pop that moe
Slam that bitch, punch that hoe
What the fuck, hold on
Everybody get your motherfuckin' roll on
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
Everybody get your roll on
Everybody getcha motherfuckin' roll on, what
What, what, what, what...
