Song Name: You (feat. Travis Scott)
It's early
You couldn't get any better, baby (ooh, ooh)
Your lips taste like candy cane, do tell (oh, oh, oh)
You're my baby (yeah)
So amazing, when I'm going with it
Houston baby, think of it
Like a candy way or different (yeah)
You talk to me dirty, I'm talkin' back like a reflex (oh-oh)
I know you love to play games (oh-oh), but it ain't no recess
Around my town, they know my name (ah, ah, ah), I put it on Jesus
I booked your plane, to come my way
I got on me checks
Starrin' in my musical, without no feature
Do me a favor (do me a favor), and call a nigga back (a nigga)
I can't contain ya (I can't contain)
'Cause you've been in your bag (you been in your)
And hop in your safe (hop in your)
I'll make sure that you're bad (oh, oh)
You ain't different, I'll make sure you know that you're mine
I, baby, don't lie (oh, oh)
You ain't doin' alright
You ain't different, you, oh-oh, oh
You ain't different, think of throwing back
Back, back (woo)
You ain't doin' alright (back)
You ain't different, you, oh-oh
Before I break up out this place, take a eighth, and levitate
A lil' brown skin hurricane, a bay-bay, bring the wave
TBA for the time and the space, lock the day
Know you like to coordinate
Know it's good, see the hood in your face
Know you like to ride the wood, wanna see you do it like we in the H
Body good, body great
Below the waist, real estate
Know you like to ride the wood, wanna see you do it like we in the H
Please, don't make me think of it
Like you can't wait a difference (difference, difference)
You talk to me dirty, I'm talking back like a reflex
I know you love to play games, but it ain't no recess (recess, recess)
Around my town, they knowin' my name, I put it on Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
