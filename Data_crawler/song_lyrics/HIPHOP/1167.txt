Song Name: Suicide (with Lil Tjay)
Reapyy
(Haze, call me back)
Uh-uh-uh, uh (ayo, Shoki, this go-)
My mama told me, "Fuck a friend, they be choosin' sides"
Hate to admit it, but it turns out that you was right
Fuck the police 'cause they act like e'rythin' we do a crime
Free all my niggas up the road, yeah, there's doin' time
I'm in the trenches with the goons who be shootin' pipes
They flip this bitch and every tool gon' get utilized
Ayy, don't you know that tryin' us is suicide?
Ayy, listen, don't you know that tryin' us, that's suicide?
We don't play shit ain't allowed
Disrespect, I bet .40 go, "Baow"
Been a minute, ain't drop in a while
But somethin' keep tellin' me, "Fuck them, play foul"
Youngin' just 20, richest in my city
Made it this far and I stuck to the vow
I ain't changin' for nothin', they see how I'm comin'
I got here myself, they like, "How?"
I was hungry, out there tryna eat
Hit the studio, it's pockets of loud
Now it's Fogo for lunch with the Ch√£o
Wake up the chef and that shit throwin' down
Young nigga lavish livin', but I'm savage driven
I done ran it up way more than miles
Get the fuck out my face with them smiles
You don't want beef, then boy, you better bow
Young nigga, treacherous how I move, it's my style
If you interested lookin', don't think about bookin'
Just know ain't no pattin' me down
Know the police be watchin' my moves
In too deep, I can't turn it around
'Cause it keepin', I'm takin' that risk
I know niggas pray to see me in the ground
Uh, my mama told me, "Fuck a friend, they be choosin' sides"
Hate to admit it, but it turns out that you was right
Fuck the police 'cause they act like everythin' we do a crime
Free all my niggas up the road, yeah, there's doin' time
I'm in the trenches with the goons who be shootin' pipes
They flip this bitch and every tool gon' get utilized
Ayy, don't you know that tryin' us is suicide?
Ayy, listen, don't you know that tryin' us, that's suicide?
For B Money, throwin' Bs, TTG, that be the mafia
R.I.P. to 3, if he was alive, he would've shot at ya
My lil' shorty T, he gon' squeeze and lift that chopper up
Ten thousand degrees, so I can't see a team that's hot as us
Slide, slide, foenem up them beams, we gon' dot 'em up
Five guys, if you want that beef, we gon' chop it up
Hoodies on like Assassin's Creed, we keep Glocks with us
Grippin' chrome like that's all I need to get the opps to flux
Empty promises, it's like I'm starin' at a blank note
How my block get rich? That come from chasin' them pesos
Don't do politics, I only hang with my Draco
We start poppin' shit, you know I can't go, I can't go
My mama told me, "Fuck a friend, they be choosin' sides"
Hate to admit it, but it turns out that you was right
Fuck the police 'cause they act like everythin' we do a crime
Free all my niggas up the road, yeah, there's doin' time
I'm in the trenches with the goons who be shootin' pipes
They flip this bitch and every tool gon' get utilized
Ayy, don't you know that tryin' us is suicide?
Ayy, listen, don't you know that tryin' us, that's suicide?
