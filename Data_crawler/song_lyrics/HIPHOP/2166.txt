Song Name: Bye Bye
Alright, Mello made it right
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh my, get out my life
She said, "Why?"
(Mello made it right)
I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
(Uh) bye-bye, bye-bye
Um, see you later
(Uh) girl, I got a question for you
Yeah, I need a favor
Turn yourself back to a demon, I'm a demon slayer
Hell-proof to the core, take me to your lair
(Uh) hella persuasive
Hella curved animation, like The Matrix
Percocet, body achin', stomach achin'
Feel like it's a fuckin' earthquake where my brain is (huh, oh)
Hell's Kitchen blazing
Cookin' coke up for slave masters, bloody apron
I remember havin' a dream catcher, when I was like ten
Set that bitch on fire, all my dreams been comin' true since (been comin' true since)
Hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
(Uh) bye-bye, bye-bye
