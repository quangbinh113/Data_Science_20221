Song Name: 5% TINT
Who's that creeping through my window?
Before you come outside I got the info
Took her to the endzone from the the endzo
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more
Want to interject on you call for
All that out your new shit that ain't called for
Who that creepin' on the tennis guard 5%
All that fall in love shit she got it Kevin Hart (Kev)
All that speed and flash shit, we might teleport (skrr)
All that cop arrest shit I might might clip a sarge (twelve)
Keep bouncin' that ass you just might get a wart (yeah)
If she bad, she get a pass into the tour (passes yeah)
I've been through the family got a bad sister like Janey
I'm south-side don't panic
Got a switch, got a change no transit
Still jumpin' 'round move antsy
And I still don't like shit fancy
I been feelin' real trancy
They're outside they really tryin' to end me
Who's that creeping through my window?
Before you come outside I got the info
Took her to the endzone from the the endzo
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more
Want to interject on what you call for
All that out your new shit that ain't called for
Who the fuck is this?
That's somebody baby mama inside of the Benz
While I'm tryna tip
Shawty said she holding got a razor in her lip
Mix my cup and twist one up, I love that ratchet shit
She like "Iced out wrist, iced out, iced out wrist" (iced out wrist)
Fuck don't kiss, fuck she fuck don't kiss (muwah)
Look like friends, but she say they twins (twins)
Jump right in, there's leg room in this Benz (leg room in this Benz)
Ten miles to the crib you know that's deep (yeah)
I think there's someone out there that's watching me
Who's that creeping through my window?
Before you come outside I got the info
Took her to the end zone from the the endzo
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more
Want to interject on you call for
All that out your new shit that ain't called for
