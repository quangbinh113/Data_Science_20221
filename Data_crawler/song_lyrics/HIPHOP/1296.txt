Song Name: Surgery
She say that she love me, she dyin' to fuck me
I'm peepin' them sweats, she seatin' and up in 'em
Barely got bodies on the resumé, luckily
I'm fuckin' her good, I keep her good company
With her all day, she can't get enough of me
She say I'm her drug, she Hillary Duff-in' me
Swallow enough of my kids into custody
We havin' good times, we sippin' on bubbly
You said it was me but I promise it wasn't me
How you gon' switch up like all of a sudden-ly?
Like you told me, "Dolla, boy, look what you done to me"
Dickin' her out and and it feel just like surgery
Ooh, surgery, surgery, ooh, yeah
I'm dickin' her out, she thought it was surgery
Callin' on my phone for the dick, it's emergency
I be tryna kill it, it's a murder, it's a first-degree
Ass and the pussy good, yeah, yeah, certainly
I remember days, remember days, they was curvin' me, swervin' me
Now a nigga lit for eternity
Askin' what I like and how I feel internally
Bitch, I like my bandanas red and burgundy
Buy you a bag, it ain't nothin' but a purse
They say I'm in love, this ain't nothin' but some work
Walkin' through the house, ass hangin' out the shirt
No panties on in that 4HUNNID merch
Know it's on blast, I don't care if you the first
Fuckin' with me, prepare for the worst
Got it out the mud, baby, get ready for the dirt
But she fuck with me tough so she down to make it work
She say that she love me, she dyin' to fuck me
I'm peepin' them sweats, she seatin' and up in 'em
Barely got bodies on the resumé, luckily
I'm fuckin' her good, I keep her good company
With her all day, she can't get enough of me
She say I'm her drug, she Hillary Duff-in' me
Swallow enough of my kids into custody
We havin' good times, we sippin' on bubbly
You said it was me but I promise it wasn't me
How you gon' switch up like all of a sudden-ly?
Like you told me, "Dolla, boy, look what you done to me"
Dickin' her out and and it feel just like surgery
Ooh, surgery, surgery, ooh, yeah
(Uh) Pop bubbly, cup muddy
Bad shawty, I met her in public (Ah)
Ain't tryna cover, these bitches just love it (Nah)
Said she a freak but she really a-, uh, slutty (Slutty)
Dr. Miami got rid of the tummy
This Eliantte and not Avianne (Ice)
Made her a new bitch and got her new body
Upgrade the hottie (Upgrade the hottie)
Oh, oh, I gotta keep it one hunnid, oh (Oh)
Bought her some shit 'cause she honest, oh (Oh)
Bought a C8, it don't come with a
Uh, come with a roof (Come with a roof)
Matte triple black and the seats nice and blue
Tell 'em, "Bag back," led that bit' by the tooth (Bag)
Spend some more racks, someone said I was through
Muhfuckin' fool (Muhfuckin' fool)
Nah, we made a move, we like it true (Uh)
East side with goons
Ridin' in the Spyder, it like a coupe (Uh)
Bad bitch beside her, she smokin' ('Scotti)
Pass the biscotti, with the young nigga lit like a lighter (Lit)
We never care like a beat at a cypher (Yeah)
Ten racks inside, I'm just tryna entice her (Racks)
Everyone's excited
You said it was me but I promise it wasn't me
How you gon' switch up like all of a sudden-ly?
Like you told me, "Dolla, boy, look what you done to me"
Dickin' her out and and it feel just like surgery
Ooh, surgery, surgery, ooh, yeah
