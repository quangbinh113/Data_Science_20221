Song Name: Back Again (feat. Lil Durk)
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Blast his ass
I don't even ask when it come to cash, they catch him
Blast his ass
Jam get out that jam, I gave him 50, ain't gotta ask again
He was catchin' murders, way back then, that's when the MACs was in
I don't drink that red or that green, bring back the Act' again
Fucked her then she told that she hate me, now she back again
And you still alive, you better be lucky, ain't no traffickin'
Hate they ass so much, we dig 'em up and tell 'em, "Die again"
I can hit the club all by myself long as the strap is in
Niggas told me, all the rappers pussy, ain't no rapper then
They told 'em what type of car was in, I had to go get it wrapped again
Say when I get on, ain't no more thots, we fuckin' actresses
Bitch, you know we lyin', we fuckin' thotties on the mattresses
Hey, pop out like a ghost
They like, "Prince Dre, boy, he back again" (uh)
If a body movin', I spin back again, clap again (uh)
I be in the 'nois with a choppa like I'm Soulja Slim (uh, hey, hey)
O'Block they my brothers but 300 that's my woadie'nem
Them be my fucking partners
I be movin' through these bitch
Ain't worried 'bout no oppers (ain't worried 'bout no, ooh)
I'm a fuckin' shooter
And I'm dreaded like a rasta
I been runnin' up that bag, I been trappin' out that charger (skrrr)
Foenem screamin', "Get back"
You know I'm with that (uh)
Long live Baby Boy, but T-Roy can't forget Hec
Project baby, 6-4 shawty, got it on my back (uh)
Chopper bullet, make a somersault then put 'em on his back (boom, boom)
I ain't tryna squash no beef, nigga (squash no beef, nigga)
We into it 'til you die, real street nigga (real street nigga)
At yo' funeral, I might just slide, rest in pee, nigga (rest in pee, nigga)
Shoot up everybody that's outside
I bet Wooski feel this one (boom-boom, boom-boom)
I bet Wooski still twitchin' (damn, damn-damn)
He changed, somethin' different
I got clips like Mel Gibson (yeah)
All full, none of them empty (grrah, grrah)
I know niggas scared to come around when I pop out outside (I know it)
I done gave niggas whole head starts (what?)
Still I hawk 'em down (boom, boom)
That shit crazy (damn)
Krump was doin' all that woofin' and he ain't even make it (damn)
Melly got shot up in the party, started Harlem shakin' (damn, damn, damn)
If the pigs keep tweakin', I'ma start frying bacon (boom, boom)
The difference between me and you
Is you be askin', I be takin' (boom, boom, boom, boom-boom-boom-boom)
Blast his ass
I don't even ask when it come to cash, they catch him
Blast his ass
Jam get out that jam, I gave him 50, ain't gotta ask again
He was catchin' murders, way back then, that's when the MACs was in
I don't drink that red or that green, bring back the Act' again
Fucked her then she told that she hate me, now she back again
And you still alive, you better be lucky, ain't no traffickin'
Hate they ass so much, we dig 'em up and tell 'em, "Die again"
I can hit the club all by myself long as the strap is in
