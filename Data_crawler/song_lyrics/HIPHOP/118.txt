Song Name: ZEZE (feat. Travis Scott & Offset)
D.a. got that dope!
Ice water, turned Atlantic (freeze)
Nightcrawling in the Phantom (skrrt, skrrt)
Told them hoes that don't you panic
Took an island, flood the mansion (yeah, big water)
Dropped the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe you can stand in (it's lit)
See the bitches undercover (in the sheets)
I'm an ass and titties lover (big ass)
Guess we all made for each other
Now that all the dawgs free (yeah, yeah)
And we out in these streets (alright)
Can you do it, can you pop it for me?
Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit) (Offset!)
Blow the brains out the coupe (boo)
Police wanna talk, but I'm on mute (woo, woo, hey)
I'ma bust her wrist down 'cause she cute (ice)
Fuck her on a yacht, dive in a pool (yeah)
She an addict (addict)
Addict for the lifestyle and the Patek (Patek)
Big daddy, have you ever felt Chanel fabrics? (Chanel)
I be drippin' to death, I need a casket (drippin')
And we got more stripes than the ref, he foul, TEC him (bow, stripes)
In the middle of the field like David Beckham (field, bow-bow)
All my niggas locked up, for real
I'm tryna help 'em (free, free)
When I got a mil', got me the chills
Don't know what happened (hoo, chills)
Pop pills, do what you feel, I'm on that zombie (hey, hoo)
I'm more like Gaddafi, I'm not no Ghandi (Gaddafi, hey)
I'm more like I'm David, Goliath runnin' (hey, hey)
Niggas be clonin', I find it funny (clone, haha)
We from the Nawf, straight out of the dungeon
(We from the Nawf, hey)
I go in her mouth, she can't tell me nothin' (eghck, eghck, egchk)
300, the watch is out of your budget (woo, woo, 300)
Mean-muggin' got me clutching
Yeah, and this stick right out of Russia
Ice water, turned Atlantic (freeze)
Nightcrawling in the Phantom (skrrt, skrrt)
Told them hoes that don't you panic
Took an island, flood the mansion (yeah, big water)
Dropped the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe you can stand in (it's lit)
See the bitches undercover (in the sheets)
I'm an ass and titties lover (big ass)
Guess we all made for each other
Now that all the dawgs free (yeah, yeah)
And we out in these streets (alright)
Can you do it, can you pop it for me?
Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
Pull up in a demon, on God (On God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick
You know what I'm doing
If the police get behind me, I'm fleeing and eluding
Sleeping on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jacking
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seat lock
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money busting out my jeans like I do the scheme
Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
