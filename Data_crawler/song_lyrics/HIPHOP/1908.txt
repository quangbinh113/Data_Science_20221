Song Name: Livin' It Up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where all my
Uh, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, uh
To all my ladies that be livin' it up, uh
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say...
To all my ladies that be livin' it up, ah
C'mon, baby
This ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma love you tonight thing
Love, callin' your name, put your phone in the Range
And roll-over, I just really wanted to hold ya
In time get to know ya, that's a good chick
Before it's all over, I'ma meet this chick
Probably treat this chick more better
'Cause if you ain't know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar, partna, who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
And the mug and the watch, ugly
Half of y'all hate me, half of y'all love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky
You think I've got time to blow all this dough
And do all these shows?
Or flight in thellama chargin' white Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode
Do I do?
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
My love's for you
Ladies, just wanna hold a name Miss Atkins
That's why they show love with more passion than average
And I ain't mad at ya, never leave you alone
'Cause it's on when I'm home like it's on when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus we hit it off like first sight like "Love Jones"
Been, in many zones, baby, love it or hate it
From, prissy women to women who go to shadows
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
They got all of y'all givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Doing doughnuts and cuts then I open it up
On the freeway, hair on her wheel, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up
Do I do?
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
My love's for you
C'mon, we get right
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, we get right
Live yo' life
Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like a silent ecstacy
'Cause ain't nuthin' but an Inc thing baby
I know the world is going crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
Homegirl got a little uptight, turned off the light
And started crashing
The radio blastin' "Between Me and You"
But you ain't on the low with the freaky thing you do
I thought you knew (what I do)
You know I know (what you do)
'Cause it ain't a good night, if you don't act right
Like Teddy P, let's turn off the lights
And grind it out, takin' no times out
'Til the sun come out lemme find out
Do I do?
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
My love's for you
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin' it up, uh
My love's for you
C'mon, we get right
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, we get right
It's my time
Rule baby
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Do a roll
Do I do?
Low key
We out, we out
