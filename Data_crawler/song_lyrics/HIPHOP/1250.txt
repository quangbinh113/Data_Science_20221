Song Name: Run It Up (feat. Offset & Moneybagg Yo)
I just like the sound of it
Grr, ooh, ooh, boom
Grr, boom
Y'all do not know me, I shoot like I'm Kobe
That boy really tough on his doley though
I keep a Drac', ain't no OVO
I ain't for nothing, just check my portfolio
Really come from a block where they bang, bang
Protect' that Glock, oh, this Glock ain't no goalie, bro
Say you 'bout what you claim and then show me though
One in the head, you gon' die tryna toe to toe
Trench kid, no fucks, gotta run it up
If you thinkin' I'ma lose then you dumb as fuck
Pop out, drippin' diamonds, ooh, Bentley butter cup
Youngest out my city, keep it smooth just to sum it up
No security, you see me but that Glock spit
Youngest nigga doin' it, that's why I pop shit
VVS's drippin' water, it's like a mosh pit
Really not shit but I'm movin' like I'm hot shit
Legal money comin' in, I started off robbin'
True to everything I did, there's really no flagin'
All my shit been goin' up, lil' nigga, no dodgin'
And I'ma keep on comin' with the heat, I'm hoggin'
Trench kid, glitter on the piece, stop sobbin'
Why them niggas hatin'? It defeats my noggin
If that ain't really your beef, stop sidin'
Say you tryna run in these streets, stop hidin', huh
Run it up, run it up, run it up (run it up)
Niggas broke 'cause they be on that funny stuff (broke)
Richard Mille, my wrist be on- (ooh)
I done came way too far, I can't fuck it up
I got niggas that die by the gang, gang (gang)
Stupid, be honest, you fuck with us (hey)
Hearin' no one can slide, I be clutchin' up (bah)
Know the haters mad, they got enough of us (ooh)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (woo, woo)
Run it up, run it up, run it up (woo, woo, run it up)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up (oh)
I just stack up that money, I run it up (racks)
Give a fuck 'bout who love me, I run it up (ooh)
What the fuck they gon' tell me? My money up (woo, woo)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (woo, woo)
Double up (double), run it up
Lamborghini with the bubble guts (woo)
Got them bands and I'm flexin', hold my muscle up (flex)
I'ma stand on the business when it's time to fuck (stand on it)
I get paper in the morning when I'm wakin' up (wake up)
Make my bitch get your bitch, come and fuck on us (fuck on)
Make a hit with that switch, now my opps are dust (grrah)
Put my racks in a wad, I was growin' rust (racks)
Diamond chain get to swangin', they know it's us (woo)
They know it's me (know it's me)
Pinky ring get to singin' like Jodeci (woo)
Double R and it came with a notary (notary)
I see stars, I'm a star like it's 'posed to be (stars)
I pop bars, only way I can go to sleep (fall asleep)
When my gang needed me, bought a hunnid tees (gang)
Put the Patek on, my wrist a masterpiece (Patek)
Put some diamonds on her and some double C (hey)
Fuck these niggas, I'm up (up)
Kickin' my shit like I won the World Cup (kick it)
Start from the tip, baby, suck (woo)
Beat that shit down, baby girl need a crutch (crutch)
Hunnids keep comin', you know that's a must
If you talkin' money then we can discuss (woo)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, uh, ooh
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I just stack up that money, I run it up
Give a fuck 'bout who love me, I run it up
What the fuck they gon' tell me? My money up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (go)
I been runnin' that money up, puttin' on (go)
Ain't no end to this trend, it's a marathon (go)
Different breed, I might bust down a herringbone (look)
Board a flight with them racks in my carry-on
Talkin' 'bout money, you know who to call (Bagg)
It look like a riot, I fucked up the mall (whoa)
She diggin', have me and my whole circle, boss (gang)
Gave me some top through my Ethika draws (uh)
Earrings 150, I'm thuggin', I'm hood
I lock the screw back and put erasers on 'em (ghetto)
Wide body Daytona, bending the corner
Them hitters ain't renters, the tag Arizona
Ain't get no diploma (no)
Shot dice for the J's
The freshest dude in the schoolhouse (turn up for)
You ain't gangster, you went, took the smooth route (been a hoe)
Ran it up, now my pockets look too stout
Never enough, man, I gotta go get some more
Sold enough gas to go buy me a Texaco (good petrol)
Now I'm on the charts, I'm runnin' up streams
My niggas still got what you need though (go)
Built my name from the ground, I ain't have no help (no)
It's just me versus me, beefin' with myself (bad)
It was time I woke 'em up, they overslept (get up)
Run it up, run it up, still ain't out of breath (go)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I just stack up that money, I run it up
Give a fuck 'bout who love me, I run it up
What the fuck they gon' tell me? My money up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
