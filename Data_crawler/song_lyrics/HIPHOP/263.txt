Song Name: Goddamn (feat. A Boogie wit da Hoodie)
D.A. got that dope!
Ahh
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama but today the day (Ahh)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friend say
Car, automatic, I don't whip it if it's average (Woo)
And my bitch got status and your bitch cause static
Goddamn and you niggas ain't worthy (Ha)
She gon kiss on my dick like a Hershey (Mwah)
Put it so deep, she like, baby don't hurt me (Go, go, go)
Fuckin' rappers and athletes, she need a jersey (Go, go, oh)
Always in the club, I can't love her 'cause she thirsty (No)
And I'm watching everything see them niggas lurking (Bow)
And she in the backroom working, working
Fucking on my lap and she cursing, cursing (Ayy)
Nigga like me, I don't show no mercy (No)
When it get wet, feel like I'm surfing
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friend say
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid
Slide to the left (Ayy), slide to the left (Ayy)
Take a lil' step ayy, slide to the left (Slide)
Slide to the right (Yeah), slide to the right (Uh)
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night (Woo)
Make a loyal bitch unloyal (Ah)
Tryin' to get up in my section, I don't know you (Be gone)
Ay, niggas that make diamonds, that's for you
Big platinum plaques but they ain't for you (Nah)
I'm a California nigga in a yellow Lamborghini (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
When I take off the top, take off your bikini (Aye)
She a lil' freak freak, let a nigga skeet skeet (Eh, eh)
Beat it like Billie Jean, then I say hee hee (Hee hee)
T-Raww Weezy, make it look easy
She gon' throw it back, I'ma catch it like a frisbee
Nigga like me, I don't show no mercy (No)
When they get wet feel like I'm surfing
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friend say
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid (Ayy)
Slide to the left (Ayy), slide to the left (Ayy)
Take a lil' step ayy, slide to the left (Slide)
Slide to the right (Yeah), slide to the right (Uh)
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night
Slide to the left, slide to the left
Take a lil' step ayy, slide to the left (Slide)
Slide to the right, slide to the right
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night
(Goddamn, goddamn)
