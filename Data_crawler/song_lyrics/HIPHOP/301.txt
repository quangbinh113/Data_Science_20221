Song Name: Patek Water (feat. Offset)
DY Krazy
Go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
Southside
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back
Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Philippe water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place your order
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Oh, you rockin' the prong set, 40 pointers (Yep)
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh yeah)
Chain give me headache, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys (Addys), we so lavish (Let's go)
Call me Young Gunna, Young Gunna
Young Gunna, a nigga just wait up (Wet up)
We don't got no time for these boys, just shut up and bet up
The Rollie on Ric Flair, my wrist is just wet up (Whoo)
The plug just called like "What up?", nigga don't let up (Let's go)
The diamonds are yellow the day, you gotta catch up, yeah
Money on the floor with these hoes
These niggas can't pose with us (Can't pose, no)
How the fuck you sound old, you never grown with us
Diamonds in the ear got big lil' nigga, I told you (They dripping wet)
Flood that pack in the city, then throw it at Strokers (Throw it at Strokers)
All these bitches diggin' with a golden shovel (They diggin')
Secret service, they taking me through the side door (Side, let's go)
And I promise I can thumb with a blindfold
Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Philippe water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place your order
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Oh, you rockin' the prong set, 40 pointers (Yep)
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh yeah)
Chain give me headache, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys (Addys), we so lavish (Let's go)
Uh, baguettes on the edge of my neck (Baguettes)
I never settle for less (Nah)
Ooh, put her on Perky and Act', I'ma just fuck and forget (Smash)
Uh, yeah, mansion it sit on the hill, after my last arrest (Woo, woo)
Uh, niggas out here in the field, don't need a mask or vest (Brrt, brrt)
Uh, back to back Lambos, repeat it
You like to run when it's heated (Run, back to back)
AR-15 with the coolant, just in case it get heated
Hop on the wave and drown
My mama been Cartier bracelet down (Mama)
Uh, face it down, dirty in my soda, I hate the brown (Uh)
Hold it down 'cause the plug is illegal
Ridin' 'round with a dub and a eagle (Brr)
I heard that money get evil
Prayin' to god to keep me from demons (God)
She lost in the vibe surrounded by stars
We got her sucking on semen (Ugh)
You gotta survive and sparing no lives
F&N pop at your beanie (Ayy)
Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Philippe water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place your order
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Oh, you rockin' the prong set, 40 pointers (Yep)
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh yeah)
Chain give me headache, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys (Addys), we so lavish (Let's go)
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We just wanna go snatch a nigga's sunroof
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back
