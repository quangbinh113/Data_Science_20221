Song Name: Box of Churches (feat. 21 Savage)
Mhm, mm, blrrrd-blrrrd (we choose to go to the Moon)
Blrrrd-blrrrd, blrrrd
Blrrrd, ayy, ayy, who want smoke? Tell him meet face-to-face
Remember back in 'leventh grade, I dirtied up my only K?
Get my round applause, in a couple months I done made a way
I'm why niggas dropped the Rollies and went to the Cartiers?
Know I'm a hood nigga, I mismatch designer with the Js
Though I'm still posted on the block, eat a box of Church's before a steak
Amiris and the Burberry trench coat, extend, I hide the Drac'
Backdoor gang, I'm king snake, still quick to bake your ass a cake
Blrrrd (blrrrd-blrrrd)
Might take this pussy chain, snap it up and go live with it
He try to buy it back, rob him again, my mind different
Know K-D gon' score for me, I gotta keep slime with me
I been up since 6:00, I done made forty racks 'fore 9:50
Just keep pourin' and rollin' up, watchin' the gang from the kitchen
Condo on the stadium, keep goin' up, we finally livin'
Stay up on your Ps and Qs around me, go get on the business
And keep it solid every situation, don't you go to squealin'
B-A-C-G, big Shiesty Gang, don't come around, this shit get sticky
His background check came back today, it said you got booked for your Blicky
Blrrrd, you got booked for your Blicky
Backstage, dab up for your Blicky
Blrrrd, ayy, ayy, who want smoke? Tell him meet face-to-face
Remember back in 'leventh grade, I dirtied up my only K?
Get my round applause, in a couple months I done made a way
I'm why niggas dropped the Rollies and went to the Cartiers?
Know I'm a hood nigga, I mismatch designer with the Js
Though I'm still posted on the block, eat a box of Church's before a stake
Amiris and the Burberry trench coat, extend, I hide the Drac'
Backdoor gang, I'm king snake, still quick to bake your ass a cake
Closin' the deal, got a stick in the briefcase (pussy) (blrrrd)
Rob me a rapper, sell the chain on eBay (pussy, pussy)
I don't wanna rap 'bout nothin' but gunplay (straight up, straight up)
Catch him at a light, we gonna leave him on a one-way (21, 21)
Big 4L, I'm the real big (real big)
Dealin' with the law, he a real pig (pussy)
I done fucked around, had a rubber in my pocket
Said, "I don't wanna hit raw", but I still did (on God)
Glennwood Road, where they kill shit (21)
Walk a nigga down with a Kel-Tec (21)
Nigga, ain't trust me with his strap
So he took the clip out, he a real bitch (pussy)
I'm from the six where they shiesty (pussy)
Leave your man brain on your right knee (pussy)
All these opps got whacked
I know they prayin' that the folks indict me (21)
Bitch, I'm a player, can't wipe me (never)
Never been a hoe, not even slightly
When I'm on the road, got a model who Skype me
If I get fucked up, shawty gon' write me (21)
Blrrrd, ayy, ayy, who want smoke? Tell him meet face-to-face
Remember back in 'leventh grade, I dirtied up my only K?
Get my round applause, in a couple months I done made a way
I'm why niggas dropped the Rollies and went to the Cartiers?
Know I'm a hood nigga, I mismatch designer with the Js
Though I'm still posted on the block, eat a box of Church's before a stake
Amiris and the Burberry trench coat, extend, I hide the Drac'
Backdoor gang, I'm king snake, still quick to bake your ass a cake
Blrrrd
