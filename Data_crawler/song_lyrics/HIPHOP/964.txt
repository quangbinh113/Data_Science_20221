Song Name: Letter to My Daughter
I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote
(Ayo, let me hear that KF)
Might be the realest shit I ever quote (you're so LayZ)
Yeah
Letter to my daughter (yeah, yeah)
I'm just tryna be your father (yeah)

Ayy
In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you can't enter with your shoes on
Finna cop a Rolls-Royce car seat for my newborn
Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home
Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms
Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you
She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you
Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you
Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough
All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf
But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat
Know that God and the universe be workin' for me
Seeing you growing up from afar tends to scare me
Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama
Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma
'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick
So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?
Please, no pity for a G
I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see
It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week
And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat
Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day
Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case
If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away
I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way
Ayy, I wanted a child, just to have something to live for
Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for
Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent
Feeling like I'm transparent, what I tell your grandparents?
I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps
Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths
Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death
Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left
Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers
You're nothing less than a goddess
You better not lower your standards
A nigga call you somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar
Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer
'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given
The feeling she might be calling him daddy
Got me the sickest, so I'm trippin'
If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm trippin'
Gotta separate my pride from my feelings
Please, no pity for a G
I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see
It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week
And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat
I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process
God give us challenges and see us make some progress
Ain't nothing from this situation I can say I regret
Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet
The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller
Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter
Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers
That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler
Read books until you go to sleep
Wake up, cook you something to eat
Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy
Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me
Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G
Tryin' to put me on child support, all the child need is support
Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford
Long-term relations from short-term greed
Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need
Such a big miracle in such a little girl
Never let them break your spirit in this physical world
'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl
And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls
Letter to my daughter
I'm just tryna be your father
Letter to my daughter
Please, no pity for a G
I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see
It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week
And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat
Please, no pity for a G
I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see
It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week
And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat
They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care
But more than anything, I'll always be there
I love you
