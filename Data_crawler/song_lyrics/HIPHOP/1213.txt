Song Name: rollercoastin
Rollercoastin'
Roller-roller, roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm
Roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm-mm, mm-mm
Rollercoastin', mmm, mm-mm
Ayy, hop off a jet, hop to a check
Get to the money, and then what's next?
I'm tryna pack out a gymnasium
Like yeah, if he was young
Had a porn star with the titties out, pussy out just for fun
She like to go down South, and her brain go dumb
How you say want a nigga life, but you can't carry no tongue?
That's why my dick inside her mouth, and I get buried in her tongue
'Cause you know that's what you need if you have a long day
If she don't go both ways, then she go the wrong way
I been holdin' down a culture, I cultivate
And it's really, really sad when I see it in your face
I think you rollercoastin'
Rollercoastin'

Roller-roller, roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm
Roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm-mm, mm-mm
Rollercoastin', mmm, mm-mm
Keep it rollin', rollin', rollin', keep it real as they come
Been up and down so many times, they got my nerves goin' numb
I got some niggas that go by, "Murder", why they sip red rum?
Red beams and green beams on the Glocks and all the K's
My lil' nigga ride with extended mops on all occasions
I ain't surprised by my baby mama, she don't amaze me
They try to paint a picture of a nigga like I'm Fugazi
And run to the internet every time she feel crazy
I try to pray to God, hopin' he will save me
I ain't never come this far not to take care of my baby
Gotta give my son my all, that's how my mama raised me
I gotta stay involved even though they tryna jade me
Rollercoastin'
Roller-roller, roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm
Roller-roller, roller-roller-rollercoastin', mm-mm, mm-mm
Rollercoastin', mmm, mm-mm
(Good mornin', boofy, I pray all is well with you)
(I'm prayin' that you have a prosperous concert tonight)
(Stay focused, know that your granny loves you)
(And I might not be there in the flesh, but I am there in the spirit)
(Love you, man, alright, talk to you soon)
