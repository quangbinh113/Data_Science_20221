Song Name: Enough
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two face promise
Scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough
Yeah, I had to walk away from all the lies
I think that it's time for me to rise
Again, yeah
Yeah, I can't believe I wasted all my time
Just to tell another one goodbye, my friend
You already walked that line
You crossed it many times
Yeah, you know how to get the best of me
You said you changed, you won't
I guess I should've known
You'll never get another chance with me
Yeah, like don't you think I've been through enough?
Baby, we've been falling in, out of love
You shot me down, yeah lost all my trust
Everything you promising is really a bluff
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two face promise
Scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough
Memories all in my head
I've been playing the same ones, been playing the same ones
Yeah, you gotta move on
Yeah, it's not gonna be the same it was once
The way it once was
It's time to leave
You gotta go
Just let me be
I'm on my own
I'm sick of you
And all your moods
And I ain't here to play no games, no
Yeah, like don't you think I've been through enough?
Baby, we've been falling in, out of love
You shot me down, yeah lost all my trust
Everything you promising is really a bluff
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two face promise
Scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop calling
You've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough
