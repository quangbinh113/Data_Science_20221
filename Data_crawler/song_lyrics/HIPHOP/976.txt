Song Name: FALL IN LOVE
Oh
(I thought I fell in love, but she just couldn't ever be for me)
Hmm (Yuh), keep it
(I thought I fell in love, but she just couldn't ever-, fuck)
Yeah, ayy (Stupid)
I thought I fell in love but she just couldn't ever be for me
(Haha, bitch)
The way she put her feels got me thinkin' she's the one for me (Fuck)
Just fall in love with me (Ayy)
And tell me everything is meant to be (Uh)
Please, let me know where I should go (Yeah)
Just fall in love with me, my rose
Woah, woah, woah (Oh)
You broke my heart so casually (Ayy)
Woah, woah, woah
This isn't where I want to be (Yeah)
Broken hearts and memories (Uh)
The reason for my tragedies (Haha)
I spilled my blood all on the ground (Yeah)
You hear it in my melodies (Yeah)
Confidence and vanity (Ayy)
I bring it in reality
I can't even fall asleep (Nah)
I think my demons after me
Woah, woah, woah (Uh)
This isn't where I want to be
Just fall in love with me
And tell me everything is meant to be (Ayy)
Please, let me know where I should go
Just fall in love with me, my rose
Woah, woah, woah
You broke my heart so casually
Woah, woah, woah
This isn't where I want to be
I fucked up
Look at this love
I cannot say
I think I'm hooked on
Look at this love
I cannot say
I think I'm hooked on
