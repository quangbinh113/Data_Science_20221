You went bought a plane ticket, but I chartered it
Tryna hit your main thing, let me borrow it
Sippin' Hi-Tech and I got a hot TEC

Fuck my best partner, make the bitch drop him (on God)
Never sold drugs, nigga, I'm a robber (yeah)
Lil' bitch bother, hit dawg, holler
Hit my first lick, went and bought a Marni collar (on God)
Gucci garments, kush smell like armpits
You domestic, all I ride is foreign shit
Sippin' Hi-Tech and I got a hot TEC
I got new money, it ain't even out yet
You went bought a plane ticket, but I chartered it
Tryna hit your main thing, let me borrow it
Sippin' Hi-Tech and I got a hot TEC
I got new money, it ain't even out yet
Gucci garments, kush smell like armpits
You domestic, all I ride is foreign shit
Sippin' Hi-Tech and I got a hot TEC
I got new money, it ain't even out yet
You went bought a plane ticket, but I chartered it
Tryna hit your main thing
Sippin' Hi-Tech and I got a hot TEC
I got new money, it ain't even out yet
