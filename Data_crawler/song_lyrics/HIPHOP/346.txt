Song Name: Big Rocks (Offset feat. Young Thug)
Wheezy outta here
Wheezy outta here
Big, big rocks on the frames (Big rocks)
We got stocks of the panes (Stocks)
Fuck her outta bangs (Smash)
SV, fuck her in the Range (SV)
Double C's on the buckle, she got rain (Double C's)
Courtesy, I put diamonds on the gang (Courtesy)
They know it's me when I'm walkin' in the bank (They know it's me)
150 on the Audemars, plain (Plain Jane)
Check my stain, I had roaches but I never complain
Blowed out the brain, on a bitch for the Audemars, plain
Fuck your domain, I was lookin' for a thottie to bling
Burn his remains, now he can't do it again
Woo, woo, Offset
Tip-toe, put your ho, like curb flow (Preach)
Headshot, what the fuck you got a vest for? (Bah)
I'ma hit her with the right and the left stroke (Hey)
She be eating' up the pipe, got the best throat (Pipe)
Bought a jet, I been cappin' in the West Coast (Phew)
I put five million dollars in the escrow (Five)
Diamonds hit, make the bitch break her neck, ho (Blind)
She obsessed with the drip, she can't let go (Drip)
White gold, rose gold Patek (Two tone)
Money in the dirt, and it's matted (Matted)
Wipe your nose with the ratchet (Slime)
Strip him out his clothes, gotta have it (Hey)
Touch screen cameras on the tablet (Doot, doot)
Maison Margiela, my fabric (Margiela)
Karats on me, where the rabbit? (Where?)
I save a hunnid a week, it's a habit (Hey)
Big, big rocks on the frames (Big rocks)
We got stocks of the panes (Stocks)
Fuck her outta bangs (Smash)
SV, fuck her in the Range (SV)
Double C's on the buckle, she got rain (Double C's)
Courtesy, I put diamonds on the gang (Courtesy)
They know it's me, when I'm walking in the bank (They know it's me)
150 on the Audemars, plain (Plain Jane)
Check my stain, I had roaches but I never complain
Blowed out the brain, on a bitch for the Audemars, plain
Fuck your domain, I was lookin' for a thottie to bling
Burn his remains, now he can't do it again
