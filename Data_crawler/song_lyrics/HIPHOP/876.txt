Song Name: Life's A Mess II (with Clever & Post Malone)
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody?
Not just somebody
No, no
Rex, you did it again
Have you fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world? Um
I really hope they held you down, I really hope it was no lyin'
'Cause when heart breaks, it feel like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one tryin'
You just gotta learn to live and love on
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
There's one that won't never leave you cold or place nothing above you
That will love a heart that hurts
Don't hurt the heart that loves you
Sometimes they just want what they can't have, forbidden fruit
But the one that deserves your love will never pick and choose
There was once a hole in my heart, that hole was hurting
'Til I took a peek inside, lately I've been soul searchin'
And I use to cry, I turned to medication
Then I found me something real and forgot all the imitations
Just tell me that you'll never leave
And when there's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway, ah
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
And I swear I would never leave you cold
There ain't no one above you
You were way too high to touch
I was high enough to pass out
When you was so alone, I was a stone's throw away
I remember those lips, I remember how they taste
I been staring at the wall, doing nothing all day
I remember everything, put the bottle to my face, Dom PÃ©
If you gave up on me now, I would seriously be so fucked up
I'm doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up
Never gave a fuck what they say 'bout us
Fuck all of you muh-fuckers slow me up
And fuck everything that ruined us
I'm three seconds away from pulling out my gun
