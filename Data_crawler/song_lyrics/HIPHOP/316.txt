Song Name: Elevatorz (feat. PnB Rock)
800 hertz
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Elevators
Sex you up and down, 'cause you heard I'm a entertainer
Good liquor, good weed, good vibes
Elevators on my mind
Up and down, a million times
Lovin' you
Lovin' you
Elevators
Word around town, you got good
Don't be no stranger
Up and down, just like a
Elevators on my mind
Up and down a million times
Lovin' you (ooh, ooh)
Lovin' you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh oh
Up and down, girl I love the way you ride it
Bust it down, but don't get me too excited
I go downtown when I'm hungry just to bite it
You like it, when I pull your hair, while I pipe it
Love it when I fuck you slow, so you feel it in your soul
Then you tell me speed it up, but that shit can't be smooth
Back shots, girl I give you back shots
Touch your toes
Neighbors gon' be knockin' at the door
The way you scream and moan
When I hit it, feel that pussy pop
I'm talkin' Amber Rose
The way I beat it up, got you on lock, ain't talkin' no parole
Kill that pussy, can't nobody save you
Up and down, like the elevator
Elevators
Word around town, you got good
Don't be no stranger
Up and down, just like a
Elevators on my mind
Up and down a million times
Lovin' you
Lovin' you
Elevated, dedicated
I'm feeling medicated
High in that pussy, cry in that pussy
I'm glad you made it
'Cause I was just 'fraid that you wouldn't make it
I thought you would change your mind
From that last conversation
When you was tellin' me
You were torn between the two
And I told you, that's your choice
And let you do what you gon' do
And you chose Bleu
Whoever knew you'd slide through the zoo?
When I was on the block, not worrying about the cops
And I had rocks in my socks
And I can't lie, the feelings mutual
I'm just tryna he neutral
Not do things that I used to do
Be quiet when I'm schoolin' you, yeah
Elevators
Ooh, elevators
Elevators
Word around town, you got good
Don't be no stranger
Up and down, just like a
Elevators on my mind
Up and down a million times
Lovin' you
Lovin' you
