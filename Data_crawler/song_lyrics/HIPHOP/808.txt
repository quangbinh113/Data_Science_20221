Song Name: 33
Yo, ayo
High off ecstasy and that codeine what I'm sippin' (What I'm sippin')
This new Glock got .33, Scottie Pippen (Scottie Pippen)
Bitch, all of my niggas bangin' C's
Like we Crippin' (Like we Crippin')
Girl, you got what I need, what I been missing (What I'm missing)
Let's take that chance, want you to see that I'm different (Oh)
Back then, tryna find myself
I couldn't believe how I was trippin' (Oh)
No neighbors in the mountains, palm trees
That's how I'm living (That's how I'm living)
Every time that I pop out
Bustdown VVs, designer drippin' (Designer drippin')
Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, when it get hot, they bring them TECs out
Better watch your back or you'll be on that corner stretched out
Quick to change a nigga standin' tall with his chest out
And they like headshots, it won't make sense to bring a vest out
Shit be devastatin', you find out your homie checked out
Parents lose control, don't know her daughter havin' sex now
Niggas hatin', I'm gettin' paper, that's what they pressed 'bout
Went down the wrong path, switched it up and chose the best route
I ain't used to have it all, I used to feel left out
'Member I was broke, ain't have a dollar, I was stressed out
Now I'm tryna get richer, like Blast, let's bring the jets out
Bitch, I need like ten bathrooms up in my next house
High off ecstasy and that codeine what I'm sippin'
This new Glock got .33, Scottie Pippen
Bitch, all of my niggas bangin' C's like we Crippin'
Girl, you got what I need, what I been missing
Let's take that chance, want you to see that I'm different
Back then, tryna find myself, I couldn't believe how I was trippin'
No neighbors in the mountains, palm trees, that's how I'm living
Every time that I pop out, bustdown VVs, designer drippin'
Got a baby .40 with a new extended clip inside
For any problem, bitch, it's .22 up in this clip of mine
My peoples lookin' up to me, so no, I can't be victimized
I got so much pent-up anger, I just wish a nigga tried
You gon' die before you blink, yeah, that's gon' be a quick demise
The world be so fucked up, that shit'll have you sick and tired
You can't even post a picture without being criticized
Was broke, but now I'm living everything I used to visualize
Thinking 'bout them stories, still don't make sense how my niggas died
That shit still haunt me to this day, them L's hurt a nigga pride
How both of the twins leave? Why one of them didn't survive?
Still want that point for Gucci, look his killer in his eyes
My bad I never scored for y'all, but at least a nigga tried
Walking through the opp shit with my Wesson, I couldn't get a ride
I gotta run through a check for every tear a nigga cried
Gon' make my mark up in this shit, make sure my spot solidified
High off ecstasy and that codeine what I'm sippin' (What I'm sippin')
This new Glock got .33, Scottie Pippen (Scottie Pippen)
Bitch, all of my niggas bangin' C's
Like we Crippin' (Like we Crippin')
Girl, you got what I need, what I been missing (What I'm missing)
Let's take that chance, want you to see that I'm different (Oh)
Back then, tryna find myself
I couldn't believe how I was trippin' (Oh)
No neighbors in the mountains, palm trees
That's how I'm living (That's how I'm living)
Every time that I pop out
Bustdown VVs, designer drippin' (Designer drippin')
