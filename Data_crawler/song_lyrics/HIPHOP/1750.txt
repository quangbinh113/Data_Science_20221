Song Name: Gravity
Fappy and ratchet, uh, uh
Fappy and ratchet, uh, uh
We are fappy and ratchet, uh, uh
We are fappy and ratchet, haha, uh, uh, yeah
Baby on that broke bitch shit (Broke bitch)
I be on that "Go get rich", get a bag, then I dip (Go, go)
He already know what it is (Uh)
If he make it back to the crib, then he gon' want a lick
Ayy, gravity, make it drop
Pick that shit up, make it stop
Look back at this shit like it's a lot
Ayy, gravity, make it drop, uh
If you got a problem, better say sum (Say sum)
No, you can not run up on me with my day-ones (Run it up)
We'll wet your back up with that spray-gun (Which one)
If it's beef it ain't no take-backs, no refunds
My body looking like a pornstar
Spent a hunnid-K on all what's on us, only got a mar, want to feel it?
My niggas round me, ain't nobody guards
When I hop out the coupe, yeah, I park it on the lot
Big racks, real chill, laid back
Black man on my nails like a Maybach
Heard they mad 'cause I stay up in a big bag
That mean that money in the walls is where I lay at
Baby on that broke bitch shit (Broke bitch)
I be on that "Go get rich", get a bag, then I dip (Go, go)
He already know what it is (Uh)
If he make it back to the crib, then he gon' want a lick
Ayy, gravity, make it drop
Pick that shit up, make it stop
Look back at this shit like it's a lot
Ayy, gravity, make it drop (Yes, bitch, yes)
So what it sound when my bitch throwing the rain?
I ain't got no ass, just be always out of town (Uh)
He stuck on that same old shit, move around (No)
He been having fun so I had to subtract it
He said he a boss but the math ain't matching (Ayy, uh)
Divide my bitches up and cross these hoes out like they fractions
Got no problem with no nigga, got a problem with no action
Big racks, real chill, laid back
Black man on my nails like a Maybach
Heard they mad 'cause I stay up in a big bag
That mean that money in the walls is where I lay at
Baby on that broke bitch shit (Broke bitch)
I be on that "Go get rich", get a bag, then I dip (Go, go)
He already know what it is (Uh)
If he make it back to the crib, then he gon' want a lick
Ayy, gravity, make it drop
Pick that shit up, make it stop
Look back at this shit like it's a lot
Ayy, gravity, make it drop, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
