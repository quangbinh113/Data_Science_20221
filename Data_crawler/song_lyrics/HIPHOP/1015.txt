Song Name: Merci Beaucoup
Woo (haha)
Wait
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry (bah)
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry, huh, wait (bah, woo)
Hahaha (hahaha)
Yeah, hol' on
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry (baow)
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Look, I said, "Don't get it twisted
Just 'cause I smile a lot, that don't mean I'm with the foolery" (bah)
When I walk in my school
All the staff "Woo" at me, I'm like, "You used to tutor me" (what?)
I stay in the cut like a Band-Aid (cut)
And that's where my shooters be (bah)
Run down, gun tucked, tool on me, tool on me (grrrt, woo)
Rah Swish, Pop Smoke (Pop Smoke), they do not know what you started
I pop a Perc', go retarded, then mack up the 'Rari
Then fuck in my grandma' department
I'm rockin' Louis V, Louis V (Louis V) 'cause I ain't too pressed with Dior
No telling, but I'm the Messiah, now I'm the creator
I got the drip in my pools
I can not never, I could never kiss a whore
Fuck her life up, then go up on tour, huh
She know we up on the board
I got the four-five tucked in my drawers
They like, "What's on your ring?" eleven Carats
That come with a bad bitch and a mansion and she from Paris
Merci beaucoup (merci beaucoup), I don't got nothin' to prove (nah)
It's either you win or you lose, it's either you win or you lose
And I'on't really care what your gang claim
All I know is my niggas is woo
Saucin', hol' on, woos, huh, I shoot a nigga out the coupe
Wait (woo, woo)
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry, wait (woo, woo)
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Cash
Wait
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry, wait (woo, woo)
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Catch a opp and I'm takin' his jewelry
Be in control of your own shit, of your own creations
Know what I'm sayin'? Like be a creator (wait)
Like, I feel, like, when you create your shit
When you know what you want, know what I mean? (Wait)
Don't let nobody get in between you and your creation
If you want somethin', it gotta be that (wait)
Make it 'cause you know it
Nobody can't tell you, know what I'm sayin'? (wait)
I wasn't thinkin' about the masses yet
I'm thinkin' 'bout my hood (wait)
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm like, "Nah, I got to drop another one for the hood"
As long as you ain't on no sucker shit, you'll be a'ight (wait)
You good, real niggas gonna vibe with real niggas
Know what I'm sayin'? You ain't woo, you ain't winnin' in this shit
