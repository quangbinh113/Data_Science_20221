Song Name: Prospect (ft. Lil Baby)
Hey
Smoke, woah, woah-oh
(Wheezy outta here)
Woah, woah-oh
(Ayy, KBeaZy, you fired up)
Yeah
Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to getting that cash
Addicted to popping them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch calling back
Saw me come up out of random
Didn't wait long, now that bitch throwin' tantrums
Her friends fell in love when I fell into fame
In my DM's, talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know that they hate me and want me for ransom
It's nothin' new, I won't give into that
I eat the hate up and spit it right back
My lyrics like bullets, I'm shooting your ass
Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the back
I'm a prospect, not from earth, I feel like a martian
Matter of fact, bitch, I came from a starship
My bed feel like a coffin, not wakin' up
If I run into opps, I'ma off 'em
I don't know if you think that you stoppin'
What I got goin' on, got a semi with auto on
This ain't no auto-correct, bitch, this a threat
Now I'm comin' at your neck
Niggas act cute like a pet
Soft like a Pop-Tart, act like they got no heart
Y'all be the ones that's pretending
Insecurities, they always offended
Mad about a bitch I already been in
That bitch for everybody, we ain't spoke in a minute
Niggas still in the picture and I'm still leavin' with her
It ain't nothin', I'm a rebel
I can't conform, I ain't fallin' back, no
She need more, she got too attached, ha
Addicted to me like I'm on one
Three thousand for that new Rick Owens
Walk around, look like a mummy
Psychedelics hurt my tummy
Swipe, swipe, I'ma get it all (yeah)
Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to getting that cash
Addicted to popping them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch calling back
Saw me come up out of random
Didn't wait long, now that bitch throwin' tantrums
Her friends fell in love when I fell under fame
In my DM's, talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know that they hate me and want me for ransom
It's nothin' new, I won't give into that
I eat the hate up and spit it right back
My lyrics like bullets, I'm shooting your ass
Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the bag
Brand new Corvette, come through smashin' the gas
They made me mad, now I'm back in my bag
I hope my main and my side never crash
Wide-body 'Cat, tryna dodge my past
We catch that boy, we robbin' his ass
It's the principle, I don't need the cash
Expensive bitches, half a million on lashes
I could kick it but I don't like to brag
Hoe, they done made me mad, I'm 'bout to turn up
I got my glizzy, wish a nigga run up
You can come get your bitch 'cause I don't want her
I ran my millions up from out the corner
I'm the one out here doin' what I wanna
My lil' bro ran it up off marijuana
Grind in the winter, turn up in the summer
Trackhawk with sport, I press it then I launch it
I'm thankin' God, ain't no more free lunches
Got suspended, me and greeny hundred
House up on the hill, I used to want it
Now I got it, I don't even stay there
I get even, I don't play fair
Probably spend me a million on haters
On they top, make 'em drop
And I don't give a fuck 'bout no cops
Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to getting that cash
Addicted to popping them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch calling back
Saw me come up out of random
Didn't wait long, now that bitch throwin' tantrums
Her friends fell in love when I fell under fame
In my DM's, talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know that they hate me and want me for ransom
It's nothin' new, I won't give into that
I eat the hate up and spit it right back
My lyrics like bullets, I'm shooting your ass
Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the bag (woo)
