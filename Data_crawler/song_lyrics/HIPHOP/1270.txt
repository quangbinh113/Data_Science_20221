Song Name: I might
Whoa-oh, whoa
Dior shades they cover my eyes
I'm with a shawty with a mouth full of lies
I do this to myself every time
I said I won't but I'm lit and I might
Hit your phone up girl, I know it's 3AM
Baby bring a friend
I'm lit and I might
Pour one up and then I roll a three again
Just to tweak again
I'm lit and I might, huh
I don't know why I do it
Around the ones that do it wrong, show me you're not loyal
Now here we go again, girl stop it
You're not making sense
Don't hit my line
You wanna link up, oh we do this every time
A different story 'bout some nigga in yo life
I don't wanna hear it
The wrong decision you make again
Here we go again
Why?
Always seem to cry
Lies
Dior shades they cover my eyes
I'm with a shawty with a mouth full of lies
I do this to myself every time
I said I won't but I'm lit and I might
Hit your phone up girl, I know it's 3AM
Baby bring a friend
I'm lit and I might
Pour one up and then I roll a three again
Just to tweak again
I'm lit and I might
3AM
Woah
Woah-oah-oah
Oh-woah
Woah-oah-oah-oah
