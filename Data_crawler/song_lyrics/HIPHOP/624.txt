Song Name: No Heart
Keep it Z3N
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
Feelings I just can't ignore
Heartbreaks, we been here times before
So baby, so long, so long
I'm not playing fair, playing fair
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
So baby, so long, so long
So heartless bitch, I hate you
I can't believe you did me
Your mama thought that we were gonna last
I thought it too
First true love, I let you stay with me
I let you tote on Glocks and K's with me
And I really, really want you
To know, to know
Break your heart in centimeters, what I'ma do
To know, to know
So baby, so long, so long
So baby, so long, so long
So baby, so long
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
Feelings I just can't ignore
Heartbreaks, we been here times before
So baby, so long, so long
I'm not playing fair, playing fair
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
So baby, so long, so long
Do you like me for me or is you tryna fuck?
Young nigga on the C class, booted up
Young nigga on that Henn-dog, bae, what's up?
Young nigga tryna pull up, fuck them shoulder rubs
I know that-that love is fake so keep that shit away
Baby girl, I'm from the G, you know we home invade
Baby girl, I love you like I love that baby K
Baby girl, I love you, girl, you got that sweet cake
Sweet cake (uh), yeah, sweet cake (yeah)
I might pack you up and put you in my briefcase
Baby girl, you so damn fine, I think I like you
But I never ever, ever, ever would wife you
Got to think twice, got to think three times
'Cause the last bitch broke my heart like four times
No, I'm the love no more
All the Ferragamo, Dolce Gabbana, Christian Dior
All the Giuseppe, Givenchy, and the Gucci I bought
Tryna say I broke your heart and tryna say it's my fault
Had the key to your heart, but you switched the vault
Damn, I thought you the one, but lil' baby, I thought
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
Feelings I just can't ignore
Heartbreaks, we been here times before
So baby, so long, so long
I'm not playing fair, playing fair
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
So baby, so long, so long
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
Feelings I just can't ignore
Heartbreaks, we been here times before
So baby, so long, so long
