Song Name: Tryna F**k Me (feat. Post Malone)
Uh huh, yeah, uh huh
I ain't gonna let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touch me, I got that dirty on me
(You better watch yourself)
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
(You better watch yourself)
Niggas around me, yeah, they hit licks
Mix a little red and yellow when they get lit
If I turn up with a bad bitch
Have her in the telly doing freak shit
(You better watch yourself)
Niggas sell a little bit of everything
Rockin Yacht-Master and the pinky ring
Flexing like "Bitch if you knew better"
You fuck with a real nigga and you do better
(You better watch yourself)
Shawty ass fat like she a stripper
That wiggle when she walk make you wanna tip her
Bartenders coming, yeah, they move quicker
Twenty, thirty bottles to the rich niggas
Everything cool when I'm in the room
Come with two shooters, not a hundred goons
Nigga don't trip, you don't want that
Boy, you gonna fuck around and get your ass capped
(You better watch yourself)
I ain't gonna let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touch me, I got that dirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
(You better watch yourself)
Right before I came into this bitch high
Needed cigarettes, I made a pit stop
Spend my life tryna be a good guy
Still people want to see me get got
Nothing like it ever was before
Hair falling out, I'm twenty years old
Got a lot of stress, if you don't know
Still kick it like paint and this shit gold
(You better watch yourself)
Pull up in this bitch and I'm flexing
Jumping out the motherfucking Benz, yeah
All these damn diamonds on my necklace
Catch you frostbite when I exit
So goddamn cold, see your breathe, yeah
Hundred cigarettes then I exhale
Dozen forty fucking margielas
(You better watch yourself)
Hundred thousand chains on my chest, yeah
Ice on my rings, ice and you see me shining
Two hundred k in jewels this year, you can't tell me nothing
And I'm gone, I ain't never sober
Me and Fifty got shooters if you tryna fuck me over
(You better watch yourself)
I ain't gonna let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touch me, I got that dirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
(You better watch yourself)
I ain't gonna let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touch me, I got that dirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
(You better watch yourself)
