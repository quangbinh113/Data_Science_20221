Song Name: Put You On (feat. A Boogie Wit da Hoodie)
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on
30, you a motherfucking fool, nigga
I could put you on
Girl, you know that I could put you on, uh
Don't be acting like I did you wrong, yeah
Yeah, I want you but I took too long
I know you heard this about a thousand times
I'll tell you one more time, "You're beautiful"
I hope you don't let nobody touch your phone, yeah
I'm sending dick pics to you all night long, uh-huh
I know you tired of being all alone, yeah
He said he love you, girl you know he don't
And stop acting like you know me, though
'Cause if you know me, you won't come too close
Yeah, 'cause I break hearts on the regular
I am not a rapper, I'm a artist
I ain't regular
Zippers on my jacket, new Givenchy
And that's regular
I switch up on all the newest cars and that's regular
I got all of these VVS diamonds and I'm rich as fuck
I could let you pick out any bag in particular
You gon' let me bust all on yo' ass when I beat it up
Whenever you ready to be nasty, just hit me up
I'ma fuck you all night, call me daddy

Girl, you know that I could put you on
Don't be acting like I did you

Fur coats for the winter time, Nobu when it's dinner time
You know we ain't gotta stand in line
Let me put you on, let me make you mine

Through the good times, through the bad times
