Panoramic my view and leadin' and trendin', whatever (Okay)

Before they hatin', now they say I deserve it (Livin')
'Bout the beef, showin' them how I bring it (Hatin')
Out the beach, sippin' on somethin' different (Swimmin')
Swimmin' in money, they said, "I'll never earn" (Never earn)
Kicked outta school, they said, "I'll never learn" (Never learn)
Now I learn to make it count, yeah
Multiply, division, and makin' a high amount, bitch

Know some Bourbon, bitch, this is a Bentley
Pussy do not tempt me (Skrrt, skrrt)
