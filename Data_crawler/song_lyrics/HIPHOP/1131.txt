Song Name: NEW MAGIC WAND
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I ain't sharin'
This 60/40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (like magic, like magic, like magic, gone, don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (new magic, new magic, new magic wand, I can make her leave)
Please don't leave me now (like magic, like magic, like magic, gone, don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (new magic, new magic, woo! New magic wand)
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (don't leave)
You wanna give me mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand
We can finally be together
Roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck? You're not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You're under oath, now pick a side, and if you don't
I'll pick you both (run, run, run, run)
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I've got a plan, but the walking depends
If you can understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up 'cause I ain't-
I want to share last names, I want to be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin, spillin' feelin's, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for mask, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand
