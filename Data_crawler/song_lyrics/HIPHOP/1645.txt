Song Name: Bars Into Captions
Yeah, Quavo (Buddah Bless this beat)
Welcome to Atlanta, baby, it's bigger than magic
Where young niggas pull up Lambo' trucks and still trappin' (skrrt)
Only place where you can pull up a bad bitch in traffic
Just keep that fire on you (baow)
Won't catch me lackin' (nah)
I put that shit on, lil' nigga, this that real fashion
Now e'ry time they see the Huncho, they like, "Shawty, havin'" (gone)
We too player with the ball, babe, we all passin' (player)
After hour, wall-to-wall, she a hookah savage (hookah)
Yellow gold ropes lit up before for the karats (ice)
Havin' motion, havin' too much motion, we too active (woo)
Turn my savage up (go)
Nigga 'cause the streets get nasty
When P signed me, I seen millions in the garbage bag (su)
Just like Diddy in my city, makin' them bands, can't quit
Then put a Rollie on his wrist, said I was cookin' some grounds with
Think I'm bullshit (ooh)
Come down to the city and it's lit
All these hoes thick (woo)
We gon' fuck 'em all and get rich
So quit worrying 'bout a bitch and get your bag, lil' buddy (oh, yeah)
When you see this double cup, you got to know that it's muddy (ah, yeah, mud)
And I ain't goin' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for somethin'
And she ain't gon' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for money (uh)
Now this her first time in Atlanta
Bounce that ass for the camera
Where your hammer? (Baow)
You know it ain't shit sweet off in Atlanta
This the city (woo)
You know this where the trappers turn to rappers (trappers)
Don't tolerate no cappers
Turn these bars into captions (captions)
And we are
Creature through that come from another planet (creature)
The rocket ship take off, I'm 'bout to land it (Takeoff)
I got a stick, the switch is automatic (brrt)
Ain't never average, keep that "shh" in the attic (let's get it)
Don't tell me lies
Look at your neck, your chest, your breatss
Tell me everythin' that's on your nasty mind (don't lie to me)
Your friends be tellin' me that you tellin' 'em 'bout the D
You ridin' your tank on E, so how you drive? (Skrrt)
I love who you are
Hate that you can't
You're so Anne Frank
Let's take a trip to Greece and hide out for a week (week)
She got a body, petite physique
I went and got me a new Phillippe
I'ma make her cunt squirt, skeet-skeet (splash)
She ain't gotta wrap her hair up in my silk sheets (hell, nah)
Smash and hit the block, like what the lick read? (Talk to me)
Brand new AP straight out the factory (AP)
When I'm on stage, and at my shows, bitches, they grabbin' me (get 'em)
Yeah, I'm the rocket, they callin' me, "Takeoff"
How you passin' me? (How)
You barely see me
But if you do, somebody ask for me
He in the 'Cat, I'm in the 'Gatti
This shit ain't fast than me (ha)
If I pay the rent and get her a bag, she give the cat to me (me)
So quit worrying 'bout a bitch and get your bag, lil' buddy (oh, yeah)
When you see this double cup, you got to know that it's muddy (ah, yeah)
And I ain't goin' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for somethin'
And she ain't gon' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for money (uh)
Now this her first time in Atlanta
Bounce that ass for the camera
Where your hammer? (Baow)
You know it ain't shit sweet off in Atlanta
This the city (woo)
You know this where the trappers turn to rappers (trappers)
Don't tolerate no cappers
Turn these bars into captions (captions)
Infinity
