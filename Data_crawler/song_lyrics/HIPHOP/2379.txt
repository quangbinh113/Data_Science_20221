Song Name: Beautiful Nightmare
We liv' world
I pulled up in a all-black Benz, diamonds on my wrist
Shawty scream my name, so I signed it on her tits (Yeah, yeah)
I'm tatted everywhere, I like the pain (Yeah, yeah)
Got a lotta diamonds in my chain (Yeah)
I've been tryna find love in the wrong place
Hey girl, could you lead me the right way?
I love when you put that smile on your face
It takes away my heartache
Your friends told you that I'm no good
They're probably right, but you knew that
Plenty fish in the sea, girl, you got me hooked
She's reelin' me in now, she's reelin' me in now
Your face, in my dreams
You're nothin', but a beautiful nightmare
Don't go away, just stay, just stay
Pull up in that Benz truck, bumpin', lil peep
I got diamonds on my teeth, promise you, it wasn't cheap
Yeah, baby, that's me, on the front of magazines
I don't fuck with the police, I've been smokin' gasoline
Your clothes on my floor, you're in my bed
I'll never forget the things you said
I thought I wanted more, now I'm not sure
'Cause when you're not here I just feel dead
Your face, in my dreams
You're nothin', but a beautiful nightmare
Don't go away, just stay
Don't go away, just stay
You're just my beautiful nightmare
I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna wake up
I got racks, 'n' I know that you don't care
Heart made of stone, girl, nothing's gonna break us
When I die, girl, I'm comin' back for you
Would you come back for me?
When I die, girl, I'm comin' back for you
'N' I'mma pull up in a all-black Benz
Pulled up in a all-black Benz, diamonds on my wrist
Shawty scream my name, so I signed it on her tits (Yeah, yeah)
I'm tatted everywhere, I like the pain (Yeah, yeah)
Got a lotta diamonds in my chain (Yeah)
I've been tryna find love in the wrong place
Hey girl, could you lead me the right way?
I love when you put that smile on your face
It takes away my heartache
Your friends told you that I'm no good
They're probably right, but you knew that
Plenty fish in the sea, girl, you got me hooked
She's reelin' me in now, she's reelin' me in now
Your face, in my dreams
You're nothin', but a beautiful nightmare
Don't go away, just stay, just stay
(We liv' world)
