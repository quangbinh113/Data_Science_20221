Song Name: I'm a King
[Intro: T.I.]
Big catch-a-cane, big homie wat it is?
I think imma rap straight up fo deze niggaz
[Verse One: T.I.]
Now, errbody wanna be tha king of tha South
Wen, dey ain't runnin a damn thing but dey mouf, no doubt
Iz all good, y'all jus statin y'all opinion
But in da South and in da hood iz undastood witout sayin, iz a given
And ain't b[cause of wat I'm doin fo a livinIz, mo b]cause of wat I do and how I'm livin
Not ta mention wen I'm rappin I'm jus hurtin niggaz feelins (Niggaz feelins)
And still chillin on sumthin das inta healing
Made provisions fo tha clique ta continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in tha house or record sales was through tha ceilin
So, say wat'chu want, and do wat'chu please
But fo fun, I shoot 22's from ya shoe ta ya knee
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggaz'll cum and look fo ya if ya sneeze
Or even breathe tha wrong way, ya better do wat tha song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day
[Chorus: T.I.]
I'm a king! Bank rolls in tha pockets of ma jeans
I'm a king! Ya pussy niggaz couldn't see me in ya dreams
I'm a king! Top topic of all of ya magazines
I'm a king! Head of tha body, leader of da team
I'm a king! Rememba I can get ya block knocked off
I'm a king! A Bentley Coupe with tha top chopped off
I'm a king! I'm connected nationwide within tha South
I'm a king! Jus respect it and keep my name out'cha mouf
(I'm a king!)
[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]

And dis fo every don nigga thankin he passed me (Thankin he passed me!)
I'll jus thank God you gone and da shit'll be nasty (Shit'll be nasty!)

[Chorus: T.I.]
I'm a king! Bank rolls in tha pockets of ma jeans

[Verse Three: PSC]
Shawty I'm down wit tha kings (Kings!), so call me tha greatest (Greatest!)
Number one hustla, I keep tha street blazin
If tha grapes don't sell, I dry'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry-pickin hustlas, out here slavin
Dat king shit nigga run deep in ma veins
Pump through ma heart, live in ma bone marrow, man
Das pimpin! Ma gas iz premium like octane
Can't tell me nuttin bout stackin dez Benjaminz
[Bridge: T.I.]
I'm tha king of tha dirty, see me seated in tha throne
Overruled other dudes, like Caesar did in Rome (Yea!)
Wit a prince das (Hey!) so demandin, and a aura so strong
Tha South ain't been represented like dis in so long
Imma emperor (Ya instigatin man!), ya best be glad (Hey! Hey!) I'm workin on ma temper
Othawise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles ta ya temple
Disrespect us imma blick'em 'til I get'cha plain and simple
Brass knuckles ta ya (Ay!) dentals, blast suckers in dey dimples
[Chorus: T.I.]
I'm a king! Bank rolls in tha pockets of ma jeans
I'm a king! Ya pussy niggaz couldn't see me in ya dreams
I'm a king! Top topic of all of ya magazines
I'm a king! Head of tha body, leader of da team
I'm a king! Rememba I can get ya block knocked off
I'm a king! A Bentley Coupe with tha top chopped off
I'm a king! I'm connected nationwide within tha South
I'm a king! Jus respect it and keep my name out'cha mouf
(I'm a king!)
