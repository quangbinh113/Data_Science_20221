Song Name: Don’t Lie (feat. Nemzzz)
Fuck the fame
Jordan Hersey in my DMs
Charge it, charge it to the game
Them man there brass, I ain't
Get your bands up and listen to Andrew Tate, huh?
That's your girl, she with the ballers in Tape
Hands in the air, nae-nae
Saw bro in a whip tryna get more cake
That ain't your girl tonight
Had her screamin' out loud, no lie, like a 3.5
Forget your man for the meantime
She wanna come the the ends, come be mine
That ain't your girl tonight, she with thе guys
I'ma give her right back by the еve time
She wanna come to the ends, it depends
Bring your friends down Kent for my three guys
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
Yo
I'm cool, I'll pass on that
Her type is rich, I'm young broke man
Got a Burberry bag with a Burberry hat
Got the matchin' shades with a matchin' bag
And it ain't even cold but the scarf on man
And she ain't even bad, all on man
You can ride this bike, no peddle
Just wanna beat, no instrumental
Yo, rough, can't pipe it gentle
Angel eyes, in bed she a devil
Yo, this one gets me mad
Like lowe all the talk, ain't here for that
Big drip inside, outside, are you mad?
Now I got a little clout, they love to chat
(Big, big, big) big stack like KMT
L-O-L, need elastic bands
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
Still with the goons, don't talk loose, loose
Got my brothers, they all got me too
We get it crackin', just like a balloon
Burn a man like we was burnin' a zoot
Haha, I won't lose composure
Big bumper, make her sit in the Rover
I want Yinka, she a bit older
Been havin' rizz done told you
Jordan 4s on resale
Fuck, I missed that drop
I couldn't get that stuff on retail, won't send my number, I'll send my email
J1 got unlimited rizz
She want me for unlimited trips
I don't know why she feelin' the kid
Smash your girl then dip
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
I will die for bro, won't die for nyash
Grab a shorty then dab
Whip, whip, bro servin'
Stuck in the trap and he ain't look back
That ain't your girl tonight
Had her screamin' out loud, no lie, like a 3.5
Forget your man for the meantime
She wanna come the the ends, come be mine
That ain't your girl tonight, she with the guys
I'ma give her right back by the eve time
She wanna come to the ends, it depends
Bring your friends down Kent for my three guys
