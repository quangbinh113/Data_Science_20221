Song Name: Look At Me Now (feat. Lil' Wayne & Busta Rhymes)
I don't see how you can hate from outside the club
You can't even get in hahaha
Leggo
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in ten years, in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari-Kari
Look at me now, look at me now (oh, oh...)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (oh), look at me now (yeah, yeah...)
Fresher than a muh'fucker
Lil' nigga bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick, if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain't really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it, I'm done
Ayo Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Let's go
'Cause I feel like I'm runnin' and I'm feelin' like I gotta
Get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really, really, wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it, then I gotta go and then I get it
Then I gotta blow and then I gotta show that
Any little thing, a nigga think that he be doin'
'Cause it doesn't matter 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything
A ba-da-boom a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lot of things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas that I always win
And then I gotta get it again, and again, and again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the the best
When I come to doing this and I'll be banging on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go)
See the way we all in it, we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, now try to keep up with the pace
And we struggling and hustling, I said it and I get it
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it (Have it)
Look at me now, look at me now (oh, oh...)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now, (oh) look at me now (yeah, yeah...)
Fresher than a muh'fucker
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y'all doing?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like The Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eating, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole!
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain't hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas, they sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch I'm enticin', guidin' light
And my pockets white and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like fuck trial
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch
Look at me now, look at me now (oh, oh...)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now, (oh), look at me now (yeah, yeah...)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucker
Okay, okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a muh'fucker
