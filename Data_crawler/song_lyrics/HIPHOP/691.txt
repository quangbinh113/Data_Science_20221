Mmm, uh
Zay
Mmm, yeah
D-Diego (yeah)
B-B-Bankroll got it
Yeah, I'm back at it (back)
My wrist cost a brick
I'm makin' moves, I'm makin' good habits (good habits)
She fell in love and she wanna slide
She like a lean addict (lil' b-)
Feel like that n-, they watch for me
Said I'm so good at it (I'm so good at it)
I'm on the move, I'm in the tropics, yeah, I'm back at it (back)
Hop in the booth, I make a mil', still want all the static (a mil')
Hop in the Rolls-Royce
I'm slidin' through all the traffic (skrrt, skrrt)
She got a fat a-, I'm 'tryna f- but she all plastic (gang, gang)
I'm more rich than you, can't talk to me, I'm so dramatic (so dr-)
Pull out some racks for the bankroll
She wanna f- 'cause of bankrolls
I'm finna hit different angles
I'm 'tryna go where you can't go
I'm 'tryna focus on bringin' my mom to the hills
I taught myself how to get it alone and don't ever pop no pill
I hold a 30 stick and it got a beam, so I aim the clip (rrah)
You ain't been through what I been through
You ain't know all of that sh- for real
Hop in the Lamb' I swerve (swerve)
F- with a n-, gon' hurt (hurt)
You ain't gotta f- with me, but you gon' get yourself hurt
I'm in the North with the demons, off the Henny, I'm leanin', uh
Thinkin' 'bout bands, I'm fiendin, uh
Think that's what I needed, uh
And I don't feel safe unless I ride around with my nina, uh
Got two h- that'll set you up, Selena and Sabrina, uh
Yeah, I'm back at it (back)
My wrist cost a brick
I'm makin' moves, I'm makin' good habits (good habits)
She fell in love, she wanna slide, she like a lean addict (a lean)
Feel like that n-, they watch for me
Said I'm so good at it (I'm so good at it)
I'm on the move, I'm in the tropics, yeah, I'm back at it (back)
Hop in the booth, I make a mil', still want all the static (a mil')
Hop in the Rolls-Royce
I'm slidin' through all the traffic (skrrt, skrrt)
She got a fat a-, I'm tryna f- but she all plastic (gang)
I'm more rich than you, can't talk to me, I'm so dramatic (baby)

CEO Baby, don't play out here, employ your b-
Mister meet her Monday, then Tuesday, ignore the b-
F-clarity VVs, look at how my necklace hit
HD my timepiece, this sh- come with a glitch
Every other month a different whip, I get bored quick
Puncho in the cut a scary sight, it's like a horror flick
They say I been gettin' too much money, I need more of it
Seen the police comin' in my rearview and I floored it
Pint of Wock', I poured it, your h-, I ignored it
Never see me forfeit, we all got perfect attendance
Your favorite rapper pretendin', I'm somewhere mindin' my business
Yeah, I'm back at it (back)
My wrist cost a brick
I'm makin' moves, I'm makin' good habits (good habits)
She fell in love and she wanna slide, she like a lean addict (a lean)
Feel like that n-, they watch for me
Said I'm so good at it (I'm so good at it)
I'm on the move, I'm in the tropics, yeah, I'm back at it (back)
Hop in the booth, I make a mil', still want all the static (a mil')
Hop in the Rolls-Royce
I'm slidin' through all the traffic (skrrt, skrrt)
She got a fat a-, I'm tryna f- but she all plastic (gang)
I'm more rich than you
Can't talk to me, I'm so dramatic (so dramatic)
