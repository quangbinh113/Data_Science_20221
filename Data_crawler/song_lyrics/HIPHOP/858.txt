Song Name: Ready for War (feat. Lil Tjay)
When you see me rocking my chain
Got like 20K in my link
Nigga, no I never felt like I'ma stain
Glizzy come everywhere, niggas in pain
And we ready for war
Grab that chopper come straight to your door
Leave they body left down on the floor
Drop a body, go searchin' for more
Hit the trap, til' it's gone
Back it up with a mask 'cause it's strong
On my way to the top, I belong
Man, I've seen so much that my feelings are gone
Opps slide, and we scorin'
Can't slide, keep a strap, that's important
Accuracy, I be shooting like I'm Jordan (Jordan, Jordan, Jordan)
Y'all pussy ass niggas don't know the struggle
Livin' off ramen noodles and peanut butter, oh, I got a spoiler
Lil shawty pussy drippin' that Florida water (Oh)
That misery, all that pain, and misery
Back when them hoes wasn't feelin' me
Now my choppa' made from Italy
Ooo
I heard he was a shoota'
I heard he was a shoota'
I heard he was a shoota', and he ready to go, oh oh
Got the big Glock in his backpack, after school (School)
And he ready to bust it, and make the news (News)
I don't care, nah, what you say
Yeah he breaks the rules
And you know, you know, that I'm, tryna go far (Tryna make it out)
Can you make it out this far? (Tryna go away)
And she screamin' out of love (Got a heart to break)
But, she got a broken heart (Oh)
Oh no, oh no
She wanna go to Pluto
Oh no, oh no
There's something that you should see
Oh oh, oh oh
This is a dynasty, young nigga world (Young nigga word)
17, but I feel like I'm grown
When I was locked up, ridin' on my own
And you know when I'm finna go home
But I'm here right now
Can't slack, I'ma snap, this my year right now (Right now)
They gon' stare, bling blow (Bling blow)
I done came this far in a year, like how? (Like how?)
We don't like to play fair (No fair)
Send my killers out [?] make that boy disappear (That boy disappear)
We don't like to play games
They like "Lil Tjay, he made it,
He doin' his thing" (He doin' his thing)
And I'm still with my bros (I'm still with my bros)
I'ma do it for Smelly, you know how it goes (You know how it goes)
Sip a little Patr√≥n
Told the opps grab a life,
And stop callin' my phone (Stop callin' my phone)
New watch, need a bust down
Got used to the hate, I don't really give a fuck now
Show love when I touch down (when I touch down)
Sound different when I step up on the
Crowd, they gon buckwild (they go buckwild)
It's off the top, no rehearse nigga (no, no)
I call the gang, they gon' put you in the dirt nigga
I be in a foreign buck 20 when I skrt nigga
[?] like a hand off, I'm the first, nigga (Nah, nah)
When you see me rocking my chain (My chain)
Got like 20K in my link (My link)
Nigga, no I never felt like I'ma stain (Like I'ma stain)
Glizzy come everywhere, niggas in pain
And we ready for war (Ready for war)
Grab that chopper come straight to your door (Straight to your door)
Leave they body left down on the floor
Drop a body, go searchin' for more
Hit the trap, til' it's gone
Back it up with a mask 'cause it's strong (Way too strong)
On my way to the top, I belong
Man, i've seen so much that my feelings are gone
Opps slide, and we scorin'
Can't slide, keep a strap, that's important (Important)
Accuracy, I be shooting like i'm Jordan (Jordan, Jordan, Jordan)
