Song Name: Solid (feat. Drake)
Ayy, slip, slide, tryna provide for me, for me, for me
Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been making donations to you like United Way (you know how I do)
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day (he told me the truth)
Walking from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away (it's too many rooms)
And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips, I'm riding, all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic
Reving the engine, whoa
City depending, I gotta finish it
I want opinions, yeah, she want a demon, yeah
She want a ring or some sort of arrangement, yeah
Something's that's dangerous
I wanna change it, I wanna claim it, yeah
I want it painted, yeah
She quick to say no 'cause she know she a diamond, yeah
She getting quiet, she on a diet, she want a massage, yeah
Tryna get intimate, bank account never diminishing, yeah
Niggas are changing they images, yeah
Niggas act hard but they innocent
Hop in a tank and move militant, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been making donations to you like United Way (you know how I do)
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day (he told me the truth)
Walking from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away (it's too many rooms)
And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips, I'm riding, all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic
Trunk on the engine
I'm on a mission, the Bronco 250, I'm matching the vision
I got 'em excited, know it's been a lil' minute
I left her delighted, man, I love all the Chrome Hearts
These suckers despise it, the touch is the Midas
She said, "Fuck me and cum, I just do it like loverboy Nike"
Ordered the jet just for you and your friends
I chauffeur you 'round in that big body Benz
Got a lil' bitch that came up from nothing
We shopping in London and doing it big
Been in private but we out in public, I know we the topic for you and your kids
Life Monopoly, going broke, not an option
If they could've stopped it, they would've been did
They would've been did, she could be the wig
Don't play with my head, you test my emotions
Don't be texting my phone every day, I'ma leave it on read
I'm digging and stroking
My new bitch pussy wet like a ocean, I need a new spread
The solid one chosen
Young Gun' Wunna stay focused, I can't let 'em put me on edge
No, they can't put me on edge
I just bust down my wrist and it's rose gold and it's ahead
I just put pointers on 50s
I just counted ten million, all cash, and got head from the feds
Woo, yeah, I just told 'em if he play then we stopping the growth of they dreads (stopping)
I just had talk with the peppermint, post it, I'm never gon' drop 'em this year (skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)
Feel the panoramic doors, we got fours and deuces, toast
I'm the big dog of my coast
Micro, minis with the scopes (uh)
Ain't telling this bitch my goals (my goals)
Had to live in that, the Metro (metro)
I'ma peep, but a player, not poor (yeah)
I been thinking 'bout selling my soul (woo)
Take me out the country and drop me in apartments, she won't see me cry
I just put macaroni cheese in my pocket, it came with the sides
I just put 20 mill' inside a escrow, I don't give a fuck 'bout your life
You had a bust', but that shit was too little, I promise you never was hot
