My young nigga in the cut (swear)
Take you out for some Jordans (Pluto)
Let's count this money, no rushin' (Freebandz)

Loud pack smellin' musty (musty)
These fuckin' police can't touch me (nah)
These bogus police can't touch me (nah)
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me (Freeband Gang)
Apply the pressure with the VVS (yeah, yeah)
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (woo!)
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (skrrt)
Lift it up and gon' and offset it (Pluto)
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry (Pluto)
