Song Name: Solo (Reprise)
Aye, aye, so now I'm
So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So-lo that I don't get high no more when I "Geronimo!" I just go hit
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So-lo that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo it ain't an event
No more
So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do I cut the pony off, now there's a hole that once was a logo
How fitting
So-lo that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Saying they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you Ann
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive but darling this only worsens
So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So-lo that when they throw pussy on pesos I pay no attention to it
So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Looking at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment, watching the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in
I'm so naive I was under the impression that everyone wrote they own verses
It's coming back different and yea that shit hurts me
I'm humming and whistling to those not deserving
I'm stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?
