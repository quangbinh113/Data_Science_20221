Song Name: Find Your Love
We had our problems in the past and it's all cool
You know that everytime you need me, I'ma fall through
I put it all on the line, it was for you, all for you
I keep thinkin' all the time that we wasted
In my feelings, I don't think that I can take this
Oh, can we take some time on this, take some time on this
And try to see if we can fix this
Cuz I don't wanna let you go
Runnin' to your love my eyes right closed
Lookin' at your heart and I can tell it's froze
And it's so cold, it's so cold
But I want you cuz you complete me
Everything about you, I need it
And I'm hopin you can see it
That I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love
Suicide doors on the whip, you could've had it
Everything you imagine, have it
I never ever wanted no static
I'm trynna find your love but I'm crashing
And I been doing drugs, it's a habit
I been trynna change but I'm trapped in
I guess this pain is too much for me
You mean too much to me
So, I don't wanna let you go
Runnin' to your love my eyes right closed
Lookin' at your heart and I can tell it's froze
And it's so cold, it's so cold
But I want you cuz you complete me
Everything about you, I need it
And I'm hopin you can see it
That I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love (find your love)
Oh, I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love
I'd drive a hundred miles just to find your love
(Find your love)
