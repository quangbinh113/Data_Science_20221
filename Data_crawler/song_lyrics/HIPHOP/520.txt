(你准备好了吗?)
I turned to an addict, I bought me a Patek
I bought her a baby one
Yeah, I bought me a Maybach, it came with two doors
Yeah, that's the Mercedes one (fo' sho')
I stay with the baddest, I'm countin' the cabbage while makin' my lady cum (yes)
I bought a G-Wagen, that shit was a BRABUS, that's why I be racin' 'em (BRABUS)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (woah, get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (yeah, get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war
I got static in my city, who fuckin' with me?
Pull up with this 30 and this chopper hold a fifty
Man, I heard that nigga Mickey, that's too risky
Man, we spray his car, spray his window, icky, icky
She keep suckin' on my dick, tryna get a hickey, hickey
Girl, I swear that pussy too wet, sticky, sticky
I kicked her right out of the front door, I'm picky, picky
And every time she go to call my phone, I'm busy, busy (yeah, yeah, hello, hello?)
