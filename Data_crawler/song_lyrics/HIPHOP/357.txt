Song Name: CAROUSEL
What's crackin'? You already know who it is
Ya boy, Big Tuck, Freight Train Tuck
Astroworld is now in session, ya understand?
I'm the dean of this here, I got this
Yeah, yeah
Parked at the Days Inn, ain't takin' no days in (yeah)
Don't need a vacation, I need a replacement (alright)
Bustin' the lights out soon as we came in (it's lit)
What're they talkin' about? What's it pertainin'? (yeah, yeah)
Need me a therapist to ask if I'm aging (yeah)
This M-E-D it feel caved in (yeah)
All of my demons invadin'
I live paranoid, hesitatin'
They bitin', they bitin', the cadence (skrt, skrt)
Go out their way, it's okay
Just lock the doors at the basement
I got a gate with my face in it
Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fades I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy, you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible
Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold, yeah
Mixin' the water with cheese is makin' the money get mold, yeah
Tryin' to be like gang, you better go get it in vogue, yeah
Put 84's on lanes, I robbed, how you think of the spokes
We did it, we said it, we spoke, yeah
We put it out, thought it was small, these five or four, uh
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo
Moving in silence don't mean it's movin' slow
Even though the speed got old
Sprinklin' methamphetamines on the leaves like the snow
Bet they soak
I'm a new species, tale swings on the road
Come to reach and lose both, got springs like a toad
Some for free in the tote
Sak√© drown like round white diamonds
Carats (yah)
Copy sound, might got two wings, parrot (alright!)
Landin' downwind, caught two wings (it's lit!)
Talons scrape, hit the stage, two wings (yeah, yeah!)
Better pray, better pray, two wings (straight up!)
Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fades I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy, you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible
