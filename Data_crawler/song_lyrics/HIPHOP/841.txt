Sometimes it feel like niggas you love the most be the one that brings you down
Just speakin' from experience, 'cause I done been around
I remember shit was smooth, we was dreamin' cap and gowns
Older niggas preached to us the shit that we see now
Some of your friends gon' die, some of your friends gon' live
Some of 'em go to jail for all the shit they did
Every year they solid, every year they straight
I was always solid, solid all the way, uh
The way this shit at stake, you couldn't wait your turn
Studied my position, really had to sit and learn
Reel up all my money, better pay me like Big Worm
Still, I'm cleanin' money like a nigga 'fraid of germs
Drippin', I'm the flyest, you could never call me sherm
This Louis V on me cost me like nothin', I could burn
Life is so funny, like every day I see it turn
Misunderstood, don't understand, you could learn
I was born to be great
And I, won't let nobody tell me I ain't
And I, can't stop, won't stop
And I, I, I, I
You need to be done, done, done, done
And think somethin' over
You just need to chill and focus
Try to get your life in motion
Don't think that I need to
Gave you your position, you just gotta see it through
Tried to help some niggas, they ain't want it, it was cool
Now they try to tell me that I'm actin' brand new
I was on my dick in the pit, goin' through all types of shit
So, my momma always told me, "This the only life you get"
Havin' fun, goin' dumb, 'cause we started off with nothin'
That's when we was tryna catch an opp and put two in his bun
Try to run, are you dumb? It's a beam on every gun
Witnesses is dyin', man, I seen that when we come
I done seen a lot of niggas fold
Seen a lot of niggas change, niggas bold
Growin' up, I'm gettin' old, start settin' goals
Tryna make more money off my businesses and shows
And everybody gon' hate, I'm great, I know
Everybody can hate, I'm great, I know
And I'm just gettin' wiser as you see the time go
I'm just gettin' wiser as you see the time go
And everybody can hate, I'm great, I know
Everybody can hate, I'm great, I know
I, I was born to be great
And I, I won't let nobody tell me I ain't
I, I can't stop, won't stop
Woah, woah-oh
