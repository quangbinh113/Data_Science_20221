Girlie why your backa big and round?
How you buss it down, it made me proud
Maybe that is why I come back again
The dopamine made me do them again
Where the money at? Is probably where we dey
Said she wanna ah, she love to fornicate
Made her suffocate, J. Holiday
Plug said he's French so we call him Trezeguet
Fantastic bitch
She suck my dick, gymnastic on a stick (Woah)
She buss a split (Woo)
Buss in her, buss out, buss the head of a prick (Ah)
For talking shit (Come on)
Bro walks with it, walks with a limp (Come on)
Ting longer than a walking stick (Ooh)
If he strangles the trig no more walkin' for him
Just because you get nyash (Yeah, yeah)
You wanna spend all my current and savings
Can you make it come around like Ms Banks? (Yeah, yeah)
Whatever goes around comes around
Factory made, ain't a buss down (Woo)
If I'm in a club then there's poles around (Grr)
I probably lie when I say my wedding vows (Lie)
Whatever goes around comes around
Drip till you, drown chicks
Skip till you (Skip), get stuck then he
Stick to you (Stick) and get addicted (Yeah)
Big dick for you (Yeah), she blew a kiss to me
Little kiss for you, I got my pistol
I'm pissed for you, you think it's gravy
I'll run up and I'll Bisto you
I got the biscuit, I put the Twix on you, I'm in your district
Little switch for you
They know we linked up when hollow got the links for you
Don't get it twisted, I got a little drink for you
I got my gloves on, don't wanna get my prints on you
Be realistic, got couple gifts for you
It's 50-50, hollow got the splits for you
I'm 'bout my business, I got a couple tricks for you
And we got history, that's why I take them risks for you
I hope you missed me
Just because you get nyash (Yeah, yeah)
You wanna spend all my current and savings
Can you make it come around like Ms Banks? (Yeah, yeah)
Whatever goes around comes around
Factory made, ain't a buss down (Woo)
If I'm in a club then there's poles around (Grr)
I probably lie when I say my wedding vows (Lie)
Whatever goes around comes around (Yeah)
My jacket bespoke, I let the drip do the talking
Water on your neck, don't slip when you're walking
Cah my nigga be quick to relieve you for your jewels
Easy way or hard way, we could do it how you choose
I just fed a bad gyal pasta
If mummy finds out she gonna tell pastor
I shoulda save my money for a rainy day later
But it's already bright, don't worry 'bout my future
My cup's half empty not half full
You can't offer me a slice, I'll take a handful
I cast a spell then light a candle
You niggas ain't nothing I can't handle
Brodie beat the case so I'm thankful
He was way too greedy, he grabbed a handful
I told her arch it back like a camel
Demon time with me but she an angel
Ki le lé, idi nla nla
Location, I'm in South of France
She wanna take trip to Saint-Tropez
How can I spoil if crime don't pay?
Ki le lé, idi nla nla
Location, I'm in South of France
She wanna take trip to Saint-Tropez
How can I spoil if crime don't pay?
Just because you get nyash
You wanna spend all my current and savings
Can you make it come around like Ms Banks?
Whatever goes around comes around
Factory made, ain't a buss down
If I'm in a club then there's poles around
I probably lie when I say my wedding vows
Whatever goes around comes around
