Song Name: Silly (feat. Bugzy Malone)
Yeah
You already know, man
Always silly with everything I do (ha)
Silly when I gotta (uh-ah)
Silly when I gotta (uh-ah)
Silly when I gotta (uh-ah)
Silly when I gotta (uh-ah)
Ah, shit (yeah)
Silly when I gotta spend it
Silly when I gotta end it (yeah, yeah)
Silly when they gonna see me (ayy)
Silly when I get a chi chi
HD and I'm silly
Five figures for the settle
Six figures for the metal
Seven figures for the rental
My opps ain't friendly (nope)
Knew a couple wanna get me
Keep it poppin' like a 64 while sipped up on Tetlеy (tea)
Can't ever forgеt me (no way)
She liking it gently (uh-huh)
She liking it plenty
Mad
I'm silly with many 'cause I got the woo
Ric Flair, I'm in love with the zoo
This bitch wanna hop on a new (wanna hop on a new, she do)
New city, I'm in love with the view
No pity when I fuck up a fool
Too drippy like I got it from Q (007 shit)
Looking like a PT with an ET
Coming through with a badness
Come back with a (ah shit, a madness)
My kingdom make all of them rich
She a baller when dribbling
Moving so messy when she on the pitch, god damn
Silly when I gotta spend it
Silly when I gotta end it (yeah, yeah)
Silly when they gonna see me (ayy)
Silly when I get a chi chi
HD and I'm silly
Five figures for the settle
Six figures for the metal
Seven figures for the rental
My opps ain't friendly (nope)
Knew a couple wanna get me
Keep it poppin' like a 64 while sipped up on Tetlеy (tea)
Can't ever forgеt me (no way)
She liking it gently (uh-huh)
She liking it plenty
Mad
Yo K, can we fuck up this ting?
I don't think you're a YouTuber and I'm a grime artist
Like we don't get these big cheques in (what?)
That's disrespect man are businessmen (yeah)
It was Seven figures for the crib (huh), Six figures for the Wraith
Five figures for the jewels, four niggas in the whip
Free the niggas in the can
Too silly with the creps
One minute let me check, who the fuck is in my league? (Woo)
I took a five minute break last year
And I swear to God the game was on its knees (yeah)
Give a fuck about my opps (uh)
I bounce back, they take a loss (uh)
Blue Louis with the brown leather
Looking silly in the box (wa)
Silly when I gotta spend it
Silly when I gotta end it (yeah, yeah)
Silly when they gonna see me (ayy)
Silly when I get a chi chi
HD and I'm silly
Five figures for the settle
Six figures for the metal
Seven figures for the rental
My opps ain't friendly (nope)
Knew a couple wanna get me
Keep it poppin' like a 64 while sipped up on Tetlеy (tea)
Can't ever forgеt me (no way)
She liking it gently (uh-huh)
She liking it plenty
Mad
