Song Name: Drop A Tear (feat. Lil Baby)
I almost dropped a tear for you, uh
I always throw my pain on you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
My head went straight up, we confused
So many times that we've been traded, we've been used
But I can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
We've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
Can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
'Cause we've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
Uh, like I ain't trippin'
I was caught up in your ways
I'm tryna put on for my brothers, that's my focus nowadays
Like now I'm trippin'
'Cause you was leavin' anyway
And your emotions out of place
I never thought that you would change, I swear
Shit so real, I got the chills
I done made this shit so real
Made some money out this deal
Finna pay my momma bills
For my brothers I drill
Spin up, I brought no chill
Get jammed up, we gon' see who real
In the hospital bed, I was poppin' them pills, yeah, yeah
Me and you ain't close, as we just used to be
Used to be
People hit me up, but I ain't used to it
Family askin' favors 'cause I got some money now
When I get that money all these bitches actin' funny now
I almost dropped a tear for you, uh
I always throw my pain on you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
My head went straight up, we confused
So many times that we've been traded, we've been used
But I can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
We've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
Can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
'Cause we've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
Baby
Told the dealer, got the best appeal lawyer in Georgia
I'ma get it for you
Cookin' up them meals, make sure I eat
You know I tear for you
Can't believe no meal to turn sour
I would've killed for you
Left me at lowest, I can't even say I still love you
I'm the type to tell lil' bro "Don't shoot"
He gon' still bust you
Comin' up, my life was hard
Fat daddy died, we was still in the car
He just did a five, make you doin' time again
I can't lose, no, so I gotta win
I love my dawgs, I ain't gotta friend
Woo 'bout to touch down, he just did ten
Back on the wall, how the fuck I'ma fall?
When I stand on my team, do you understand?
Buckin' the law, give a fuck 'bout your plan
When I hop out my car, my gun in my hand
Niggas switch up and I don't even know why, it's so many shit I don't understand
I can't drop no tears now
I've been cold for some years now
I almost dropped a tear for you, uh
I always throw my pain on you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
My head went straight up, we confused
So many times that we've been traded, we've been used
But I can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
We've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
Can't move on, you know the news had me dropped
'Cause we've come too far, you know we come from the jungle
I almost dropped a tear for you, uh
I always throw my pain on you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
My head went straight up, we confused
So many times that we've been traded, we've been used
