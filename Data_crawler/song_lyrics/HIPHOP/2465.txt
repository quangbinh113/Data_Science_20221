Salt, Salt-Salt, Salt-N-Pepa's here
Salt-Salt-Salt-Salt, Salt-n-Pepa's here
Salt-n-Pepa, Salt-n-Pepa, Salt-n-Pepa's here
Salt-Salt-Salt, Salt-n-Pepa's here
Now, now, now, wait a minute y'all
This dance ain't for everybody
Only the sexy people
So all you fly mother's, get on out there and dance
Dance, I said
Salt-n-Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it back
Cooling by day, then at night, working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it
(Ah, push it) push it good
(Ah, push it) push it real good
(Ah, push it) push it good
(Ah, push it) p-push it real good
Ow!
Push it good

Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby, ba-baby, baby
Push it good
Push it real good
Ah, push it
Ah, push it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, baby-pop
Yeah, you! Come here, gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music pumping hard? Like I wish you would
Now push it
Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good
P-push it real good
Ah, push it
Get up on this
(Uh) get up on this
(Uh, uh) get up on this
(Ha) get up on this
(Hit it)
Boy, you really got me going
You got me so
I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it
Boy, you really got me going
You got me so
I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it
Ah
Ah, push it
Push-push-push-push it, push it
Push it
Push, push, push, push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it, pushit
Push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it
