Song Name: whoa (mind in awe)
He said, "Oh-oh-oh"
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Won't look back on my mom
Won't look back, I must shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was crying
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, I'm gon' shine
To my love, I'm gon'
And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I was like...
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh
