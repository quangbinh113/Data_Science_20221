Song Name: Look How GOD Works
Kicked up with some new chick, got her petty
Do my exes wrong when I get petty
Just tryna pay my rent and get this fetty
All I'm tryna do is hold it steady
Women on they jetski, they just wanna get me
Catch a nigga slippin', wanna get me
Rollin' through the city where the skinny niggas die, uh
Burner on my side, uh
Ain't nobody did it, where I'm from it's on my ex, it was to try
Try, young nigga, just try
Money comin' in, no, momma, don't cry
I know that we broke now but God don't lie
Ever been so broke that all you can do is cry?
Momma wipe the tears from her еyes
Momma can't do it, no, momma just died
Now I'm on the wrong path, chromе .45
Trippin' off this chick that I was lovin' 'til she lied
Broke in Mickey D's so we had to split some fries
.22s, they the only reason we survive
I'm from Flower City where them boys'll do you grimey
Caught up in this life, I'm tryna leave this shit behind me
Things can change for the worse
I done been through it all, been through the dirt
Hurt a lotta people in the times I was hurt
Now I work a triple shift for y'all to make sure it was worth it
Sit back and watch me fly, my nigga, watch me fly
Made it out the trenches, I was sittin' on the side
You can see it in my eyes, we gon' win, I never lied
Yeah, ayy
Said I came up from the trenches, I was sittin' on the side
You can see it in my eyes, we gon' win, I never lied
Yeah, yeah
And ain't nobody ever seen a nigga from my side
Out the trenches tryna slide, tryna get it and I'm winnin' so I swear I never lied
Kiss you on your neck, say, "Everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin' eight
Can't believe she played the witness tryna make them statements
Grace of God, you know the truth, so I'm gon' beat them cases
I would never put my hands on a woman, dawg
I would never let it blam on a woman, dawg
'Cause if you know me, then you know just how I'm comin', dawg
'Cause I done worked to hard to throw this out for anyone of y'all
I came from seein' niggas on sight
Back to back Backwoods on them long nights
Even when my niggas wrong, say they alright
If they gon' lock me up because she lyin' then
Make sure my kid is alright, make sure my chick is alright
And make sure y'all sell these niggas
All my written records that I did in case we face them long nights
In case we face them hard nights, like these
She the only chick I fucked that ever did me this low
But, baby, out in cold, I don't bend, break or fold
I know God got me, I ain't trippin' off these hoes
Niggas show they colors now I'm only with the bros
I'm only with the bros
Shawty actin' like she don't respect a real nigga
Then they wonder why I don't trust these hoes, no
