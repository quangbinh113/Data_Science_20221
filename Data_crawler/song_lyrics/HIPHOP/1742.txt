Song Name: Hands Up (with Monaleo)
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
Head down, ass up that's the way I like to rap
Skrrt, skrrt ride that, after that he need a nap
Hold up, wait a minute you gon' have to wait your turn
Had him first, then had my turn, send him back he yo concern
Bad bitch what you heard, it ain't lies it's probably true
Tay money, Tay Tay bussin' out with your lil boo
Keep my name out of your mouth, I know you worry about me too
Running through his head he chasing me but swear he tired of you
Hands in the air, in the air
Bust it on his lap, he my chair
Party ova here and ova there
If you a real bitch put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
These hoes be dissin'
I put a hoe on a tree and I don't mean grizzley
And before you try me ask yourself is it worth it just like missy
And I know me ex nigga miss me
'Cause he call me when he tipsy
He got a bitch and a baby that stay at the house
But he still be ready to risk it
We not friends you not my sissy
Givin' out smoke I feel like a chimney
That's why I'm the hottest young bitch in the city
I'm walkin' straight in the club don't frisk me
I keep a drake in my purse no drizzy
Strapped up in the booth right now no krizzy
And I be quiet ad chillin'
But when I'mma go these bitches know I get busy
I put my hands in the air, I don't care
I wear hoodies everyday but my arms still bare
And these bitches don't like me, I'm aware
I feel sorry for the next hoe that try me, send up a prayer
Bitch
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Long hair
Lashes with the nails
It's a pair
Killing these hoes
It ain't fair
Hands in the air
