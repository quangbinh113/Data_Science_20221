Song Name: Batman
Yeah, yeah!
Batman, Batman, Batman, Joker just put me on acid
Huh, you on the wave like a Maverick, you need to make something happen
Batman, Batman, Batman, please put me on new fashion
Huh, I ain't learn nothing since last year, you got the renegade fabrics
Batman, Batman, Batman, please put me up on a Tesla (skrrt!)
I'm tryna be hella extra, please hand-me-down a new sweatshirt
Batman, Batman, Batman, heard that you ain't got a mattress
Heard that you king of Manhattan (Queens)
So why you stay in the 'Basas?
Batman, Batman, Batman, we need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war, watch out, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman, I heard you married a Porsche
That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
1, 2, 3, 4, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman, please save the day from the demons
I was sipping, he was leaning, we drove right into a precinct
Batman, Batman, Batman, why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell, but this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman, so fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help
Shooting up on Skid Row, out your window look and you could tell
Get it from under their spell, if I don't do it, then who else?
Need me to shoot up the signal
I'll be there to get the info, skrrtin' through the residential (skrrt!)
I wish it wasn't plain and simple
Lemme pull up to the party, need like 35 credentials
Batman, Batman, Batman, why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell, but this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman, we need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war, hold up, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman, so fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help
Batman, Batman, Batman, that was not part of the deal
You was protecting the bank and then you walked off with a mil'
