Girls want girls, woah, ayy, woah
Girls want girls where I'm from, ayy
Cannot play a player, baby
I grew up with Drea faith
I done seen the realest ones come and leave a crazy way
Had to take my spot, it wasn't just somethin' that they gave away
Sorry to all my fans that might've caught me on a crazy day
Fuck you niggas thinkin' tryna block me on a fadeaway
I been on this shit, I only vibe with a payday
Say you go that way, I guess we both go the same way
Girls want girls where I'm from
Yeah, yeah, where we both from, ayy
And you just got to Miami, need hotel rooms
Niggas told you that they love you, but they fell through
So you shop 42 'cause you, ayy
And you throwin' on that dress 'cause it's see-through, yeah
Talkin' all the shit that you done been through, yeah
Textin' me and say, "I need to see you"
I don't know (I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know (I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know
Starin' at your dress 'cause it's see through, yeah
Talkin' all the shit that you done been through, yeah
Say that you a lesbian, girl, me too, ayy
Girls want girls where I'm from, wait, yeah, woah
Girls want girls, wait, woah, yeah, yeah
Girls want girls where I'm from, oh, yeah, yeah
Girls want girls, ayy, yeah
Girls want girls where I'm from
My girl got a girlfriend
Ain't tryna be out of shape, well stay up on them curls then
If gym don't work, get surgery
I'll pay for that, my courtesy
Can't imagine no bitch curvin' me
I put in that work overly, I handle business
And I got two pretty bitches, keep 'em both on fleek
They got matching Benz and matching APs
Now they can really call each other twins
I'm cool with all the owners, they love me, so they gon' let us in
And bring all of your peers, it look better with more people
We got 1942 Casamigos, it's getting heated
They gotta follow us in the Uber, my car filled up with shooters
It be lights, camera, action when you with us, it's a movie
I don't drive my coupe to house parties, I'm tryna leave two of 'em
Yeah, don't nobody notice the shit that we do
She like eating pussy, I'm like, "Me too"
I can't wait to get off work to go and see you
Please bring your girlfriend along with you
Y'all been on my mind too much, like what the fuck is wrong with me?
She said it's somethin' about the way a girl just makes her feel
Whatever you been dreamin' about, I swear to make it real
Just ride around the town with me, then come lay down with me
I don't know (I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know, baby
Starin' at your dress 'cause it's see through, yeah
Talkin' all the shit that you done been through, yeah
Say that you a lesbian, girl, me too, ayy
Girls want girls where I'm from, wait, uh, yeah
Girls want girls, wait, woah, yeah, yeah
Girls want girls where I'm from, no, yeah, yeah
Girls want girls, woah, ayy, woah
Girls want girls where I'm from
But I know you wanna roll with the gang
And I know you want the finest of things
Askin' me about se-settlin' down
'Cause you know the things are goin' my way
