Song Name: FACES - but like the one the label made me do
Aye
And I'm on the way home, girl, don't you worry
Doing 85, speed limit on 30
When I get home, I'll already be naked
I'm tryna exchange fuckin' faces
And we can go on road, and state to state it
From Houston to Cali, Virginia to Vegas
And when I get home, girl, don't be playin'
I'm tryna exchange fuckin' faces
If closed mouths don't get fed
Then speak up now
On speaker phone before my shit dead
You know I got no problem
Telling you what race is led
No closed mouths
No closed miles don't get head
If love's a song then it's just ours
And we don't need the feature
I spent them dollars to get ya
Now I spend 'em to keep ya
And I don't like playing the game
But damn sure hate the bleachers
So I'm speeding in my lil' Benz
It's black and mine is sleeker
And I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
'Cause I'm too focused on getting this dough
So as I'm moving up to your door
Better start coming out them clothes
Been thinking about this all day for sure
And that's just what, uh, we asking for
And now I'm falling out of liking
In love fast, and yeah, uh
And that's just what, uh, we asking for
And now I'm falling out of liking
Loving fast, and what? (What, what, what)
And I'm on the way home, girl, don't you worry
Doing 85, speed limit on 30
When I get home, I'll already be naked
I'm tryna exchange fuckin' faces
And we can go on road, and state to state it
From Houston to Cali, Virginia to Vegas
And when I get home, girl, don't be playing
I'm tryna exchange fuckin' faces
