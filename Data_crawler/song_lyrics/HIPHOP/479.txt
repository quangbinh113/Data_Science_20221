Song Name: Used To
Oh, oh, oh
It don't hurt as bad as it used to
Yeah, I like that
Freestyle to it
It don't hurt as bad as it used to
I admit girl, yeah, I just used you
I admit this not what I'm used to
I turn up, and I'd never abuse you
Oh, my last girl left me cold
Frozen in the snow
She already knows
It's hard for me to let go
I been drinkin' and drivin' and survivin'
Taking my sorrow and burying me alive in it
Wear your best dress, girl, 'cause you gon' die in it
Bet you regret the day that you lied in it
Crashed the car again, goddamn
I break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm a loner 'til the end, goddamn
Crashed the car again, goddamn
I break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm a loner 'til the end, goddamn
It don't hurt as bad as it used to
I admit girl, yeah, I just used you
I admit this not what I'm used to
I turn up, but I'd never abuse you
Oh, my last girl left me cold
Frozen in the snow
She already knows
It's hard for me to let go
I been drinkin' and drivin' and survivin'
Taking my sorrow and burying me alive in it
Wear your best dress girl, cause you gon' die in it
Bet you regret the day that you lied in it
Crashed the car again, goddamn
I break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm a loner 'til the end, goddamn
Crashed the car again, goddamn
I break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm a loner 'til the end, goddamn
It don't hurt as bad as it used to
I admit girl, yeah, I just used you
I admit this not what I'm used to
I turn up, and I'd never abuse you
Oh, my last girl left me cold
Frozen in the snow
She already knows
It's hard for me to let go
