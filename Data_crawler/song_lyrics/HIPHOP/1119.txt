Song Name: Flashing Lights
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, light)
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do you know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights
