Song Name: Youâ€™re Mines Still (feat. Drake)
If I ever
If I ever made you angry, girl, just know that it get better with time (time)
They say time heals (they say time heals)
She can't see her life without me, she so blessed still
Fuck that nigga, you can't tell him that you're mines still
And she don't wanna go to sleep she angry
Lately, she been noticing he ain't me
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me, 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me
Pretty face, pretty tempting
But pretty taught me ugly lessons
Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin'
So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it
Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you
'Cause they that you would never do the same for me
I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me
And they contradicted everything you claimed to be
I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know
And I know them type of hugs
Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck
And I know they with they nigga but they never brought it up
I'm down these days, down to do better, 'cause you know I done enough
You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you up
But she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she been noticin' he ain't me
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals (they say time heals)
Don't go build no life without me, 'cause you're mines still
And I don't wanna go unless you make me
Down on my knees, hopin' you take me
Better tell that nigga you mine
Heard you've been trying to tie the knot, girl, tell me you lyin'
Let me beat that pussy out one more time
Let me beat that pussy out one more time
I know that you fiend for this
I know that you did not forget
So don't go to sleep
And she don't wanna go to sleep she angry
Lately she been noticing he ain't me
(Oh, he ain't me)
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals (they say)
Don't go build no life without me, 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me
Lately I've been gone, I'm feelin' crazy
Yeah, I'm from the bricks, we got a whole lot of bricks
You got a whole lotta tricks and I wanna see what you do with them
