Song Name: Callin (Ballin)
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road to riches, I got bosses with me (bosses)
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin'),
I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road the riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me
I'm gon' be cool now
I don't go to school now
I got shit to do now
I see different views now
I can't have you using me, using me, using
I got bitches choosin' me, choosin' me, choosin
Back and forth I been flyin' yeah, I've been going hard
Pay that bail for my brother because he fight the charge
When it get cold in the winter I wear that Gucci scarf
We coming straight from that bottom, I got my battle scars
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road to riches, I got bosses with me
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin'),
I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road to riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me
I'm gon' be rich, I'm gon' be rich
I took a risk, I didn't miss
We notice this, I notice this
I'm gon' be big, I never switch
I'll never quit, I'm too legit
You burned a bridge, but I'm gon' be lit
The perfect win, ball out the rim
Switch on me I can't forget, I need a vent
Only get one life to live, I'm on my shit
Bought my school some Harden kicks, we ball like this
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road to riches, I got bosses with me (bosses)
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin')
I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road to riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin')
