Song Name: German
Got my wrist blinging in a German.
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
They think they making P's we be making R's
They be taking bus we in a foreign cars
Come and take some change
Top up your oyster card
We'll be living large because the world is ours
Because the world is ours
Look at my wrist and set reward for all these battle scares
Look at my roof I took that off
I wanna see the stars
V-12 engine in a BM Tar
I'm coming fast
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
I wanna make a shoutout to the Teachers
That said I wouldn't make it far
Look at me baby I be pulling up in foreign cars
Je m'appelle the money
Man yeah i got foreign bars
They said that my come up was a fluke
I know how to play my cards
I'm always in a German coop
I don't need no body guards
A German BMW
Be my wife thats all I ask
I got the sauce I got the Juice
Foreign cars we're going fast
I got the black Mercedes too
Theres no way I'm coming last
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German
In a German
In a German whip in a Foreign car
In a German

Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
