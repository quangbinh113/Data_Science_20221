Song Name: Neighbors (feat. BIG30)
Big blrrrd, uh ayy, blrrrd
Uh, ayy, 30
Ayy, ayy (C Mo Productions), ayy, 30
Get 'em, blrrrd
The chopper stay so close to me that you would think we neighbors (we close like neighbors)
That pussy not what he 'posed to be 'cause his mama raised him ('cause his mama raised him)
We had a clear shot on his head, but I think God saved him (I think God saved him)
You never walked up, hit your man, you probably never grazed him (you ain't Shiesty)
Ayy, I'm a real gangster, this some shit you can't rehearse (uh-huh)
My pockets used to hurt, now I get racks to spit a verse (blrrrd, blrrrd)
God blessed me with some accuracy on the day I was birthed (thank the Lord for my aim)
Every time we get the drops, I'm the one who gon' scope it first (blrrrd, blrrrd)
I'm in this car that go so fast, that it came with some merch (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I go get free shit out the store, 'cause I'm fucking the clerk ('cause I'm fucking on the clerk)
You was talking gangster on the 'net 'til we found where you work ('til we found out where you work)
I can get you whacked for a lil' cash or a couple of Perc's (a couple Percocet)
Took a nigga pole, Shiesty, why you do that though? (I don't know)
Ayy, I'm from South Memphis, we brought up in gorilla mode (for sure, for sure)
If you don't deserve it or won't shoot it, we gon' let 'em know (we gotta let 'em know)
I'm tryna break down a Cuban and add me some GG4, let's go
Thought we was gon' ride the SRT, I got that hoe a Lyft
We just threw a party on your block, and didn't include the gift (it didn't come with gifts)
I'm smoking exotic 'til the fire almost burn my lip
I'm having Sharklato mixed with Pow, 115 a zip
The chopper stay so close to me, that you would think we neighbors (we close like neighbors)
That pussy not what he 'posed to be 'cause his mama raised him ('cause his mama raised him)
We had a clear shot on his head, but I think God saved him (I think God saved him)
You never walked up, hit your man, you probably never grazed him (you ain't Shiesty)
Ayy, I'm a real gangster, this some shit you can't rehearse (uh-huh)
My pockets used to hurt, now I get racks to spit a verse (blrrrd, blrrrd)
God blessed me with some accuracy, on the day I was birthed (thank the Lord for my aim)
Every time we get the drops, I'm the one who go scope it first (blrrrd, blrrrd)
I'm in the field with choppers, you can't come up on this turf (you not on this turf)
And I'm from Killbranch, we known for killing killers first (we chopped 'em first)
A customized chopper, thought I scratched him with a Nerf (blrrrd, blrrrd)
I'm starting to slide, and I shot my third victim out a 'vert (blrrrd)
I had a Glock 'fore I lost my virginity, these niggas envy me (that glizzy)
Hundred shots out my Infiniti, my opps remember me (250s)
15 shots in my FN, I call this bitch my mini-me (blrrrd)
Bitch talking 'bout matching energy, bitches be killing me (let's go)
Dope coming from where the Spurs play, I'm where the birds play (loud)
I just ran up 30 and this ain't shit but my third play (wow)
Reach for these VV, we let off shots right where the tourists play (the crowd)
Narcs be out on Tuesday, so we pop back out on Thursday (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
The chopper stay so close to me, that you would think we neighbors (we close like neighbors)
That pussy not what he 'posed to be 'cause his mama raised him ('cause his mama raised him)
We had a clear shot on his head, but I think God saved him (I think God saved him)
You never walked up, hit your man, you probably never grazed him (you ain't Shiesty)
Ayy, I'm a real gangster, this some shit you can't rehearse (uh-huh)
My pockets used to hurt, now I get racks to spit a verse (blrrrd, blrrrd)
God blessed me with some accuracy on the day I was birthed (thank the Lord for my aim)
Every time we get the drops, I'm the one who go scope it first
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd
