Song Name: MONEY ON ME
Yeah (Keep that, Paryo)
This guap, it's on me, I'm not curious (we love you, Tecca)
Everything, it make me furious (oh-oh)
Yeah, everything, it make me furious (oh-oh)
I said, "Baby, are you serious?"
This guap is on me, I'm not curious
Bitch, I woke up to a paradise
And she wanna come and just live in it
I do it, I do it, I vision it
I do it, I won't even issue it
Even if you call, we gon' ball
For whenever you call, we gon' ball, yeah
We still gon' ball, whenever you call
We still gon' ball, yeah, we still gon' ball, yeah
Feel like, feel like, she wanna feel likе
She the only one that bе up in my life
Baby girl, we rockin', told her to sit tight
I've been up in the twilight
Chillin', it's something I can't fight
Livin' the limits to see what it feel like
Think you at the top, but we at a new height
She wanna drop, she got a new Sprite
Rockin' with influence just to get by
Had to cut her off, but she knew why
I just woke up, it's a new life
Can't control me (yeah)
None of that can control me (no, no, no)
By my lonely, yeah
I don't really fuck with no phony, yeah (no phony)
What they told me, yeah (what they told me)
Stay ten toes like Tony, yeah (Tony Montana)
Got that Rollie (yeah)
I don't even want that Rollie, yeah, nah, nah
I won't even take it serious (nah, nah)
Everything is not that serious (nah, nah)
And I don't even got to stress (nah, nah)
This guap is on me, I'm not curious (nah, nah)
Everything, it make me furious (oh-oh)
Yeah, everything, it make me furious (oh-oh)
I said, "Baby, are you serious?"
This guap is on me, I'm not curious
Bitch, I woke up to a paradise
And she wanna come and just live in it
I do it, I do it, I vision it
I do it, I won't even issue it
Even if you call, we gon' ball
For whenever you call, we gon' ball, yeah
We still gon' ball, whenever you call
We still gon' ball, yeah, we still gon' ball, yeah
This money on me, I'm not curious
Money on me, damn
Everything, it make me furious
Yeah, yeah, everything, it make me furious
This guap is on me, I'm not-
This guap is on me, I'm not feelin' it
