Song Name: Warm - Remix
(M1OnTheBeat)
I stopped rapping and reoffended (uh)
You know when the trap needs mendin' (fixing)
Too much mix in the Brizzy (brizzy)
You know when the pack needs blendin' (blending)
Buy it, cop it, tell me who shottin' it, the gangs are spending
You never beat the mash off one hand (bah)
After the bootin' (Bah), your hand's all tremblin' (bah)
Too much cap I'm hearin' (hearin')
Too much swag they wearin' (huh)
And they ain't bought no hammer, that's so backwards, man, that's scary (horrid)
Shootouts in the winter, lettin' off bine and my eyes all teary
My football boots been dirty (dirty)
You can't rap like that, you ain't certi (you can't)
Only time I step out naked is when I'm fresh out the en-suite (fresh, fresh)
I know I'm a rapper, I'm sorry to say "It's on me" (person)
Pocket, rocket, lock it, shorty thinks it's fake (huh)
Great, she don't know that I try get man in his face (bow)
If I fire this 4 in the neighbourhood
You gonna hear goodness grace (gracious)
If I bust this brick in the kitchen
Listen, you gonna need two, three plates (bring that)
Prada drops 'cause I'm proud of bae
This one's long, but small like Nafe
Pick up them cases, don't want a case (you know)
Out here on the block and you know we're warm (you know we're warm, you know we got it)
Feds wanna search for hammers, I know that they hope they're warm (warm)
Two L's, show enough to the bells
Only go when the corn gets warm (beat it)
Phone call from bae as well
Home soon, make sure it's warm
Why they act tough like we ain't seen no crime? (big smoke, K-Trap)
Way before we had Rolex watches, boy, it was schemin' time (mhm-mm)
Pull up in four Rolls Royces, look at them racist faces
I know they can't stand me, secretly wish they could still hang me
But, now, they got to hang me next to the Banksy (art piece)
Paintin' pictures (greaze)
Came in the game with a three-point-five and my violent
Scriptures, who got vision, who's talking business?
They wanna tell me who's beefing who, I wanna talk about racks and plays
I see forty Ms on the table, it's about time that I act my wage, I'm paid
African boy, no MBE (chief)
Walk in the club with some MB freez on a U-S-B
Walked back out the club with a hundred Gs
Who's beefin' me? (Huh?)
Tofiaqua
My soldier rise that glee and bap (grr)
Old school Meridian, Mali Christian, free up the you know the hood miss them
Remember when them man tried pull up, silly you know it was full up (tsh tsh, tsh)
Done it broad day should've put my hood up (uh)
I'm back and better, tell you about times it was Mac-Beretta
Now we got the glee and K, that's better (uhm uhm)
Blessed with a SK verse, Stressed when the SK burst
Told my boota' don't let it go, wait for the hand gesture first
Get backs that's major, do you like warm? Trending a year later (yeah)
Power with the paper, business man before it was fly and a razor (yeah)
Really flew bae out over seas, unlimited sun and loads of sea
Gang still giving them holy Ts, AK in the back gotta' fold the seat
Remember when we pulled up
With the saw off, now we got the G19, I give it to P (glee)
Even though I'm the rapper he's got more tapes than me
Out here on the block and you know we're warm (you know we're warm, you know we got it)
Feds wanna search for hammers, I know that they hope they're warm (warm)
Two L's, show enough to the bells
Only go when the corn gets warm (beat it)
Phone call from bae as well
Home soon, make sure it's warm
(Can't go back if blood gets drawn, drawn)
(Send man home with their jackets torn)
