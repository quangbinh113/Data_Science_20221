Song Name: Hide (feat. Seezyn)
Need a drink? (Hoo, ayy, ayy)
Found my home (Hoo, ooh, hoo, oh)
She make me leave the thrills at home and
I'm fine...
Really think I found my home
Shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you, are hard to find
I hope you don't mind
If I give you
The time of your life, life, life
Really think I found my home
Shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it
Life is not the same
With your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here
I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down
I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it
Really think I found my home
Shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it
