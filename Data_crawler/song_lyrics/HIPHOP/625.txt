Song Name: One Shot (feat. Lil Baby) - From Road To Fast 9 Mixtape
Drum Dummie
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no - and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
Started with a dream, I lost my brother, think about him daily
See the finish line in my eye, I pray to God I make it
My soul belongs to my family, I can't let 'em take it
So if I live or die, just know forever we the greatest
Modifications on the engine, I'ma hit it
Even if it save or take my life, yeah
I'ma go all out with the ones I came in with
We stand tall if it's wrong or right (Right)
Bring 'em to the stand, have a shootout inside this club (Yeah)
I took too many Xans, I flipped this bitch who even mugged (Brrt)
She told me that she can't f- with me, I approached her like a thug (Huh)
Plus she prolly looked up in my face and seen I'm full of dru- (Yeah)
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
Tell me how I lost it when I ain't even found it yet
Try to ride my wave, wonderin' why they ain't drownin' yet
Choppa make a sound effect, grrat, grrat
I come from Section 8, got eight hundred around my neck
Hellcat take me to the jet, bought foreign cars so I can flex
A simple text can end with sex, I'm tryna set the mood
My Trackhawk run off racing fuel, I'm drivin' like a fool
They see my drip then hold they breath then dive in like a pool
If I got one shot then I'ma blow it (Blow it)
They want what I got, yeah, I'm knowin' (Yeah, I'm knowin')
Pull up in the drop while he snorin' (How he snorin')
And I got that thing on me (And I, and I)
And I hope that they don't think wrong (Bah)
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
Hol' up, I just stepped out in Givenchy boots
I let my doors up, lil' cuz, you see that Draco in the coupe?
Young n- froze up, with a h- from out the state look like Malu
I got the dough stuff, too many killers with me, comin' through
Make me blow your a-, you try to act, I show your a-
And I won't let you slide, you shouldn't have tried, I get you smashed
And I been on the rise, I'm goin' too high, don't wanna crash
Bitch, look up in my eyes, I don't give a f-, I'm really that
Bring 'em to a stand, have a shootout inside this club
I took too many Xans, I flipped this bitch who even mugged
She told me that she can't f- with me, I approached her like a thug
Plus she prolly looked up in my face and seen I'm full of dru-
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
If they tell me that I got one shot, I'm on go
I ain't going out like no h- and these n- know
I'm goin' out with these riches and these bitches know
I'm goin' out past that limit, let my glizzy blow
Hol' up
