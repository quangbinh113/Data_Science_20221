Song Name: Love Scars
Ay
Lil 14, yeah
You used to say you in love
I used to say that shit back
Thinking that shit from the heart
Now look where the fuck where we at
Girl you got me, just going out bad
Love scars, you got me real sad
Lookin' like you had a past
I just thought this shit was the last, oh
Shawty, I just want your love for a minute
I be captain baby, you can be lieutenant
Swear I lose my mind everytime that I'm in it
You won't get a dime, nah, nah, not my-
Spend it, spend it
'Cause I been here for a minute, minute, ay
Playin' games with me Shawty
This is not no scrimmage, scrimmage
Swear that I did it, did it
I do it, I does it, I does it, ay
Shout-out my bloody, my whoadie
Lil' nigga, and shout out my bousins, woah
I swear I'm bloodied up B's
Never throwing up C's
These niggas is disgusting
Some like a disease
Your bitch pussy nasty as fuck
She got a lil' bit of yeast
Gettin' all the money, count it up
Count up all my green, woah
Girl, you got me going out bad
Girl, you got me real sad
Devil in me make me mad
You used to say you in love
Yeah, ay
Shawty you so fucked up
You used to say you in love
You got me so fucked up
Shawty I don't need you anyway
I just sit back in my Balenciaga
Sipping that lemonade
Mixing it with Hennessey
Dominating any enemy
