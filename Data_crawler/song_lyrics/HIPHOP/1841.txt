Song Name: Plan B
Who the fuck you think you talking to, nigga?
Fuck me? Nah, nigga, fuck you, nigga
Dear fuck nigga, still can't believe I used to fuck with ya (fuck with ya)
Popping Plan B's 'cause I ain't planned to be stuck with ya
Damn, I see you still kick it with them opp bitches (with them opp bitches)
I'm the only reason that your goofy-ass got bitches (yeah)
All them hoes wanna look like me (look like me)
Bitch most likely only fucking you just to spite me (ayy, ayy, just to spite me)
But please don't get it twisted, I ain't tripping
I never put my faith in a nigga, bitch, I'ma die independent (ayy, ayy, woah, woah, woah)
If you was wondering, yeah, boy, I'm still that bitch (still that bitch)
I had to block you, but you still gotta watch this shit (hmm)
'Cause who the fuck rock it like me? No bra, tight tees (hey)
Slick back ponytail, feeling like I'm Ice-T (ah)
You know I suck it good, real hood, when you wake up (real hood, when you wake up)
You know her head weak if she ain't fucking up her makeup
Damn, I can't believe I used to let you fuck me (let you fuck me)
I'd rather be in jail before a broke nigga cuff me (ayy, ayy, yeah)
Ladies, love yourself 'cause this shit could get ugly (shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money" (fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight
Because, nigga, that dick don't run me (ayy, that dick don't run me)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right
Before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick
Nigga, yeah, you's a bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Mugler suit in my meeting (yeah), Wagyu steak when I'm eating (ah)
Making so much money, this nigga dumb if he's cheating (dumb if he's cheating)
Bitches watching and hating, put that shit in they faces (shit in they faces)
I'll buy the whole building and keep them hoes in they places (hey, hey, woah)
He submerged in it (yeah), like a baptism (like a baptism)
He hit this water, then he coming back a real nigga (ah, ah)
How you want a bitch (yeah), but don't wanna work? (But don't wanna work?)
How you want a bitch that you don't deserve? (Ayy)
I should have listened to my first mind
And told your ass "no" the first time (told your ass "no" the first time)
Tried to spare this nigga feelings, now he think he hurting mine (ayy)
You cheap, and I be at work while you sleep (while you sleep)
My pussy is the most expensive meal you'll ever eat (you'll ever eat)
Fuck you, still can't believe I used to trust you (used to trust you)
The only accolade you ever made is that I fucked you
You a bitch, if you get the chance, I bet you snitch
You'll never get a chance to tell me come and pack my shit (ah)
Ladies, love yourself 'cause this shit could get ugly (shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money" (fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight
Because, nigga, that dick don't run me (ayy, that dick don't run me)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right
Before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick
Nigga, yeah, you's a bitch (you's a bitch)
