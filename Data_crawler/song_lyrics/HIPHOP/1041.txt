Song Name: Danny Phantom (feat. XXXTENTACION)
Yeah, Bruce, I wanna show you some of this damage
It's pretty hard to miss
Considering it's front and center on this red Ferrari
You can see the 14 very clearly on the front hood
That suspect also put in 1400 on the side door
Before going on to the BMW over there
He also wrote 1400 on the other side of this Orange Aston Martin
Before going on to a second Ferrari at the back, there (yeah, hey) (Star Boy, you're my hero)
Pull up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ghost)
Pulled up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, huh
Let a pussy nigga try me like I'm DeJ Loaf, huh (ayy)
Suck my dick, yes, my body (yeah) so insane, I know, uh (ayy-ayy, ayy)
Bring that back, I'ma swing, let a nigga know, huh (ayy)
Just like the Knicks, play with my balls
Play with my dick, wear out your walls
Just like a gnome, I'm at your home
Right on your yard, pulling your card
My bitch big body, looks like the president
You cannot rap, you are irrelevant
I'm just beginning just like I'm Genesis
She wanna fuck 'cause I got melanin, ayyy
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Pull up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ghost)
Pulled up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (ghost, ha)
