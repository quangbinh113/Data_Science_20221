Song Name: Papi Chulo
Bricks, this shit finna kill these niggas
Go Grizz
Kio, Kio
Uh, met this pretty ting, nice to meet you, mucho gusto
Sweeter than a churro, she call me Papi Chulo
Yeah, I'm single, baby girl, but how 'bout you though?
Tryna make you my number one, tryna make you my numero uno
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
She's sexy
I'm in love with her brain, man, she's stuck on my mind
She only speaks when she has an epiphany
Kind of girl you wanna fuck all the time
Ride me like I'm Ginuwine
I suck on her nipples, she's suckin' on mine
She told me "Hit it from behind"
I stroke it, I pull out, I cum on her spine
Uh, I think that I found me a keeper, por favor mamacita
Let's do it like Mickey and Mallory, get you some ice to go with your tequila
I just bought a Rolex, broke it in half 'cause this one's a creeper
We sippin' liquor by the litre, pussy so good it put me in a sleeper
When I look left in the morning, there's a bitch who's tryna stay (who are you?)
Did we smash or not? Man, I don't recognise her face (who are you?)
I don't need your talkin' or your weed you're tryna blaze (no)
Me and Skep linked up and now we're dancin' in the rave (ooh)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Came out of the car, and your bitch, she said "Hola"
I'm smoking cigars and I'm drinking Coronas
And I met this bitch who was dressed up in Rosa
I tell her "Come here, girl you're very hermosa"
Tengo dinero, forget your man
Come outside, step, man, and look at my dance
Some tequila, man, I'm droppin' my bands
Take the weed off me, man, I'm droppin' my bands
That bitch is way too fire (woah)
Where the hell did I find her? (Mmm)
Man, it's hard to describe her (yeah)
Other bitches don't like her (woah)
It's 'cause she's gettin' all designer (yeah)
Mm, it's a minor (woah)
Your other man, he's tired (yeah)
Fuck him and then climb up (dancing)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (you got me dancing)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet (money dancing)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet (you got me dancing)
