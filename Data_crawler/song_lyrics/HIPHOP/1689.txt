Song Name: killstreaks (with Don Toliver & PinkPantheress)
Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Don't stop, don't stop
PinkPanther, PinkPanther
PinkPanther, PinkPanther
PinkPanther, Pink-PinkPanther, Pink
You got me runnin' 'round the country
I'm tryna find you
I need a girl I can relate to and confide to
See me dealin' with my mom
Will you help me through it?
Heads up, stand tough
Girl, you made me do it
I can hide you in the mansion, might lock the bedroom
Killstreaks, killstreaks, when I need some leg room
Introduce you to the homies, you ain't know 'em
On the flight back to Paris, I gotta show 'em
Baby, did I make you proud?
I know I'm hard to handlе
I'ma come break you down
Even if you don't do scandals
Pick you up and down (up and down), scandals
Pick you up and down (up and down), scandals
Killstrеaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstrеaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstrеaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstrеaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Stand tall (don't stop, oh, don't stop)
Stand up (oh, PinkPanther, PinkPanther)
Say it loud (PinkPanther, PinkPanther) oh
Oh, oh (PinkPanther, Pink-PinkPanther, Pink)
Remember when you came to town? (Town)
I'm ready for you to lay it down (down)
Found a whole new way to get lost around you ('round)
And I can't get help, I'm so down by myself (baby, yeah)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Crash my car and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Crash my car and ride with me
You ain't gotta buy the time for emotionals
You in the books just to see a new perspective, woah
Me, I spent a lot of time in the gutter, dawg (gutter, dawg)
I'm a cutthroat freak, don't hit it, though (hit it, though)
Let's take a walk around Fremont Road, dawg (road, dawg)
All these niggas out here sellin' they soul, dawg (soul, dawg)
Are you really here for me, are you my road doll (road doll)
I don't want another woman, this ain't roll call (roll call)
And I see the good relationship with your mama
Educated, Harvard baby and your honored
And I know the good morals on your socials
First Lady, President, you in the Oval
I'm at the O2, I'm goin' postal
You on the side stage, I had to show you
They told you I was next up, when I told you
I had to fall back just to get to know you
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Crash my car and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Take a look and ride with me
Crash my car and ride with me
