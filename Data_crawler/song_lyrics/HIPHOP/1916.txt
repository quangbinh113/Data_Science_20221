Song Name: Conceited (There's Something About Remy)
See this ain't nuttin' that you use to
Out of the ordinary and usual
You got to have the mind of state, like "I'm so great!"
Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoopping you
Show no love 'cus you whut's up
Look at ya self in the mirror like "what da fuck"
Damn I look good and can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, okay, I got a little fat butt
My shorty tell me he like it like that
(Shit)
I'm happy
Another me, there never can be
See, I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like brandy
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good too be wearing this
You know, I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know, I look way too good to be trying that
I'm conceited, I got a reason
Now, who's that peaking in my window?
Nobody, cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waiting on
He said he loves when my jeans look painted on
With a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty trynna push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen, when I speak out, I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one, I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you
Listen, two, you can neva play me
(Why's that?) Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three is all about me, I don't want too talk about it
If you love to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it
See, I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be loving you
You know, I look way too good to be stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too good to be having kids
You know, I look way too good to be in da crib
I'm conceited, I got a reason
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't what I'm doing
I can't stop, my body done moving
I'm boppin' and poppin' too the music
He's watching me and he's 'bout to lose it
I'm droppin' that hotta, den drop it like its hot
Face down ass up on some new shit
I'm out of control with it
Dip it low, pick it up slow, poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin' but it's cool, my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See, I look good and I'm knowin' it
But I was never too proud to be showin' it
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know, I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know, I look way too good to be trying that
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be loving you
You know I look way too good to stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too be having kids
You know, I look way too good to be in da crib
I'm conceited, I got a reason
