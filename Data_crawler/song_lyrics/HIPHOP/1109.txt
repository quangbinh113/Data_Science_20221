Song Name: Way Bigger
I got bass, but it hit way bigger (ooh-ooh)
Jet ski slide, but the waves way bigger
Goyard bag, but the heat way bigger (yeah-yeah)
Pour that D'USSÉ in my lemonade, nigga (yeah)
Can't get off of the ex six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (woah)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (yeah-yeah)
Really hit the hole, threw the whole knife in it
Eatin' and beatin' the whole night swimmin' (ha)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Eat, eat, like Sandas
I'm blowin' marijuana (geet-geet)
Don't judge me, your honor (yeah)
She keep it on her
At least a hunna
She spend it then she wonder
She flocky, that's my guala (flocky), yeah
Goyard bag, but the heat way bigger (yeah-yeah)
Pour that D'USSÉ in my lemonade, nigga (yeah)
Can't get off of the ex six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (woah)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (yeah-yeah)
Really hit the hole, threw the whole knife in it
Eatin' and beatin' the whole night swimmin' (ha)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Splash on the gas, and a bitch can't get up
Lambo' truck and a bitch came with her (yeah)
Too much money, got shit to get rid of (woo)
Lay your head down, let me get it in the seat up (yeah)
A one time call went down, Vice City (whoa, whoa)
Goin' against the grain, the pity (woah, woah)
Hundreds of bands in cash, it's litty
Rockin' that off the wall (wall)
Split it with the fam I want to
Turn a couple M's and run through
Blue, blue cash I thumb through (blue, blue cash)
Thumb through, thumb through
My eyes red, I'm turnin' up
XYZ's, I'm curvin' up
Need Visine in there, right
Need that lean, iyi, iyi, iyi
Goyard bag, but the heat, way bigger (Goyard bag)
Pour that D'USSÉ in my lemonade, nigga (yeah-yeah)
Can't get off of the ex six figures (figure)
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (woah)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic
Really hit the hole, threw the whole knife in it
Eatin' and beatin' the whole night swimmin' (ha)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
I got bass, but it hit way bigger
Jet ski slide, but the waves way bigger
Go off the D'USSÉ when I do two fingers
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga
I got bass but it hit way bigger
Jet ski slide, but the waves way, way bigger
