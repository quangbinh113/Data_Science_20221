(Two hour long conversations
On the phone
Can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feelin me, feelin' you?)
Baby set the mood, baby set the mood what you smiling for?
Baby set move, baby set the move whatchu riding for?
Baby gon leave, aint no way to sell me, good for nothing cold leads
I know all about it, for her mind to grow leaves
Mentally rerouted me, how she embodied that 6eez
Whatchu know about that?
Shawty been making ramen, what she knew about racks?
And I be steady climbing, whatchu know about cracks?
Cause I be steady plotting, whatchu know bout dat?
I wish you knew about that
Cause a whole lot wont
They can say about me, but my ear won't drum
And they gon hear about me, when I fill my banque
Cause I can see me ballin', wit a sold out show
Cause a whole lot don't woah
But I can promise I would fly baby
If I could have you by my side baby
This song was sprung, to one day see the sun baby
I hope you hear this, and go stupid numb baby
I hate you, but you couped up in my mind baby
I won't assume I knew this day would come baby
Cuz I lived witchu, before your life done hit you with a road
All that single filing, gotchu steady with the ropes
Got us single filing, while you petty with the votes
All us single minded, wanna hit it like woah
(Woah woah woah woah)
If were your man I woulda hit like woah
S'all said now, I'm a man of my word
Maybe shouldn't have, oh well it's all over
I admit it, wait a minute, I'm alone on my road
(Two hour long conversations
On the phone
Can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feelin me, feelin' you?)
You know it's all better
You know it's all better, when you send I download
Winter's all better
Winter's all better, cause ma hustle all full
And my bull is on low
You never hit me back
You never hit em back
Well I woulda never focused, if I woulda hit you back
And you know when in Rome
I never been to Rome
So how would it sound like, if I don't put it in all dat?
No
Maybe if you feel my heart bumpin'
I wouldn't be contemplating responses
Nevermind me or come find me?
That depends, did I pray today at all?
Or more than once? (Did I pray today?)
Where the set? they get responsive (Bo-bo-boom)
When it's time to get the funds
Teleferic they on the line
Telephoned, they at the front
(Prrr)
Hoping I can getchu you outta my head
It's like that any moment is a mile long
I wanna sit alone on my bed oh no no
When am I allowed that? no no
(Two hour long conversations
On the phone
Can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feelin me, feelin' you?)
Wit me conversation patiently
I'm impatient, waiting
I'm invading you
Million hours later, weighted
I been baited
Paid it, homage laid for you
Hope
That
Shit
Proves
Something
(Two hour long conversations
On the phone
Can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feelin me, feelin' you?
Everything you say and everything you do
Gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feelin me, feelin' you?)
