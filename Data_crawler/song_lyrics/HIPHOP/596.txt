Song Name: Tell Me U Luv Me (with Trippie Redd)
Tell me you love me, tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Bitch, I'm a druggie, so can you hide my drugs from me?
And when I get lonely, can you be my company?
Drugs to the brain, swervin' inside of a Benz truck
I cannot stay in my lane, um, yes, I got you in my brain, duh
Um, you can't hide, you can't run, um, we're forever in love
Um, if you leave there'd be torment, torment, torment, torment
Don't run from me, you can't have it any other way
It's me or no one
If you leave, I'll take your life away like you were no one
So tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me it'll be okay (Tell me it'll be okay, okay)
Tell me you love me, tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Heart on my sleeve, ball with it like a throwback
Mind in the clouds, I will never ever come back home
You fightin' through a text, using all caps
Fuck this, screw that, you saying to send you back home
Well baby girl, I don't want to do that
It's true that you the only home I know
Without you, all it ever does is snow
My voice too deep for a average ho
Babe, welcome to my world, dark and confusin'
Get lost in it often, the same way I'm lost in you
And it's often my mind that I'm losin'
See half of it stuck in a pill bottle, high and confused
Don't even know what the fuck I be doin'
Pray everyday that I'm far from a nuisance
Tryna figure out how to live with the blueprints
To give you the heart out my chest 'cause I know that it's true
I know that it's true (I know that it's true), I know that (I know that)
To give you the heart out my chest because I know that it's true
So tell me you love me (Tell me you love me), tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Tell me you love me, tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
