Song Name: Starlight
Uoy evol I, sdrow rehto ni
Uoy evol I, sdrow rehto ni
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two in the blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastime
'Nough pollution in the ends
I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrean, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know them man talk on the kid, but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected
Any girl that I'm datin' knows
Bags that I buy come filled with 50's
She a ten out of ten on a bad day
Public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
I'll put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected
In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts and the ring?
But don't help in the gym, 'nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me
Have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
See her ex men, she got no taste
Hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she tone and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (darlin' miss me)
Oh, God, knows I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you
