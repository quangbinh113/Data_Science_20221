Song Name: Black & White
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Oh, we'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends (Woah)
Before the night begins
Lord have mercy
I know that these percys finna hurt me
Ayy, sometimes I feel like they doin' surgery
Tell me, are they workin', (Are they workin') are they workin'
Tell me, are they workin'
I party too damn much
Ayy, and you niggas can't keep up
I'm getting too fucked up, too fucked up, yeah
I'm too fucked up, won't look up til' the sun come up
Pills with the Hennessy I might throw up
I might throw up, I'll be okay
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Oh, we'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends (Woah)
Before the night begins
Every day's a party, don't let no one tell you different
No lames allowed
You should really keep your distance
Smokin' on loud, and that codeine I sip
Pourin' up this purple shit until it's in my piss
R.I.P to Prince, we got purple rain on deck
She loves Bobby Brown so he keep the Cane on deck
There be haters 'round, keep an AK on deck
Man down, man down on board
Party animals, I'm a lion in the zoo
Party animals, I'm a lion in the zoo
Party animals, I'm a party animal
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Oh, we'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends (Woah)
Before the night begins

Before the night begins
Before the night begins
