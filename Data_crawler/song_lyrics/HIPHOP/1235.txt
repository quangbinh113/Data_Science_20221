Song Name: Stay With Me
Stay with me
真夜中のドアをたたき
帰らないでと泣いた (oh)
あの季節が 今 目の前

Stay with me, lil' bitch, yeah, you know that I'm your mans
You be cappin' like a snitch, no thots won't stand
Two hoes, ten toes, new guap, countin' bands
New whip, new chips, new kicks, Jackie Chan
And she bad, bad bitch throw it back
I just hit another lick and she be counting all my racks
And I be feelin' hella rich, no Brian, hunnids stacked
'Bouta make another hit, goth bitch on my lap
Stay with me, lil' bitch, yeah, you know that I'm your mans
You be cappin' like a snitch, no thots won't stand
Two hoes, ten toes, new guap, countin' bands
New whip, new chips, new kicks, Jackie Chan
And she bad, bad bitch throw it back
I just hit another lick and she be counting all my racks
And I be feelin' hella rich, no Brian, hunnids stacked
'Bouta make another hit, goth bitch on my lap (ayy, ayy)
Ayy, if she fucking with me then you know I gotta get her
I be feelin' like Lil Uzi, got my mind up on the cheddar
Footloose getting groovy with yo' ho, she like me better
I ain't talkin' Ash Kaashh, but that bitch, she be my header
Ayy, I'm posted up with twin Glocks and foreign bitches
No fakes, all they want is guap, I burn bridges
I be getting to the bag, you still cleaning dirty dishes
Two mops send shots at your spot with no limit
Stay with me, lil' bitch, yeah, you know that I'm your mans
You be cappin' like a snitch, no thots won't stand
Two hoes, ten toes, new guap, countin' bands
New whip, new chips, new kicks, Jackie Chan
And she bad, bad bitch throw it back
I just hit another lick and she be counting all my racks
And I be feelin' hella rich, no Brian, hunnids stacked
'Bouta make another hit, goth bitch on my lap
Stay with me, lil' bitch, yeah, you know that I'm your mans
You be cappin' like a snitch, no thots won't stand
Two hoes, ten toes, new guap, countin' bands
New whip, new chips, new kicks, Jackie Chan
And she bad, bad bitch throw it back
I just hit another lick and she be counting all my racks
And I be feelin' hella rich, no Brian, hunnids stacked
'Bouta make another hit, goth bitch on my lap
Stay with me
真夜中のドアをたたき
帰らないでと泣いた (oh)
