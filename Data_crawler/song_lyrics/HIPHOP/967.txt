Song Name: RISE! (feat. DAISY WORLD)
"Mom get 'em" shut yo' ass up!
Dedicated to the haters, the non-believers, and the disgruntled
Oh, nah, I don't want you to leave
I want you to stay right here and watch Tyler rise to the top
It feels better that way
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (watch what comes next)
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah (you know my style)
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now, I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now as crazy as that sound
Oh, I'll show you something (you might as well just get comfortable)
That's it
Niggas want their merit
Missing cash flow, shawty want some credit
Ah, nigga, you should be embarrassed
You ain't the only nigga that be embarrassed
This shit dead, no need for paramedics
You ain't where you at in your head, shit is apparent
You ain't head nigga 'round here, you ain't the sheriff
You ain't seeing shit how it is, get you some carrots
Let me say this shit right here so niggas hear it
Everything involved in your life is fucking pathetic
Tyler got the talent, Tyler got the vision
Tyler that nigga, so really you can't compare us
Why you filled with terror whenever you in my presence?
Is it 'cause we look just alike and niggas said it?
I will never lose any sleep, I'll never sweat
And I'll always be ahead of you, nigga, don't you forget it
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now, I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something
If I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now as crazy as I sound
I'll show you something (man)
With the rockets in my mind, yeah
I could touch the sky, I don't see any ceilings
And if I fall, there's always tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yo)
Let me show you punk motherfuckers what I know
See, I know, I'm the guy that took a chance like Chicago
So I win, I can do this shit with my eyes closed
Can't tell the difference like Michael's vitiligo, yeah
There he go again (woo)
They tried to boycott him but he didn't dim
He started from the bottom and they went to fall off
Like he skipped autumn and spring-summer winds
Look, you tell me I can't, I tell you I can
You tell me I can't, I do it again
Reversing the job, like blowin' a fan
No matter which way you look at it
Understand, it's plugged in
You tell me it's nine lives, I'm pushin' it up, ten
You tell me to do five, I'm pushin' a buck ten
I might just cut off the brakes and aim for the sidelines
For you nothin'-ass niggas and screamin' out "Fuck him", fuck them
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now
I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something (it's gonna be a little painful for ya)
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (you gotta love it) as crazy as I sound
Oh, I'll show you something (ba-ba-ba-da-daiya)
So, so, so
(I'm talking about the tippy-tippy-top)
So (your ladder will never allow you to get to these heights)
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (I can't fuck with me)
Please don't go, please just stay (none of y'all can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay (none of y'all niggas can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay
Please don't go yet, please just stay (y'all can fuck with me, baby)
Please don't go yet (I'm right here!)
