Song Name: Not Out
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
(DJ Durell)
Let's get it
What we doin'? Said let's pop out (pop out)
Updated my roster, had to swap out (swap out)
You can't find it 'cause it's not out (you know that)
(Nigga, we ain't the same, we put that shit on for real)
No for real though (Northside shit) (go)
I hop on the plane (let's get it)
Don't go nowhere without that money on me (money)
I feel like I'm Mike
I got a suitcase with two hundred for emergencies (only)
Two-hundred-and-fifty in bracelets, I'm hunted lowkey, it ain't nothin' to me (shit)
You tryna cuff 'em, but if I wanted the bitch, she comin' with me (bitch)
Fly to a island, hop up a jet, we at the sex retreat
Bitches runnin' 'round geeked (geeked)
I ain't been home in weeks (weeks)
It's a lot of more chicken to get, and I ain't been sleep (sleep)
She left, she did me a favor (thank you)
Now I done turn to a beast (rrr)
I bang her so much the crib told that bit' told me she want me to give her some to eat (you kiddin' me)
He tried to play with the gang, fuck him
Bring out the broom and sweep (sweep)
I BB the belt, diamonds on the buckle
Leather crosses on the denim, touch 'em (touch 'em)
He ain't steppin', boy, that nigga a sucker (sucker)
I'm havin' motion and muscle (havin' it)
I'm havin' motion and muscle
You know I'm really private
But if it's time to pop it, nigga, I'm gonna pop it (pop that sit)
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know we're hard for this shit
We took the gang out the hood in Hollywood
For real (Huncho)
What we doin'? Ayy, let's pop out (su', we gone)
Lil' bro got that stick and he so shot out (brr, shot)
Gang-gang in this bitch, fuck a opp, we a rock out (fuck 'em)
Broke bitch out here trippin', lil' hoe, sit down (bitch)
Pull up, robotic coupe, hit the button (skrrt)
It's night out, lil' nigga, don't touch that (don't touch that)
In the opp party, I'm clutchin' (huh)
If a nigga look wrong, then I'm bussin' (raah)
Too paranoid, geeked off of somethin' (too geeked)
If they lookin', I'm leavin' the country (I'm gone)
Maybe I go off to London
Young nigga gon' blow the door off the function (goo)
Trappin' ain't dead, it's just not in (nah)
Young niggas rather go scam and spend (scam)
Young nigga rather go rap and trend
Young nigga rather go do a drill (oh)
Young nigga better go handle his (woo)
In the trap, I done turned to a millionaire (on God)
He wanted some pounds, I said, "Send 'em where?" (pew)
Ayy, Take', how many bags is sittin' there? (On team)
I can't count the number, all these bags we got (three, four, five, six, seven, fuck it)
Can't tell me how many times I told you you high (high)
I can't tell you how much money we got (nah)
I can't (I can't), I can't (I can't)
I can't (I can't), I can't (I can't)
(You know that) let's go
What we doin'? Said let's pop out (pop out)
Updated my roster, had to swap out (swap out)
You can't find it 'cause it's not out (you know that)
(Nigga, we ain't the same, we put that shit on for real)
No for real though (Northside shit)
