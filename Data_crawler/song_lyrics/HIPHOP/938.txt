Song Name: For the Love of New York (with Nicki Minaj)

(CashMoneyAP)
Bad lil' thing from New York, her heart is too sore
She feel all alone but I've been there before
She just like it when you say less and do more
Baby, we not vibin' if it's too forced
Tired of cryin', she done cried all her last cries
She been heartbroken for the last time
Girl, if I wasn't so heartless, you could have mine
I was in the slums, thuggin' with the bad guys
Countin' millions, flyin' private jets to pass time
And every time I hit the road, I'm on the cash grind
It's hard adapting to this life, I live the fast kind
But we can rock until I'm spittin' out my last rhyme
How many times we gotta argue 'fore we get it right?
'Cause it's been long days and bitter nights
We could talk about it, it ain't shit for you to get a flight
Went through some things that make me see you in a different light
I ain't stuntin' these hoes, I'm just livin' life
But if we fall off, could I still call for some quick advice?
Turn into strangers, still remember what your kiss is like
Lights off, hands on your waist, always grip it tight
Tryna figure out my feelings, I'm confusin' you
Where I'm from, happy endings are unusual
If looks could kill, they'd be cryin' at my funeral
And even when you mad, girl, you still so beautiful (uh)
Bad lil' thing from New York, her heart is too sore
She feel all alone but I've been there before
She just like it when you say less and do more
Baby, we not vibin' if it's too forced
Tired of cryin', she done cried all her last cries
She been heartbroken for the last time
Girl, if I wasn't so heartless, you could have mine
I was in the slums, thuggin' with the bad guys
You said you'd never make me cry, that's right before you made me cry
Said you ain't like them other guys, then you led me to my demise
I never shoulda gave it to you in the first place (place)
And why the fuck I move in with you in the first place? (Place)
I-I was the first one to put you up on that Herm√®s
Exotic beaches, just layin' there like a mermaid
Coulda took your surname, kept you from them birdbrains
Now you in my burn book, fuck you, and what's her name?
I'd rather physical, emotional's the worst pain
You triggering my anxiety in the worst way
Sometimes, the best thing you could do is step away (away)
I'll always be the one you let get away (away)
Put on our favorite song and I just let it play (play)
Pull out the git-at and I might just let it spray (spray)
Bad lil' thing from New York, her heart is too sore
She feel all alone but I've been there before
She just like it when you say less and do more
Baby, we not vibin' if it's too forced
Tired of cryin', she done cried all her last cries
She been heartbroken for the last time
Girl, if I wasn't so heartless, you could have mine
I was in the slums, thugging with the bad guys, hmm
I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone (I'll be gone)
Told my bitch, "Pick me up in the morning"
Gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone (gone)
This is toxic, don't act like it's normal (like it's normal...)
This is toxic, don't act like it's normal
