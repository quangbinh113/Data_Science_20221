Song Name: Twenty To One
Look
Twenty-to-one, look at the time, it's twenty-to-one
I'm on the ride with the guys, and we're lookin' for him
If we catch him, it's twenty to one
Feds behind me, drivin' a beamer
Odds on my freedom are twenty-to-one
I make a call, I'm gettin' him touched
Twenty-to-one, twenty-to-one, yeah-yeah
Maze in the street
My nigga nearly got done for an AM
He went on the run, he was stayin' with me
I told my girl that we can't be together
She's cryin', that's somethin' I hated to see
Really I struggled to stay on my feet
I'm lookin' for her in the lady I meet
I go two letters that you're gonna see
If you're someone that wanted a way in the beef
A and the E, playin' with me
We send him up to his maker to meet
Where I stay on the street (stay on the street)
There's no love (no love), there's no love (no love)
Twenty-to-one, look at the time, it's twenty-to-one
I'm on the ride with the guys, and we're lookin' for him
If we catch him, it's twenty to one
Feds behind me, drivin' a beamer
Odds on my freedom are twenty-to-one
I make a call, I'm gettin' him touched
Twenty-to-one, twenty-to-one, yeah-yeah
Twenty-to-one, look at the time, it's twenty-to-one
I'm on the ride with the guys, and we're lookin' for him
If we catch him, it's twenty to one
Feds behind me, drivin' a beamer
Odds on my freedom are twenty-to-one
I make a call, I'm gettin' him touched
Twenty-to-one, twenty-to-one, yeah-yeah
Man try stick me two months back
Hands on the wheel, so the car don't crash
Run up on me, there's a price to pay
Dawg, I ain't takin' card or cash
I really did it with class, no maths
Mind don't matter, when heart don't match
A good girl like Pok√©mon
Easy to see, but hard to catch
I'm so real that it's hard to cap
I been low, so it's hard to brag
I been hurt, so it's hard to love
Mom needs it, so it's hard to have
Any ride out, I'm good to go
Bros got my back, it's good to know
If she a nine, that's good to see
If she a ten, she's good to roll
Man clout chase, it's tough to watch
Bad friends is tough to drop
Nuff man tried buy respect
That don't work, 'cause it's tough to cop
Sometimes it's tough to think
No liver left, it's tough to drink
Through the noise, it's tough to hear
Through the pressure, it's tough to live
Through the wire and through the wall
Through the sea and through the earth
Through the fire and through the war
Through the death and through the birth
Through the pleasure and through the pain
Through the drought and through the rain
Through the dark and through the day
Through the love and through the hate
Twenty-to-one, look at the time, it's twenty-to-one
I'm on the ride with the guys, and we're lookin' for him
If we catch him, it's twenty to one
Feds behind me, drivin' a beamer
Odds on my freedom are twenty-to-one
I make a call, I'm gettin' him touched
Twenty-to-one, twenty-to-one, yeah-yeah
Twenty-to-one, look at the time, it's twenty-to-one
I'm on the ride with the guys, and we're lookin' for him
If we catch him, it's twenty to one
Feds behind me, drivin' a beamer
Odds on my freedom are twenty-to-one
I make a call, I'm gettin' him touched
Twenty-to-one, twenty-to-one, yeah-yeah
