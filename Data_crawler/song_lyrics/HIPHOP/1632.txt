Song Name: Hennessy Memories
Yeah, oh, ayy
I, oh, uh
(Oh)
What does it give and what it's gon' take?
You to get back in my arms, surprise, go back in the palms
I'm tired of talkin' to false alarms, the gifts, the cars, the charms
Tell me whose heart's get harmed, where we don't even get to speak
You give me a beep like you was my car's alarm
I'm back to the city, the valley of death where the niggas will die for lovin' too much
Guess I was cuffin' too much, funny, usually I never do much
But I'm caught up in a situation where I'm fuckin' with you and my head in the clutch
Never felt like enough is enough but never know when enough is too much
Ayy, yeah, tell a hot bitch I'm back for the fall
Tell a cold bitch I'm back for the summer
18-wheeler, I run her, I run her
First time fuck her, I back in the Hummer
Call right back, I ignore her call
Low-key dog but it's still my dog
Won't say nothin', but it's still my call
Won't say nothin', but it's still my (ayy)
You took sweet time
All of the times, was dottin' my I's
Got on my grind and you started wildin'
A thot in they eyes, but not in my eyes
Got in the music, I started to find in these songs, and jotted my line
And you started wildin' and goin' out crazy
And goin' out sad, I had to get mine, I'm sorry
I know I had to keep myself
One more time, I need to heal myself
Without the Hennessy, with all the memories
Without your tendency, without your loving me
Without you telling me that we can never be
Weed and good Hennessy, it's all my remedy
Without the Hennessy, with all the memories
Without your tendency, without your loving me
Without you telling me that we can never be
Weed and good Hennessy, it's all my remedy, I
Ayy, first place, worst case, I missed all your birthdays
I was out wildin' but had to go back in my life to go get on my first chase
Bad bitch left me down, let me down and pickin' me up
Robbery, off with my heart
She knew that she had it, she had to go, stickin' me up
Pictures on Insta, we flickin' it up
Everyone seein', ain't givin' no fuck
Wish you could leave it to a bitch to embarrass you
Mayonnaise colored car, the whip is a miracle
This shit hysterical, sittin' in and thinkin' bout Erica
Private jet, dippin' out from America
Just to see how big I got, I probably need a mirror for it
Bad days, good times
All the times that I took time
Those times repeat on my mind
Time after time like a hook line
If my rhyme book could talk
All the pages that I scratched out
Would come together, make a good line
Had memories of when it was fine
Yeah, she want stay, she want go
She don't know what she wanna do
She want me, then she want him
And she don't know who she wanna screw
And I won't lie, cause at that time, I had a lil boo I wanted too
But it was still true, I wanted you, facts
I know I had to keep myself
One more time, I need to heal myself
With all the Hennessy, with all the memories
Without your tendency, without your loving me
Without you telling me that we can never be
Weed and good Hennessy, it's all my remedy
With all the Hennessy, with all the memories
Without your tendency, without your loving me
Without you telling me that we can never be
Weed and good Hennessy, it's all my remedy, I
Baby, won't you talk?
Baby, won't you talk?
Baby, won't you talk?
Baby, won't you talk?
Baby, won't you talk to me, me, me?
Baby, won't you talk to me, me, me?
