Song Name: Messy
Yeah
(DJ Durell) they thought we forgot
We ain't forget
Don't let that broke bitch in 'cause she too messy (bitch)
Who the fuck them broke boys with? Get out my section (get out my section)
Just pulled a muscle, goddamn, too much flexin' (damn)
Caught 'em in traffic on a accident, we pressin' (got 'em)
Smokin' zaza, every second I be stressin'
If y'ain't tryna beat 'em, fuck it, won't you stretch 'em? (Do that)
They wipe they nose for that tissue, God bless 'em (wipe it)
I dropped the four of purp', I call that shit Chris Webber (drink, Takeoff)
I know you niggas wanna be me, but it's levels (bitch)
I got the gang tatted on me, that's forever (gang)
Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever (move)
Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but ain't gon' tell 'em (uh-uh)
Push it, push it, runnin' through it, get that bag, come on (go)
Titanic yacht, big enough for all my niggas to jump on (come on)
I know she came with you, but she lookin' for me to go home (me)
Rollie discontinued like the drank I used to sip on
And that's Act', nigga
Not Wock
Not Quagen, not red
Don't let that broke bitch in 'cause she too messy (bitch)
Who the fuck them broke boys with? Get out my section (get out my section)
Just pulled a muscle, goddamn, too much flexin' (damn)
Caught 'em in traffic on a accident, we pressin' (got 'em)
Smokin' zaza, every second I be stressin'
If y'ain't tryna beat 'em, fuck it, won't you stretch 'em? (Do that)
They wipe they nose for that tissue, God bless 'em (wipe it)
I dropped the four of purp', I call that shit Chris Webber (drink, Huncho)
I'm the Huncho, bitch, I'm 'bout my cheddar (Quavo)
Lil' hoe keep goin' out sad, lil' bitch, do better (bitch)
She want me to hit it, put my blicky on the dresser (Glocky)
Feelin' brilliant just like Elon, pop the Tesla (pop it, go)
Y'ain't got motion, you can't stand up in my section (get out)
I said, "Caresha, please" (su) 'cause she too messy (woo, please)
Bitch fuck my dawg behind my back, but I ain't stressin' (not at all)
You wanted the gang, you shoulda just said it, we would have blessed it (shoulda just said it)
Now shit got messy (uh)
Smokin' exotic shit with an exotic bitch (exotics)
Geekin', I'm bringin' all kind of narcotics with me(Narcotics)
Got guns on the table, I'm like, "Who fire this is?" (who?)
This bitch got past security, I'm like, "Who let her in?" (gang)
Don't let that broke bitch in 'cause she too messy (bitch)
Who the fuck them broke boys with? Get out my section (get out my section)
Just pulled a muscle, goddamn, too much flexin' (damn)
Caught 'em in traffic on a accident, we pressin' (got 'em)
Smokin' zaza, every second I be stressin'
If y'ain't tryna beat 'em, fuck it, won't you stretch 'em? (Do that)
They wipe they nose for that tissue, God bless 'em (wipe it)
I dropped the four of purp', I call that shit Chris Webber (drink, Huncho)
