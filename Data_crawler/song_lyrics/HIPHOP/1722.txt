Song Name: Toot That (feat. DreamDoll & BeatKing)
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock, drop it for me maybe we can roll
Damn, Sarge, you made that? (Toot that)
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, goin' deep too
Roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
I told him, "Get back, back up 'less you got them racks up"
Ain't no competition, tell 'em other bitches, "Catch up"
Throw it in rotation, make that nigga get up on it, bitch
Do it like you nasty, do it like you own it, bitch
Thick ass, got a lil' junk to it (junk to it)
Big booty, got a lil' bump to it (bump to it)
Throw it back quick, he'll run to it (uh)
Got a lot of ones, he'll run through it, ayy (okay)
Dump it on the dick like this, uh (like this)
Dump it on the dick like that, ayy (like that)
Pleased how you want, get pleased how you want (uh)
Drop it down and throw it right back, ayy (hah)
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, goin' deep too
Roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
Big booty got a lil' weight to it
When you see it better wave to it
I don't do subs so you better put a name to it
Head so good get a straw 'cause I probably get a grape through it
What the fuck a broke nigga thinkin'? (Huh)
No mulla, no linkin' (no)
Make shit grow, no shrinkin', pussy been wet, nigga let that sink in
Make him wanna call his woman up (woo)
Tell that hoe, "Good luck"
She gon' fuck him like she like him, I'ma fuck him like a slut
Don't you ask me 'bout no prices, every week they goin' up
He keep askin' how I like it, I said, "Nigga in my butt"
Roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
R-Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, goin' deep too
Pop that cat at me, turn around, look back at me (hold up)
I'm tryna beat it up, she said, "Throw a stack at me"
Sike, you retarded, trick you know I got the .40 (huh)
I gave her counterfeit money 'cause I see that girl been snortin' (yeah)
Throw that ass back on the bitch you came with (toot that)
You a thot, you smashed my bro', you can't explain this (toot-toot that)
Pop that pussy on the Snap' I make her famous
When I hit DG's Wayne he gon' play this (hold up)
Roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up (ClubGod)
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
R-Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, goin' deep too
Toot that
T-Toot that
Toot that
T-Toot that
