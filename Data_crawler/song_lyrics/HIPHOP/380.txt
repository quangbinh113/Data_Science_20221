Song Name: Stuck In A Dream (feat. Gunna)
Oh-oh
Ayy Royce, you did it right here
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream
Started hittin' licks back in 2014
I got the ice on me, dripping Céline
Fives came in off a hunt
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun
Been knew I was the one
Still got niggas on the run, yeah
I got these diamonds, my chain swangin'
I got these bands, ain't shit changed
Talkin' like you want that smoke (smoke)
We want the same thing (brrt)
I got a brand new chain (chain)
Then I wear ten on my neck, mhm
Then I got a new Patek, yeah
Flyin' that bitch with a text
Six on a new fit, 50 for a drop top
I was off a bean, tell me your watch type
Never been a lame, shoulda made top drops
Smokin' on gas, ooh, I lift off
Heard she was broke, this shit 40 on a Patek
I keep 40 racks in my Seattle attic
I hit her two times, then you niggas can have it (mhm)
My nigga pull up and shoot like the Magic's
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream
Started hittin' licks back in 2014
I got the ice on me, dripping Céline
Fives came in off a hunt
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun
Been knew I was the one
Still got niggas on the run, yeah
I made it out of the hood (hood)
I still got some dawgs on the run, yeah
This shit comin' in by the tonne (tonne)
I started this rap shit for fun, yeah
Last weekend I was in Milan (Milan)
You niggas ain't did what I done, yeah
You fucked in the rise of the sun (sun)
My girl got a bag full of buns, yeah
Hit it, I speed up the Porsche (skrt)
Night livin' is a sport (sport)
They pay to listen to my voice (voice)
If you poor, gotta make you a choice (choice)
I could play with your heart, make her moist (yeah)
Told her "Call me", she don't need a toy (call)
I'm a saucy young nigga, no soy (soy)
And they know not to play with the boy, yeah
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream
Started hittin' licks back in 2014
I got the ice on me, dripping Céline
Fives came in off a hunt
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun
Been knew I was the one
Still got niggas on the run, yeah
Ayy Royce, you did it right here
