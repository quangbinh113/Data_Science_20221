Yeah Aye
I had to cancel my bitch, yeah
I'm splashing my wrist
I was down on my dick (yeah, yeah)
Right on gang
I had to cancel my bitch, yeah
I'm splashing my wrist
I was down on my dick (yeah, yeah)
Held it down for my rips (yeah, yeah)
I was drownin' lil' bitch
I was bussin' 'em, bussin' 'em
Meet bitch after bitch
I was out robbin' 'em lick after lick
I was selling ounces after ounces in that bitch
Fuck a pound in the whip
I'm smokin' a pound in the jetty, lil' bitch (yeerrrr)
I'm with Flocka and Fetti, lil' bitch
I'm with Dready my wetty lil' bitch
And as long as you let me, I beat on that wetty
And cum 'til it's empty, lil' bitch
I'ma beat like Betty lil' bitch
I'ma beat it like Teddy lil' bitch
I want you and ya besti–µ, lil' bitch
I want you and that Bentley, lil' bitch
Did it all on the telly, lil' bitch
Put it all on ya belly, lil' bitch
Then I buss down the bezzy
Then I'm bussin' the prezzy
Then flew her out to Benny, lil' bitch
Then I be the Baguetti on top of Baguetties
And tell him Baguetti my wrist
And it looks like spaghetti, lil' bitch
And you know that we trendy, lil' bitch
And I flow with the semi, lil' bitch
What the fuck they gon' tell me, lil' bitch
I was four years old
On the corner, no teeth
Screaming, "Empty the semi!", lil' bitch (shots for B)
You can go and ask Rellie, lil' bitch
Right in front of the deli, lil' bitch
And I buss sixteen
Before I turned sixteen
What the fuck they gonna tell you, lil' bitch
And I buss sixteen
Before I turned sixteen
Right in front of Ms.Penny, lil' bitch
Fuck around, had to bury ya bitch
Fuck around had to bury ya bitch
Fuck around, had to bury a snitch
Fuck around, had to bury the clip (ahhh)
I had to cancel my bitch, yeah
I'm splashing my wrist
I was down on my dick (yeah, yeah)
Held it down for my rips (yeah, yeah)
I was drownin' lil' bitch
I was bussin' 'em, bussin' 'em, meet bitch after bitch
I was out robbin' 'em lick after lick
I was selling ounces after ounces in that bitch
Fuck a pound in the whip
I'm smoking a pound in the jetty, lil bitch (yeerrrr)
I'm with Flocka and Fetty, lil bitch
I'm with Dready my wetty, lil bitch
And as long as you let me
I'll beat on that wetty
And cum 'till it's empty, lil bitch
I'ma beat on that Betty, lil bitch
I'ma beat it like Teddy, lil bitch
