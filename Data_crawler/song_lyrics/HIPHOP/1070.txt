Song Name: family ties (with Kendrick Lamar)
Jump in that- (huh, huh), summon that bitch
Jump in that- (huh, huh), jump in that fire, jump in that bitch
Hitting that fire, jump in that whip (huh), thumbing that bitch
Cum in that bitch (hoe), drumming that- (huh, huh)
Drumming that bitch (yeah)
Chopper doing circles, it's a Vert', Vert'
Take him to the party, he's a nerd (pop out)
I seen niggas hitting corners in the motherfucking 'burbs, huh (pop out)
Done politicking with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Nigga tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the 90s, sitting bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this n- in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (ah)
I was seeing double in the projects
Mad at myself when I put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe that we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, Woo, them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fucking the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I cannot respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swerving through rumors
Avoiding the trends and ducking the hoes
I'm ducking the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy-toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writing my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, hoe
Smoking on yo' top five tonight, huh, tonight, you know
Yeah, I'm smoking on your, what's her name? Tonight, tonight
Smoking on you, shores, ain't 2-9, yeah, 2-
I am the omega, pgLang, Rollie gang, SIE
Don't you address me unless it's with four letters
I thought you'd known better
I been ducking the pandemic, I been, social gimmicks
I been ducking the overnight activists, yeah
I'm not a trending topic, I'm a-
Hold on, y'all niggas playing with me, man
I am the omega, pgLang, Rollie gang, SIE
Don't you address me unless it's with four letters
Bitch, I thought you'd known better
I been ducking the pandemic, I been ducking the social gimmicks
I been ducking the overnight activists, yeah
I'm not a trending topic, I'm a prophet
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel
Bitch, looking for a better me
I am a legacy, I come from the 70
The Al Green offspring, guns and the melody
The big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
Soon as I press that button
Nigga better get right like the ambulance's coming
Us two on a light, Keem been through nothing
Dave Free got, at least, one B in the oven
I'm tripping, I'm juuging, my mental is amazing, brother
Pop off, only on occasions, brother
Rich nigga, mama know I made it, brother
Go figure, never caught cases, brother
Face it, brother, gracious brother
New flows coming, be patient, brother
Show my ass and take y'all to class
I can multitask like Megan, brother
2021, I ain't taking no prisoner
Last year, y'all fucked up on all the listener
Who went platinum? I call that a visitor
Who the fuck backing 'em? All been falsified
The facts mean this a vaccine, and the game need me to survive
The Elohim, the rebirth
Before you get to the Father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch!
Smoking on top fives
Motherfuck that album, fuck that single
Burn that hard drive (burn that shit)
Ain't nobody safe when I come up killing everybody that's outside (who you with?)
Yeah, Kanye changed his life
But me, I'm still an old school Gemini (Lil' bitch)
Let me jump in this bitch
Let me jump in this bitch
Two phones, but I only bring one in this bitch
One daughter, but they all my sons in this bitch
No hoes, ain't shit getting done in this bitch
I'm scary, I got a gun in this bitch
Smoking on top fives, stop playing, I'm that guy
Number 2 DM'ing my bitch
That's cool, I don't ask why
