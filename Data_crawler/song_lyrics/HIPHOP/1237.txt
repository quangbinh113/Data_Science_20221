Song Name: don't wanna believe
Ooh
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid
It hurt way more than it should
I knew that it would
I lost myself 'long the way
You make it hard for me
She don't wanna believe that it ended how it did
When I told her to leave, had to tell her what it is
She was stuck in a dream, thinking that it'd never end
You can blame it on me, you can blame it on me
She don't wanna believe that it ended how it did
When I told her to leave, had to tell her what it is
She was stuck in a dream, thinking that it'd nеver end
You can blame it on mе, you can blame it on me
I never meant to upset ya (yeah-yeah)
Playing with your feelings leads you in the wrong direction (whoa)
Karma came around, leaving me with all this messin'
I don't wanna clean it 'cause it's already been done with
So I take the long way home when I'm sad
Tryna cover it up like I'm using Maybelline
Like I don't give a fuck, leave it all behind the scenes
Acting like I'm okay, it ain't really what it seems
It hurt way more than it should
I knew that it would
I lost myself 'long the way
You make it hard for me
She don't wanna believe that it ended how it did
When I told her to leave, had to tell her what it is
She was stuck in a dream, thinking that it'd never end
You can blame it on me, you can blame it on me
She don't wanna believe that it ended how it did
When I told her to leave, had to tell her what it is
She was stuck in a dream, thinking that it'd never end
You can blame it on me, you can blame it on me
