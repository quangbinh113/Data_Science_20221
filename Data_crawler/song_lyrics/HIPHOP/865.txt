DJ Khaled (uh)
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta make my mind up
I won't grind, gon' shine until my time's up
I got money on my mind, is that a crime, yo?
Don't wanna go back to the days when I was broke
But girl, you my priority (woo)
And I'll put your heart way over me
And money ain't shit if I ain't with you, bae
Give it all away just to get you back
Can't put a price on what we had (ooh)
They say, "Time is money", but money can't make no time (make no time)
Sometimes it's sunny, but sometimes it don't shine (no, it don't shine)
And life is a bitch, but sometimes it's alright (it's alright)
So I'ma let go of things I can't control
Let it go (oh-oh-oh), let it go (oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (oh-oh-oh), let it go (oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (21) (oh-oh-oh), let it go (on God) (oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (let it go), oh
I'll let it go if you say that you love me, that shit better show (on God)
Don't tryna play like I'm slow
'Cause you been 'round the block and I know this for sure (21)
She ask for seconds, I give her some more
And I'm proud of myself 'cause I used to be poor
Now I just hustle and grind and stack it, 'til all of my muscles is sore (on God)
Don't play a sport, but I ball (21)
Answer the phone when I call (21)
I get up whenever I fall, don't try me, it's gonna end up in a brawl (on God)
Porsche lights look like a frog (a frog)
Cost a few hundred, that's all (that's all)
Richard Mille sit on my wrist, I'm big 4L, I don't do shit small (on God)
Ass so fat, can't sit up
Shawty got a load in the back like a pick-up
Quarter million dollars every time I do a pick up
Fans got they arms in the air like a stick-up (21)
Money growin' like it got hiccups (21)
You know it's some dope if I whip up (straight up)
Time is money, lil' baby, you beautiful
I ain't got no choice but to tip ya (21)
They say, "Time is money", but money can't make no time (make no time)
Sometimes it's sunny, but sometimes it don't shine (no, it don't shine)
And life is a bitch, but sometimes it's alright (it's alright)
So I'ma let go of things I can't control
Let it go (21, 21) (oh-oh-oh), let it go (straight up) (oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (on God) (oh-oh-oh), let it go (oh, oh, oh)
Let it go (21, 21) (oh-oh-oh), let it go (let it go) (oh-oh-oh)
Let it go (let it go), oh
