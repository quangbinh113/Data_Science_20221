Song Name: pop a pill
Make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed, oh
Look, how come every time I hit your line I need a buzz?
How come every time we tryna fuck we fall in love?
How come every single time we do it
It's the same exact result
Like I hate you then I love you
Then it's right back to my fault
Like goddamn
Look you make me stress
You should make me stress less
21 questions like you make me take a test
Now I got a fifth in my fist
Girl, you know I only drink
When you on some crazy shit
Learn your lesson
You no angel, don't be lying to yourself
Girl, you no blessing
You know I don't do no crazy drugs
But you got me addicted
Drive me crazy, now I think I need some help
'Cause your love is like a drug
But you're addicted to yourself
(Make me pop a pill)
You know I don't usually do this
Every subject of an argument we have is always stupid
We break up then make up
Then do the whole thing again
Don't you know you really fucking with my head?
You make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed, oh-woah
Yeah, I know all my homies looking at me like, I told you so
But you make me feel a way that I've never known
Got my head spinning like I've overdosed, oh-woah
I can't say I haven't thought about it
Doing whatever it takes to get your ass to come through
If you wanna chill, then we can talk about it
You know that you're the only one I'm fucking with because
Everybody's into something
But I'm only into you
Got me poppin' all these bottles
Doing things I never do
Can't stand it
Like I'm losing sight of who I am
Can't manage
Seeing that you're with another man
Goddamn it
Now I'm out here tryna do the most
All the things I know I can't control
You make me wanna pop a pill
You make me wanna lose control
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed
You make me wanna act a fool
You make me wanna do the most
You make me wanna do some things
And I know they ain't good
But I've overdosed, overdosed, oh-woah
