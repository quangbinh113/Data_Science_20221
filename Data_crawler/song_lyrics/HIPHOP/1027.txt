Song Name: Forever
I want you to live, I want that more than anything in this world (forever in my mind, only you)
I want you to fight like hell to stay with us (the pieces in my life go away with you)
With everybody else gone, I know it might not be what you want (forever in my mind, only you)
It might be too hard for you to keep fighting, so (the pieces in my life go away with you)
If you wanna go
I want you to know it's okay (forever in my mind, only you)
I was all alone, on my own, it's okay though
Do you really love me?
Do you really trust me?
I was down bad, feelin' sad, feelin' sorry
Now you really gone, and I can't get you to call me
Wanna run away, fuck this love and fuck this place
If you was a ghost, I would kiss you anyway
I can't fill my lungs, feelin' like I'm outer space
You're the one I love, but you're the one I hate
I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' perkys not good for my health
Wanna end it all, I can't do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him
I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' perkys not good for my health
Wanna end it all, I can't do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life run away with you
Forever in my
