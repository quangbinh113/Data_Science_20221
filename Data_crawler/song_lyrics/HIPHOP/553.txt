Song Name: Stupid Again
I just wanna say from the bottom of me heart
I'd like to take this chance to apologise to absolutely nobody
The double champ does what the he wants
Uh, woah, ayy
'Bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do her to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends
Just made a flip off the wop
Fuck the Frank Mueller, I jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on the re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again
Uh, ayy
Bag full of bricks
Back sellin' Knicks like Ewing again
Trap ain't bump like this since '06, so the boys just start U-in' again
Clear it out
Grrrr, stick 'em
Air it out
Brrrr, flip 'em
Whereabouts
I ain't never 'bout to give 'em
Fair amounts
I ain't never finna hit 'em with
Triple in it, double-up the stash, caught a brick
Another half, finna got another twenty on the vision
Special lil', flip it, did a caddy from the kitchen
I'ma hustle 'til the car came with another brick in it
Crib came with another bitch in it
If you ain't gettin' litty with the shitty, I'ma put another bitch in it
Bitch better hit me with deep throat (Oh)
And no, I ain't talkin' 'bout Michigan, ayy
Oh, uh, damn, shit
I'm goin' stupid and shit (Woo)
She play the flute with my dick
Wrist, sick, I got the flu on a bitch
I play it cool on a bitch
Hit, stick, that's how I do on your bitch (Uh)
What I'ma do in this bitch
Pussy was great, flew out and flew in this bitch
.40, shinin' and shinin'
Way in the hills, I'm high in the climate
Niggas is trickin' and niggas is simpin'
Payin' for heels, and winin' and dinin'
Jewish lawyers on the phone call
I said I'ma sign that lil' shit when I sign it
I got these Benjamin Frank on my body
Ain't finna fuck if this shit ain't exotic, woo
Ten traps phones 'cause the bitch keep on callin'
Sleepin' on the floor, I be scammin', gettin' it all in
Do the money dance when the money fall
Nigga, fuck my ex, I'm uninvolved
You can suck my dick and lick a nut too (Woo)
Yeah, you don't like me, nigga, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
(Fuck you, nigga)
Damn, he runnin' through all his paper
That's what I do to a hater
Don't touch two things: my hair or my paper (Woo)
Passin' that bitch and she hot
Pass her like hot potato
I grind, I skate her (Uh)
And she look good, I might date her
Pussy was good and I ate it
Lil' bitch, I'm Bajan, woo
Wait, hold the fuck up, hold the fuck up, hold up
So we both at the function, you know what I'm sayin'
You pull up with your bitch in the 458
I pull up with my bitch in the 488
You pull up beside my shit, like
"Yo, what's the difference between my 458 and your 488?"
Just felt like eighty to hundred thousand, cock sucker, beat it
Woo, ayy
'Bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do it her to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends
Just made a flip off the wop
Fuck the Frank Mueller, I jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on the re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again
Hahaha
We don't wanna hear no sucker shit after this shit either, nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oh, you worried 'bout your bitch?
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, she's here
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oui, oui, parlez-vous fran√ßais and all that good shit
Ha, straight off the runway in Paris, nigga
Give ten fucks about a bitch
Give ten fucks about a bitch
