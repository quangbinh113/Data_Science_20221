Song Name: Borrowed Love (feat. Swae Lee & WizKid)
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears
It's just hope, you gon' end up feelin' sorrow
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom
She wetter than a river
Body say so much, she got me off the bottle
I'm finally freed up
She freaky as fuck, I leave, she gon' follow
She gave me a sign
My fingers on her panty line
Rollin' up a dandelion
Took a sec' just to catch the vibe
Second guessin'
That's something I never wanna do
Crack under pressure
That's something I'm never gonna do
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom
Baby girl, just turn off the light, turn off the light
Baby, show me love, baby, turn off the light
Baby, ease my stress, baby, turn off the light
Baby, back it up, don't turn up the fight
Turn off the light, my girl, say you're fine
I need that energy, I need that energy tonight
Gyal, keep it cold and burn up the vibe
Say, me no gon' live tonight, girl turn up the vibe
Say, me no wan' fight every day
Love it when we play, love it when we, yeah, yeah
Say, me wan' vibe on replay
Leave me dumb crazy, love me, baby, yeah, yeah
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom
I'm callin' it quits
Leave that for my ex
We flipped the whole script
I couldn't even risk it
I don't give hints
Goodbye, she was gone by six
I couldn't read lips
It's hard when I'm twisted
