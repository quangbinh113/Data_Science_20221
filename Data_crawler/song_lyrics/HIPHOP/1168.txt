Song Name: Partin Ways
On the grind, can't indulge in the foolish stuff
On the grind, can't indulge in the foolish stuff
Young nigga always held his own
Feel like I'm way overdue for props
Fed up, hell yeah, I been through a lot
Keep it on me, come see if that's true or not
Dropped the rakes, two Gs and a 4L
That's how me and all my troopers rock
Play with us, fuck around, get your shooters shot
It's gon' be a sad day when that Ruger knock
We ain't done yet, we gon' spin the block
Face shot, Spot News what we do to opps
Know 'em niggas want me gone, but I can't go, I'ma shoot my gun back
Only got yourself and some hope, and if I go, who gon' teach my son that?
Breakup, tryna blame my faults and time goes on, but we always run back
Tryna find ways just to cope, I been there before, know we all been done bad
Colorblind, dollar signs, swear that's all that I think about
Internal wounds on my conscience, lose my mind, start bleedin' out
He relate to my problems, so his trauma got him singin' loud
Mixed emotions, can't stop it, and my temper, can't keep it down
If you run out of options, girl, you know what keys to dial
Don't care if this toxic, want your love and I need it now, uh
One day, we was lovers and friends
But everythin' gotta come to an end
Heartbreak got you runnin' again
I just want somethin' real, I don't wanna pretend
Really felt connections from the touch of your skin
Constantly drinkin', I'm stuck in a binge
Are you careless, or was it revenge?
Crazy what the true colors can blend, uh
Think about me all day, what you probably do
Now you tryna get used to somebody new
I could've wrestled some shit just to copy you
I just put all my feelings inside the stu'
I was lookin' for you to lean on
But my son and the music, that's really what got me through
Have you ever let the wrong one steal your heart?
I been a victim of robbery too, uh
We partin' ways and I'm fine with that
'Cause the same old shit, ain't got time for that
Common sense, that's what your mind would lack
Yeah, you tried to play, can't rewind it back, uh
Grindin' for the fam, I was up all night
Likes on the 'Gram got you caught up in the hype
Time that we spent, either fuck or a fight
Then our hearts got cold 'cause the love wasn't right, uh
One day, we was lovers and friends
But everythin' gotta come to an end
Heartbreak got you runnin' again
I just want somethin' real, I don't wanna pretend
Really felt connections from the touch of your skin
Constantly drinkin', I'm stuck in a binge
Are you careless, or was it revenge?
Crazy what the true colors can blend, uh
