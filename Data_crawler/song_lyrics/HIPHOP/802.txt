Song Name: Kobe (feat. Snoop Dogg & Derrick Milano)
Hol' up
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Pull it back, Kobe (Kobe-Kobe, Kobe-Kobe)
Pull it back, Kobe (woo-swish)
I'on even gotta look, I take the shot and hear it swish
I'on even touch the rim, when I pull up it's just swish
Backboard, what? Only thing I know is swish (swish)
Pull it back, Kobe (woo-woo)
Uh, rest in peace to the Mamba and Baby Gigi (rest in peace)
Still remember where I was standing after the three-peat (for real)
Fro was lined up, yelling, "Kobe", but playing peewee
Who you know that shoot the freebie right after they tear achilles? Killer
Number 8 was crazy (crazy) but 24 was scary (ooh)
Respect his name or else he might show up as Bloody Mary (Kobe, Kobe, Kobe)
Won't forget the things he mentioned, how to get a Larry (the chip)
Whatever necessary, he tried to help prepare me
They tell us, "Never look in the eyes of a killer"
I did it out respect for the greatest at Staples Center
The closest thing to MJ, and no I ain't talkin' Thriller
It ain't an "I" in team, but a "ME" in it, please remember, Bean
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Pull it back, Kobe (Kobe-Kobe, Kobe-Kobe)
Pull it back, Kobe (woo-swish)
I'on even gotta look, I take the shot and hear it swish
I'on even touch the rim, when I pull up it's just swish
Backboard, what? Only thing I know is swish (swish)
Pull it back, Kobe (woo-woo)
Shot clock and it's getting late
Crossover then hesitate
Skate by him like a figure eight
Whoever left, dunk bait
Give me the ball, can't wait
Catch 'em all with the pump fake
Money good, that's number 8
Clutch time, hard in the paint (Kobe)
Purple and gold, Laker legend (killer-killer)
Stone-cold, ain't no question
Five-time champion, the eighth wonder reigning on 'em
Take cover, switched up, then changed numbers (wow)
Many tried him, but came up short
24, king of the court
I'ma need backup, mission abort (what?)
You do not know me, you cannot hold me (MVP)
Dribbling left and right, then pull it back, Kobe (rest in peace)
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Ever since a young boy, I've been gettin' buckets (buckets)
Pull it back, Kobe (Kobe-Kobe, Kobe-Kobe)
Pull it back, Kobe (woo-swish)
I'on even gotta look, I take the shot and hear it swish
I'on even touch the rim, when I pull up it's just swish
Backboard, what? Only thing I know is swish (swish)
Pull it back, Kobe
Pull it back, Kobe
Hol' up
