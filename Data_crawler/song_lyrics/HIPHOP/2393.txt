Song Name: On & On
The days goin' on and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
On and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
So fucked up, but we all fucked up
Thought I had love, but my lucks all up
Prolly weren't love till you broke my trust
Now I'm screamin' fuck you from a Bentley truck, yeah
I got a bitch from the bay
Told me pull up to her place
Said she wants to give me face, yeah
I blow the bass out the rave
But I still feel outta place
I don't think that I'm okay (okay)
The days goin' on and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
On and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
You were a brand new face
Was I tell that bitch kid rock
Tryna get a crib in every city when I'm at the top
Even when I reach the top know that I can never stop
Designer on my body from my head to my flip flops
On and on again
It's feelin' like this nightmare will never end
The days goin' on and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
On and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
On and on and on, I can feel nothin'
Started feelin' anxiety inside my stomach
Problems keep comin' in, I keep runnin'
Hope I one day, imma end up somethin'
On and on again
It's feelin' like this nightmare will never end
Haha, that's fire
