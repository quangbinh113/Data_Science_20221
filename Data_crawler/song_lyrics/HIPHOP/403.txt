Song Name: Blue Faces
In the sky, ooh I'm in the sky
All these blue faces
Countin' up all these blue faces
G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick that guap off the stages
(Throw 'em in the sky, throw 'em in the sky)
Say you were my dog, now you're hatin'
Countin' up all these blue faces
(I got all these ones, yeah)
To the G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick my guap off the stages
Balenciaga on my jeans
You hatin' on me, fine by me
Mino world peace, got the strip club at war
Gotta make at least three, three
Pit stops on tour, three
Ran into your bitch and I sexed it
Man, she been gettin' hella reckless
And, who I'm with, you guessed it
Any of you step on my Raf, it's a death wish
Mino world peace, got the strip club at war
Gotta make at least three, three
Pit stops on tour, three
Say what I mean when I'm gone off a bean
Fuckin' on him, fuckin' on me
Deep in that pussy, I tell her I swim
Pass it GB, then pass it to me
Countin' up all these blue faces
G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick that guap off the stages
(Throw 'em in the sky, throw 'em in the sky)
Say you were my dog, now you're hatin'
Countin' up all these blue faces
(I got all these ones, yeah)
To the G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick my guap off the stages
Balenciaga on my jeans, you hatin' on me, fine by me
1-800-KNOT's, got these hundreds in my section
She gon' drop the top, feed her grind like a Mexican
I can't work no drop, I'm a boss
'Til I'm restin'
She gon' hit my line when she off, not a question
Let little shawty know I got my
White and I like the fast one
Better that you go and cut that rope
You need a bad one
Boyfriend on your phone, he so annoying
He a sad one
You about your bread, ain't goin' home until you had some
I don't go check accounts unless
I'm sitting in the bank, nah
Pullin' up, it's a fresh Mercedes Benzo
It's a wagon
Double G, don't wear Guesses
Wrist on ice, my diamonds dancin'
88 throwin' dubs, we makin' it rain inside of Mansion
Countin' up all these blue faces
G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick that guap off the stages
(Throw 'em in the sky, throw 'em in the sky)
Say you were my dog, now you're hatin'
Countin' up all these blue faces
(I got all these ones, yeah)
To the G5 tootsie, that's my favorite
She gon' pick my guap off the stages
Balenciaga on my jeans, you hatin' on me, fine by me
