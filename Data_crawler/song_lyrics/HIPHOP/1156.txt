Song Name: Stuck in The Jungle (with Pop Smoke & Lil Durk)
Coke Boy, baby
I'm up in traffic, I ride with them guns
You know how we do every summer (oh)
Jump out the bed like fuck what it is
You know how I do for my brothers (yeah, yeah, oh)
Chiraq career, they got me on papers
I'm stuck in the zoo for the summer (yeah, oh, yeah)
Ain't talk to my dawg in a couple of months
Can somebody tell 'em I love 'em? (Gang, gang, let's get it, yeah)
Fuckin' these hoes all over the world
I never give groupies my number, uh (let's get it)
Racin' them Lamb' trucks, pressin' the front and I'm back of the bumper, yeah (skrrt, skrrt)
Get 'em Xans up, fuck off a Perky and take off the rubber, uh (yeah, yeah)
Put my hands up, look at the face
And the Rollie, baguette and the buss, uh (yeah, yeah)
I'm not A Boogie, I keep on a hoodie, a hoodie (yeah, yeah)
She want Celine, I get it 'cause she got good pussy, uh (yeah, yeah)
You said they stole your chain, you lied, they took it, uh (yeah, yeah)
Amiris with the Dior Nikes (yeah, yeah)
Through these Cartiers, they cried Armani tears
If a nigga tried to play with my life (oh, haan, with my life)
So watch what you say 'cause, nigga, I don't play
Any time o' the day, it's on sight (oh, grrt, on sight, oh)
I looked the judge in the face, told him
"I don't know a thing (I don't know a thing), I wasn't there that night" (that night)
They said I had a AK in the 'Rari and I just caught a body
I'm like, "Nigga, that's a lie" (that's a lie)
Armed and dangerous, sucker ass niggas can't bang with us (haan)
Angel dust, south Bronx streets they label us, notorious, can't be touched, yeah (woo)
Back of the block, yeah it was hell, yeah, servin' the bundles (the bundles)
Lawyers and opps, yeah, judged by 12 and six-feet under (Coke Boy, baby)
One time for Chinx, one time for Max, you know I'm puttin' you under (oh)
Why I'm still here? What is the mission? You know I sit and I wonder
Haven't speak to my dawgs in a couple of months, can somebody tell 'em I love 'em?
N.Y. crib, duckin' the feds, stuck in the zoo for the summer (ah)
One time for BIG, one time for Pun, welcome to the city of Gods (Gods)
You know the story, ride in the 'Rari, only way get out of dark (Coke Boy, baby, skrrt)
Play like the majors (Majors), life for the rich and the famous (famous)
That's why she's suckin' me off like I come in different flavors
I'm not Tech N9ne, got a TEC-9
Shooters with me yellin', "Salaam"
Pop on the hook, you out of your mind, go tell 'em rewind, baow
Through these Cartiers, they cried Armani tears
If a nigga tried to play with my life (oh, haan, with my life)
So watch what you say 'cause, nigga, I don't play
Any time o' the day, it's on sight (oh, grrt, on sight, oh)
I looked the judge in the face, told him
"I don't know a thing (I don't know a thing), I wasn't there that night" (that night)
They said I had a AK in the 'Rari and I just caught a body
I'm like, "Nigga, that's a lie" (that's a lie)
Coke Boy, baby (Coke Boy, baby)
