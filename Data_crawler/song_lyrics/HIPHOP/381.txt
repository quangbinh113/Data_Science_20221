Song Name: Ridin (feat. Landon Cube & YBN Nahmir)
Yeah, ayy, huh, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money
Hmm, I'm on the beach with my feet up, ayy
Everybody say I'm switchin', I don't speak up, no, hmm, ayy
I just turn my speakers up, hmm, ayy
I just turn my speakers up, huh
I'm movin' on just like my lease was up, ayy
And I'm still poppin' these percs
Lil' bitch, I'm geekin' up, huh
I might fuck that lil' hoe if she freak enough, ayy
Then I have a new bitch 'fore the week was up, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah (Yeah, ayy)
If it ain't 'bout the money (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
Now I grind for that money, I got that green, yeah
I'm grindin' for that cheese, yeah, that cheese, yeah
I run off with your honey, she off the bean, yeah
She wanna stay the week
I make her leave now, ayy
Get higher, yeah, on the West side, yeah
All my life, yeah, think that I'ma die here
I put some money off to the side, yeah
Take a ride with me, yeah
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah (Ayy)
If it ain't 'bout the money (Ayy)
(Grra!)
One day they caught me loafin' after droppin' off my bitch
They sent a couple shots but I'm just glad that nigga missed
Ducked down and started clapping, tried to flip that hoe, whip
But I would rather take a life before my my mama see me stiff
(Ayy, that's on my mama)
So I'm clutchin' on that .44 when I'm trippin'
Trey paralyzed but I'm just glad that nigga livin'
Please don't come to me when that nigga granny end up missin'
I was cooling out in Cali, workin', bitch, I was gettin' it
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with the .40, ridin' with the .40 with a beam, hey, yeah
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money
