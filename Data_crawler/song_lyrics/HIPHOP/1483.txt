Song Name: Count Me Out
We may not know which way to go on this dark road

(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session ten, breakthrough
One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust
This time around, I trust myself (and I'm tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
Look myself in the mirror (and I'm tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)
I fought like a Pitbull Terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived, even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
I love when you count me out (huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Brrah, ooh, brrah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep?
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the bros was at?
3:30 in the morning, scroll through the call log
Ain't nobody but the mirror looking for the fall off (brrr)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop
Call 911, I caught a body
Sun up now, yesterday is fading
Healing's only one mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the women I know (that's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard
Without lifting my head up, that left me fed up
You made me worry, I wanted my best version
But you ignored me, then changed the story
Then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation (no, no)
Thoughts in my head, they living there with no (tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up (shoo, shoo)
Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets
(And I'm tripping and falling) some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best, you said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Some things I must confess (and I'm tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt, can't you see I'm a wreck? (Ah-yah)
Let me lose, I digress, this is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah, ah-yah)
This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the stress? (Ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the-
