Song Name: Together
Oh, oh
Fuck the world
Yeah, yeah
I gotta keep it together, ain't no tweaking now
I gotta pull it together, ain't no holding on
We gotta do this together, ain't no holding on by myself, yeah
We gotta pull it together, we gotta do this together
We gotta keep it forever-ah!
Forever, forever
Forever tryna fight all these demons in my head
Together we can fight all these demons in my head
Forget why I've been all alone
Walking 'round facing all these demons all by myself, yeah-ah

Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah (gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
I gotta keep it together, ain't no tweakin' now
I gotta pull it together, ain't no holdin' on
We gotta do this together, ain't no holdin' on by myself, yeah
We gotta pull it together
We gotta do this together
We gotta keep it forever-ah, forever, forever
