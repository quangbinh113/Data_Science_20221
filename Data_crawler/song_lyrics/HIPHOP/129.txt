Song Name: BAD!
Yeah
Shawty heard you bad, word, so profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can
Girl, going up, going down
In and out, turn around
Shawty heard you bad, word, so profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl, going up, going down
Girl, going up, going down
In and out, turn around
Love the way you moving now
I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in my brain, yeah, oh
Real life, she just wanna heal right
'Cause I give them chills, right
Shawty heard you bad, word, so profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can
Girl, going up, going down
In and out, turn around
Shawty heard you bad, word, so profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can
Girl, going up, going down
In and out, turn around
Love the way you moving now
