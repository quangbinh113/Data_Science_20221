Song Name: Dance Now (feat. Kenny Mason)
Look, look
JID back in the city wit' it
Jiddy done been all across the globe
They say "JID a scribbler, he silly wit' it"
"When he spit and I hope he don't sell his soul"
"He should be good man, he signed to Cole"
"He from the hood nigga down the road"
"He was just juugin' right by the sto'"
Then they saw the patrol, it was time to roll
Saw the patrol, it was time to ride, motor running on Memorial Drive
Got a country cousin cruisin' wit' the blammer in
Savannah at the Florida-Georgia line
Got a couple family members in Atlanta
Not Atlanta, we let Omeretta decide
They just gon' let that Beretta fly
'Cause you niggas buggin', spray pesticides
It's me and the bros, it's no extra guys
And they movin' weight, it's no exercise
We can pick a day to come stretch you out
Only showing muscle when it's flexing time
You can see the hustle, you can recognize
Overcame struggle when the devil tried
Let me bare it all when I'm telling God
You know I'ma rant when I talk to Jah
Niggas say that I can't, damn lie
Ain't dappin' no hand, sanitize
I'm gon' slide on your man, landslide
There's a 9 in my pants, hand cock
You gon' try to recant, you can't now
I could step on a ant, ant pile
I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now, dan-, dan-, dan-
Oh what a handsome gift, to live in a land of sin (yeah, uh)
Runnin' with bands and bricks, and my lil' nasty chick (uh, yeah)
That's what I asked of him, told me he'd grant my wish (yeah)
You dance with the devil, you never dance again
Dance now, dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now
Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now
Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now (I'm not a)
Dan-, dan-, dan- (I'm not a, uh)
I'm not a two-steppin' man, I said I do not dance
It's a gun inside my pants, and the whole world's in his hands (dance)
It depends, penny for your sins (for your sins)
Shootin' up the block can't stop revenge (oh)
Nappy dreadlocks like a Rastaman (Rastaman)
Where the story ends and the plot begins (uh, look)
Momma said the Messiah's in moccasins
Tryna save the kids in them apartments and
Show a way to live with other options
Opulence, decadence, black excellence and lots of it
I could cop the newest Bimmer, Bentley, or Balenciagas
I could pay for this little nigga's scholarship
I ain't caught up in rap nigga politics
Play with me and you're playing yourself
Playing with death, say him a prayer
Kathy and Karl got a K on the shelf
I'm in DeKalb County open-carryin', caterin' chef
Cookin' up another plate of the best
Me and Christo got it poppin' like its Crisco
Fried chicken I'm lickin' her thighs, then I put my face in her breast
I took a drive, my plug on the west side of Atlanta
He known to finesse guys, wit' a hammer on Campbellton
Headshots on the camera, knock out a dreadlock
That's a felony charge, he caught a F
Niggas corner the A and get X'd out (X)
But I only been here 'cause I'm tryna help
Only one you can help is yourself now
Niggas say that I can't, damn lie
Ain't dappin' no hand, sanitize
I'm gon slide on your man, landslide
There's a 9 in my pants, hand cock
You gon' try to recant, you can't now
I could step on a ant, ant pile
I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now, dan-, dan-, dan-
Oh what a handsome gift, to live in a land of sin
Runnin' with bands and bricks, and my lil' nasty chick
That's what I asked of him, told me he'd grant my wish
You dance with the devil, you never dance again
Dance now, dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now
Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now
Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now
Dan-, dan-, dan-
Life is a journey, ya know? Not a destination
Lean not towards the egoistic intonations
Positive vibrations bring real liberation
It's the will of the heart, the strength of the mind
And the love of the creator that will help us
Rise outta these sadistic situations
And experience the purity that exists in a creation, you know?
