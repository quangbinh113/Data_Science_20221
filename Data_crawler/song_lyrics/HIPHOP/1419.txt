Song Name: Drive The Boat
Tell 'em drive the boat
Chokin' on Henny
Tell 'em drive the boat
Wait, woo back baby, wait
Tell 'em drive the boat
Tilt your head back baby
Tell 'em drive the boat
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Look, she fell in love with the woos
She off that 1942
She walk in the room, she picking and choosing
I'm the one she chose
She feeling tipsy
I'm 'bout to suck on her titty
I'm in all the stores, if I got it, I spend it
Said I hop in a Wraith
Couple thots in the Wraith
Race, I do the dash on the jakes
Taste, yeah she love how I taste
I bolted straight after I nut on her face
She smoking opps to the face
Tell 'em drive the boat
Chokin' on Henny
Tell 'em drive the boat
Wait, woo back baby, wait
Tell 'em drive the boat
Tilt your head back baby
Tell 'em drive the boat
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
If she suck it proper, then she get Chanel
I'm fresh out on bail
She love that Casa Azul
Her pussy wet like a pool
I'll have a Perc for dinner
Sinna, winna, Pop Smoke, killin'
I look at the opps like, damn homie
You used to be the man, homie
You was smoking all that shit
Now you a fan homie
Woo with me, I ain't twirlin'
Got your boo with me
Hundred thousand worth of jewelry
Drive the boat, act a fool with me
Tell 'em drive the boat
Chokin' on Henny
Tell 'em drive the boat
Wait, woo back baby, wait
Tell 'em drive the boat
Tilt your head back baby
Tell 'em drive the boat
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
