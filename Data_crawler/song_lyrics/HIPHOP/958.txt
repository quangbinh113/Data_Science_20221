Song Name: Hood Melody (feat. Youngboy Never Broke Again)
G-got it on smash
OG Parker
All of my youngins losing they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
People be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe he prolly can rap
He was on the block, they be movin' that work
Got what you need, he came from the dirt
Got it on lock, he don't wanna get murked
If somebody try me, I'ma put him on a shirt
I can't even see
They killin' each other off sh- from the earth
I got a bicky, I keep it with me
I never been shot, but I know that it hurt
N- killed my brother back in 2014
Streets know, but the 12 ruled a cold case
That was back in Pontiac, in my old place
N- never really make it to an old age
I gotta bring my B- when I wear my jewelry
'Cause I do not know what they thinkin'
People be plotting on me when I'm blinking
I be too paranoid, b- I be tweaking
I be too paranoid (paranoid, paranoid)
I gotta move a certain way
Cannot be cool, don't feel a way
Not to be rude, but "Go away"
All of my youngins losing they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
People be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe he prolly can rap
He was on the block, they be movin' that work
He got what you need, he came from the dirt
Got it on lock, he don't wanna get murked
If somebody try me, I'ma put him on a shirt
I know they watchin', emotions run straight out the sack
Protecting myself in the trenches
I done came all this way
I grew strong from that pain and it hurt
Come around when they see me now
Know these n- just wanna see me down
Came in, she was lovin' me bad
She got her a baby, don't wanna be with me now
You ain't right and I see it written all in your eyes
Tell no lies
Yeah, I bey you wanna f- with me now
I ain't make it home, then the sun go down
In the matter of some seconds, then you call my phone
And my past be the reason I ain't never slowin' down
Mastermind how to put another-
In the car, I'm rolling with seventy-something rounds
Put the Rollie to her ear, let her check for the sound
Ain't no tickin', I been standing on business
Got it jumpin' out the kitchen
Them mechanics steady smoking out the pound
Slimes with me, got a 30 in the glizzy
And you know I'm sippin', but gonna need another- by tomorrow
Keep my fingers clean, got pre-rolls, I'm a stoner
They stepped on Elijah but they on the corner
All of my young niggas losing they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
People be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe he prolly can rap
He was on the block, they be movin' that work
He got what you need, he came from the dirt
Got it on lock, he don't wanna get murked
If somebody try me, I'ma put him on a shirt
Shorty was with me and I got her lit
But I heard she be hoppin' from- to a-
But I'm not trippin', I know how it get
I am not puttin' my trust in no-
Can't leave the crib without bringing my st-
Got too much money, I'm rich than a-
They killed my brother, that sh- got me sick
Soon as they free him, I'm gettin' him hit
I made it out
People had faded out
They never came around
F- what they sayin' now
Watch who you hang around
Keep you a thang around
Ain't no more swangin' now
Just sprayin' now
I don't know sh-, I ain't do it
I just rap, I influence
They just wanna know what I'm doin'
Made it out the hood, I'm coolin'
All of my youngings losing they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
People be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe he prolly can rap
He was on the block, they be movin' that work
He got what you need, he came from the dirt
Got it on lock, he don't wanna get murked
If somebody try me, I'ma put him on a shirt
