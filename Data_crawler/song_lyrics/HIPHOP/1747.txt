Song Name: Issa Photoshoot
Huh (it's a Scalez track, ayy, tell 'em run that)
It's Gucci
(Big Chant, T Kee with the sauce)
Big Chant (AJ ruin everything he in)
Go
Ayy, Big Chant got so much stamina, I love fuckin' on camera (flash)
Ferrari, it's a Spider, so I call that bitch tarantula (skrrt)
I'm smokin' on some shit called Pastry
My bitch look like Angela (phew)
Any nigga play with me, I promise I'ma handle him
I ain't ready yet, I'm slippin' on my Gucci set
My trick bought me a new Patek
I hope he don't think he gettin' no sex (bling, blaow)
Only thing I want is neck
Breakin' these niggas, tryna see who next
Only nigga my type gon' spend that check
Who want take me to Wafi and bust my neck (spend that shit)
I need a nigga who gon' pop it 'til I tell him, "Stop it"
He ain't gon' play 'cause he know that I'm poppin'
He know I got options
My diamonds hittin' like they boxin', they say, "Chant obnoxious"
Roll this nigga up like he exotic, nigga say I'm toxic
When I step, I put it on, it's a photoshoot
When I'm in the mall, it's a photoshoot
When I'm in the club, it's a photoshoot
Red beam, ain't no flash, but when it's on, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot, girl, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot, girl, it's a photoshoot
When I'm with my bitches in the zone, it's a photoshoot
Red beam, ain't no flash, but when it's on, it's a photoshoot (go)
Every time my whips come out, it's a photoshoot (yeah)
My life a video, I'm dead fresh in the vocal booth (fresh)
I hit the mall, they takin' pics like it's a photoshoot (yeah)
I tried to hide, but with the Jacob, they gon' notice you (skrrt)
O to 100 real quick, that's what this Lotus do (zoom)
We international, but y'all just a lil' local crew (well, damn)
I'm so lit, I charge 100 for an interview (wow)
You wanna talk for free? Must don't know who you talkin' to (no)
I bring my lil' boy to the job and that's a photoshoot (ice)
He got a Patek, ain't even two, that's what I'm 'posed to do (burr)
The paparazzi cameras flash, so let me pose for you (yeah)
I know my foes watchin' my page 'cause that's what hoes will do (it's Gucci)
When I step, I put it on, it's a photoshoot
When I'm in the mall, it's a photoshoot
When I'm in the club, it's a photoshoot
Red beam, ain't no flash, but when it's on, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot, girl, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot, girl, it's a photoshoot
When I'm with my bitches in the zone, it's a photoshoot
Red beam, ain't no flash, but when it's on, it's a photoshoot
