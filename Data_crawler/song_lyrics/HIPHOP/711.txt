Song Name: A Woman
And to think

That a woman

A woman that I love so dear
Could make me sicker to my stomach, woah-oh
And to think I walked a thousand miles
Down this lonely road, baby, uh-oh (Damn)
My heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Oh, oh-oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Uh-oh
And to think, think about it
Just to think a woman, woah-ooh
That could ever make me feel this low
For things that I didn' do
So tell me, baby, I need to know
Is this how you comin'?
My heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Uh-oh
I was trippin', I was sippin' on some lean, uh
Stampede comin' while I walk out the arena
On a phone call with you, tryna make the team 'cause
All these birds on me, you could hear the chirp on me
I was cruisin' through the city in the G63, oh
Lookin' for somebody but I found it when I seen her
In the H-Town, my baby, you was D'up
Spotted me, was coolin' in my jewelry, I'm freeze up
Know you wanna fuck with me, what's up with ya?
The last thing I wanna hear is, "It's a dub with ya"
I know the people 'round you don't wanna see me with ya
But they don't give you dick and plus, I'm richer
I put my heart in your hands
Hopin' you'd hold me once again
How could you do the things you did?
Knowin' my heart burns for you like it did
You can come home
Come home, I'll welcome you in with open arms
You can always come back (You can always come back)
You can always come back (You can always come back)
Come home to me, uh (You can always come back)
Just come home to me (You can always come back)
You can always (You can always come back)
Always come back to me (You can always come back)
