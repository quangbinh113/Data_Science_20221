Song Name: Lion Eyes
You off them drugs, you think you macho, you gon' slide tonight
I know you will, you ain't gon' kill if someone die tonight
Off these drugs with all my niggas, that's the vibe tonight
If you gon' claim what bronem claim, you gotta provide 'em right
Right now, if he caught a case, would you have him right?
I done got so big, I can't enjoy my private life
They say I'm crazy, but I ain't never show up at a candlelight
But I'm like JJ with this gun, this shit like a dynamite
Got my first pound, I felt like Pablo
I had one gun with two shells in it, I was macho
Did Rolling Loud inside an orange bubble Milano
First rapper from Chicago drinkin' lean in Roscoe's
If I fly you out to Atlanta, shake that ass and toss it up
I got my grill cleaned a couple days ago, they say I floss too much
I know how it feel to lose it all because I lost too much
Got in that room and told it all, I knew 'cause you talk too much
'Cause everything that shine like diamonds ain't no diamonds
A lot of people claim they real, they don't be lyin'
I be takin' the smallest drugs, I'm feelin' giant
The way I'm mixin' pop and lean, I'm passin' science
The one that claim I can't be quiet, she triflin'
Keep my mind clear 'cause I just say it, don't write it
I got the eye of a lion
And the heart of a tiger
Dropped, "Made It Out", I had the trenches all on fire
We really bang bros, how the fuck we did Mariah?
Ain't do too much when Fredo died, we torched them lighters
I missed the one's that's now deceased that I knew since the diapers
I know some niggas play with guns, but known for the fightin'
You try to flame up weed on jets, you gotta watch the pilots
Wakin' up to different sirens
(I really got the heart of tigers)
