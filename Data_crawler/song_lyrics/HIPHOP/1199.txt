Song Name: Pink Dolphin Sunset (feat. Tee)
Every time I close my eyes
It seems like nothing helps
Visions of you run my mind (run my mind)
I can't see nothing else, ooh
Every time I'm in my house
I just can't stop talkin' 'bout you, oh, yeah
Stunning girls and sexy smile, ooh
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my bae
'Cause I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
And I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
So, can we meet again?
If you give me a chance
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end (I can't feel my heart, yeah)
But can we meet again?
If you give me a chance
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end
Just say you want me (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
But you don't want me (wanna get with you, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (wanna get with you, baby)
Just say you want me (say you want me, girl) (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
But she don't want me (she don't want me) (wanna get with you)
That don't stop me, baby (that don't stop me) (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (that don't stop me) (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Every time that I see her (I see her)
Seems like she got a hold on me, uh
And every time that I need her (I need her)
She's there but really not there for me, ooh
Played my role and dealt my cards (dealt my cards)
I let her put it all on me, yeah
Things can only go so far, ooh
'Til one of us quits on three
But that'd be a tragedy, baby
'Cause I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
And I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
So, can we meet again? (Can we meet again?)
If you give me a chance (give me a chance)
I know the way this ends (yeah)
I'll get played in the end (I can't feel my heart, yeah)
But can we meet again?
If you give me a chance
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end (I can't feel my heart, yeah)
Can we meet again?
If you give me a chance
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end
Just say you want me (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
But you don't want me (wanna get with you, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (wanna get with you, baby)
Just say you want me (say you want me, girl) (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
But she don't want me (she don't want me) (wanna get with you, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (that don't stop me) (ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
That don't stop me, baby (that don't stop me) (wanna get with you, baby)
