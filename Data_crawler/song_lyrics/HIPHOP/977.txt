Song Name: PRESSURE
Hi, Kevin
I'm in, uh, a fucking
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Trench coat, uh, uh
Yeah, ay, yeah
Okay, under pressure momma, there go the kid (Ayy)
Nigga like me cannot fuck on no bitch (Ha-ha)
Black tint, black fit, shit
Rented cars, scammin', card flips (Yeah)
Kick a nigga ass, aw shit (Aw shit)
Bitches talkin' shit, nonsense
Fake shit all up in my conscience
Nigga stumble, crumble like a Ritz
Blade cut, slice your bitch hips (Ah)
Smoke a nigga like a fuckin' ash
Two twins, Mary-Kate, Ash (Yeah)
Two dicks up a bitches ass
My dick, my Glock, girl (Uh)
That's what I mean by that (Yeah)
Give you diamonds, give you fuckin' pearls (What's up?)
Two steps and then we fuck and twirl
Swindle my fingers through your curls (Ah)
Baby girl, you my fuckin' world (Uh)
You could leave 'cause you comin' back
I don't need you, bitch, get back (Uh-huh)
Put the money in the duffle bag
Off White, 'til it's off white (Yeah)
Need a cheese, let me take a bite (Uh)
Got the rocket, let me take flight
If you do decide to leave
You will not be allowed access back on board
And parachutes are not included
Ha-ha-ha
Fettuccine on my fucking plate (Ayy)
Gettin' money like Bill Gates (Yeah)
Bro caught a first soft me (Yeah)
Mix the lean with the soft drink (Ah)
Gold chains, keep a heart link
Nigga what you talking? What you think? (Ayy)
Big bank take lil' bank (Yeah)
Drippin' like the poland water spring
Diamonds ice cold, pinky ring (Bitch)
Niggas bitches use Maybelline
You a queen, bitch I'ma king
Okay, under pressure momma, there go the kid (Ayy)
Nigga like me cannot fuck on no bitch (Ha-ha)
Black tint, black fit, shit
Rented cars, scammin', card flips (Yeah)
Kick a nigga ass, aw shit (Aw shit)
Bitches talkin' shit, nonsense
Fake shit all up in my conscience
Nigga stumble, crumble like a Ritz
Pussy-ass niggas, hah
Alright, it's over, hah, ha-ha
Let me hear it
