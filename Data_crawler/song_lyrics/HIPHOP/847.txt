Song Name: Beat Box 4 (with NLE Choppa)
Grrt (come on)
Ayy, walk 'em down straight to the ground
We make sure that he don't get up (damn E, this shit exclusive)
Call the reverend and his momma
Tell 'em, "Come and pick 'em up" (come and pick 'em up)
I'ma smack you with this .40, askin', "Is my Glizzy tucked?" (Is my Glizzy tucked?)
Only like it sloppy, she gon' beatbox when she suckin' me (come on, come on)
Told her, "Bring a friend", if she ever think about fuckin' me
Touchin' who? Touchin' me? To God where your ass gon' be (prr)
Leave him stuck and send him up like he fuckin' with Cardi B (prr, prr, prr)
Park the car before we hit the street, I'm hoppin' out on feet (I'm better)
Get up close so I can see his teeth but I'ma keep it brief
Ask do he remember me, then introduced him to my heat
Skrrt off the block, you followin' this car, your whip be cream cheese (come here, prr)
Ain't no bush to beat around, you not duckin' no hundred rounds
Whole hood been down, fuck the count 'cause we just beat it down ('cause we just beat it down)
Ain't gotta spin back around because my target hit the ground (my target hit the ground)
Crossed that line, you out of bounds, they gon' find you up in the crowd
Nappy-ass dreadlocks, black Forces, black socks (ayy, ayy, prr)
Make the Draco pop, it's louder than a boombox (prr-prr, prr-prr)
Shoutout to OVO, this Drac' can make your bed rock (make your bed rock)
We beat them four and oh, just check the score, it say a lot (ayy, check the score)
Ayy, I'm in Miami, she givin' me head on Ocean Drive while her nigga outside
Sucked me so good, I thought that I died but when I nutted, I had came back alive
Skeet on her face, it got in her eyes, now she tellin' me she legally blind
Gave her a towel and told her she fine, she kept suckin' 'til she started cryin'
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot 'em, I got 'em (come on, come on, come on)
He started runnin', so I caught 'em (ayy), bag on his head, I bought 'em (ayy)
Told my shooter do everything that I taught him (ayy)
Let me know if it's a problem
Like a school boy, I be super quick to solve it
Thinkin' my shooter retarded, he take a pill and then snort it right off of his .40
Snort it right off of his gun
Shot a hundred, then paid a hundred for his bond (yo, yo)
Send a diss, I won't respond (no)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (come on)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (come on, come on)
Let a nigga come and play
He gon' tell his momma, "Plan the funeral date" (prr-prr)
I got the power like Nelson Mandela (prr-prr-prr)
You need a umbrella whenever I spray (whenever I spray)
Leave him shitty like Nutella, he gon' need a Pamper if he survive this K
Me and my niggas, we down for whatever, we step on whoever in retro J's (Retro J's)
Bullet, stick like a thorn, call it Bella, make him Cinderella if he betray, bitch
Bu-bu-burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box
In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big goon shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sense
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobe, 24 on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan 'til they got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless
Bu-bu-burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thu-thu-thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box
