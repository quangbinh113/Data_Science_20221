Song Name: KAZINO
Dice and ice cube, 여기 너무 위험해
Homegirls, bitches 카드를 막 섞네
Spin it, spin it, pussy들 다 보내
Chips and chips and chips and 목숨을 거네
나는 여기를 걸고 쟤는 저년을 걸고
Demon under the table 말을 걸고
Risk it, risk it, risk it 'til the last dime
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Risk it, risk it, risk it 'til the last
Bi-bi-bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, bitches, risk it 'til the last dime
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Vodka in my cup 빙빙 도는
Spin it, tip it, strip it, shawty
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Taste the muzzle of a gun, taste the 맛 of money
You think I'm dazzled up, my 땅 tie that bitch, ain't funny
공놀이 잠 못 드는 밤 찾을 걸 돈에 깔려 죽은 나
다음 chips 또 다음 checks 다음 matches and 다음 chicks
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Risk it, risk it, risk it 'til the last dime
Bi-bi-bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, bitches, risk it 'til the last dime
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Vodka in my cup 빙빙 도는
Spin it, tip it, strip it, shawty
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Said that I mean it, way for the willing
카드를 집어 날 구원해 주길
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Vodka in my cup 빙빙 도는
Spin it, tip it, strip it, shawty
Give me that, hook that, spin that roulette
Bi-bi-bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, ice and homegirl, you home, homegirl
Bitches, bitches, bitches, homegirls
