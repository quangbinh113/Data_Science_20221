Song Name: A$$A$$IN
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I, we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like an assassin
The dark is where you lie
It's hello and it's goodbye
Oldest story ever told
Hold me 'til we both go cold
Yeah, I'm on the edge, but I'm not quite critical
Now you're in my head like a lovesick criminal
And it's the same shit every time
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I, we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like an assassin
You make it hard to breathe
Another ace up your sleeve
Your fingerprints on the weapon
I'm never gonna learn my lesson
So do your worst and for God's sake, finish it
I'm addicted to your type of punishment
And it's the same shit every time
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I, we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like an assassin
(Fell in love with the ways that you kill me)
(Do or die, you and I, we're guilty)
I-I-I should've known better from the last time
Y-Y-You said you won't come back again, but
Now I know better for the next time
When you come crying
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I, we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like an assassin
You kill me
Take me down like an assassin
