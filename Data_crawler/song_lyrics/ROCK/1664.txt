Song Name: I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE (with Iggy Pop)
I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
I wanna be your good boy, I wanna be your gangster
'Cause you can be the beauty and I could be the monster
I love you since this morning, not just for aesthetic
I wanna touch your body, so fucking electric
I know you're scared of me, you said I'm too eccentric
I'm crying all my tears and that's fucking pathetic
I wanna make you hungry, then I wanna feed ya
I wanna paint your face like you're my Mona Lisa
I wanna be a champion, I wanna be a loser
I'll even be a clown 'cause I just wanna amuse ya
I wanna be your sex toy, I wanna be your teacher
I wanna be your sin, I wanna be a preacher
I wanna make you love me, then I wanna leave ya
'Cause baby, I'm your David and you're my Goliath, uh-huh
Alright, okay
Because I'm the devil who's searching for redemption
And I'm a lawyer who's searching for redemption
I'm a killer who's searching for redemption
I'm a fucking monster who's searching for redemption
I'm a bad guy who's searching for redemption
And I'm a blonde girl who's searching for redemption
I'm a freak who is searching for redemption
I'm a fucking monster who's searching for redemption
Redemption
I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
I wanna be your good boy, I wanna be your gangster
'Cause you can be the beauty and I could be the monster
I wanna make you quiet, I wanna make you nervous
I wanna set you free but I'm too fucking jealous
I wanna pull your strings like you're my Telecaster
And if you want to use me, I could be your puppet
'Cause I'm the devil who's searching for redemption
And I'm a lawyer who's searching for redemption
And I'm a killer who's searching for redemption
I'm a motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption
Yeah
Okay
And I could be the monster
I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
