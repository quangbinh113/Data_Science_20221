Song Name: Proud Mary
You know, every now and then I think you might like to hear
Somethin' from us, nice and easy
There's just one thing you see
We never, ever do nothin' nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
But we're gonna take the beginning of this song and do it easy
But then we're gonna do the finish rough
That's the way we do Proud Mary
And we're rolling (Ooh), rolling (Ooh), rolling on the river
Listen to the story
Left a good job in the city (Down in the city)
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleep
(And I was) Worryin' about the way that things might have been
(You know that) Big wheel keep on turnin
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (Rollin')
Rollin' yeah (Rollin'), rollin' on the river (Rollin' on the river)
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
(You know I) And I pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of that city until I hitched
A ride on the river boat Queen
(You know the) Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (Rollin')
Rollin' yeah (Rollin'), rollin' on the river (Rollin' on the river)
Said we're rollin' (Rollin')
Rollin' yeah (Rollin'), rollin' on the river (Rollin' on the river)
I left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleep
Worryin' about the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin' (Turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (Burnin')
Rollin'
Rollin', rollin' on the river
Said we're rollin'
Rollin', rollin' on the river
Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city until I hitched
A ride on the river boat Queen
Big wheel keep on turnin' (Turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (Burnin')
And we're rollin'
Said we're rollin', we're rollin' on the river
I tell ya we're rollin'
Rollin', we're rollin' on the river
Alright, yeah
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you come down to the river
I betcha you're gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry
If you got no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turnin' (Turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (Burnin')
And we're rollin'
And we're rollin'
And we're rollin' on a river
Tell me one more time
Rollin' (Yeah)
Rollin' (Alright)
Rollin' on the river (Ooh yeah)
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river (Yeah, alright now)
We're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Said we're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
I tell you we're rollin', we're rollin', we're rollin' on the river
Yeah, alright, uh-huh
