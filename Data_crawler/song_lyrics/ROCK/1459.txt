Song Name: My Generation - Stereo Version
People try to put us d-down (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die before I get old (talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all f-fade away (talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try dig what we all s-s-say (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big s-s-sensation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all f-fade away (talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try d-dig what we all s-s-say (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my g-generation
My, my, my, my, my generation
People try to put us d-down (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-get around (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Yeah, I hope I die before I get old (talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my, my, my, my generation (generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (talkin' about)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (my generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (my generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (this is my generation, baby)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (this is my generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (this is my generation)
Talkin' 'bout my generation (this is my generation)
