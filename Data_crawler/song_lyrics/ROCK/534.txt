Song Name: Back on the Chain Gang - 2007 Remaster
I found a picture of you, oh-oh
Well, it hijacked my world at night
To a place in the past we've been cast out of, oh-oh
Now we're back in the fight
We're back on the train, yeah
Oh, back on the chain gang
Circumstance beyond our control, oh-oh
The phone, the TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh-oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
Put us back on the train, yeah
Oh, back on the chain gang
The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part
I found a picture of you, oh-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart
Now I'm back on the train, yeah
Oh, back on the chain gang
