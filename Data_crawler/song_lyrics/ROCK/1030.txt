Song Name: Comin' Home - Live From MTV Unplugged/1995
It's been a month or two since I was sleepin' with you
I'm comin' home again
I've been to east and west but baby I like best
The road that leads to you
Oh girl
It seems the whole wide world
Seems to say
Hotels that all look the same
Just seem to drive me insane
But I can't get away
Until I receive a call
That tells me that'll be all
And then I hop a plane
It's true
I'm not sure if you knew
I'm comin' home to you
Oh girl
It seems the whole wide world
Seems to say
Hotels that all look the same
Just seem to drive me insane
But I can't get away
Until I receive a call
That tells me that'll be all
And then I hop a plane
It's true
I'm not sure if you knew
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home, baby
