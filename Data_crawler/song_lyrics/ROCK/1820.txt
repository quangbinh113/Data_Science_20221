Song Name: Play Ball
Listen
Pick me up
Fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said it's party time
When I'm on the loose
Make it feel alright
(Listen) Drinks all around
I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine
Let's play ball
Shootin' down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball, baby
Battin' down the stalls
Play, play, play ball
Listen Sid
Light me up
I'm in love
I'm off the leash and unbound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud
Let's play ball
Shooting down the wall, yeah
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball
Hit that thing right here
Hey, yeah
It's a home run
Let's play ball
Shooting at a wall
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stall
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball
