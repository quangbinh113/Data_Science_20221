Song Name: House Of Blue Lights
Pull up your jeans and we will truck on down
A knocked out joint at the edge of town
A real homecoming for all you cats
You keep a-walking 'til you see that welcome mat
Fall in there, lose your lead
At the house, the house of blue lights
Well, we have the time and we'll cut a rug
You dig that jive like it should be dug
A real homecoming for all the cats
You keep a-walking 'til you see that welcome mat
Drop-in there, get your lead
At the house, the house of blue lights
Fryers, broilers, Detroit barbecued ribs
You get the hit of the week
But when you dig that real fine jive
With the welcome beat
Fall in there, lose your lead
At the house, the house of blue lights
Fryers, broilers, Detroit barbecued ribs
You get the treat of the week
But when you dig that real fine jive
With the welcome beat
Fall in there, lose your lead
At the house, the house of blue lights
