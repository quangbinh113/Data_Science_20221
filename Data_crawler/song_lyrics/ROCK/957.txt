Song Name: Action - Revised Version
So you think you'll take another piece of me
To satisfy your intellectual need
Do you want, do you want
Action?
Gonna bring you down
'Cause you're pushin' me
You gotta recognize my superiority
Liar, liar
Liar, liar
You know you believed it
Liar, liar
Liar, liar
'Cause I'm the main man
And that's why
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
Everybody wants a piece of the action
I was suicidal 'cause she was my idol
Baby, baby, baby, bring it to your knees
Well there was a time I would have walked the line
Don't you bring me down
With your insatiable greed
Liar, liar
Liar, liar
You know you believed it
Liar, liar
Liar, liar
'Cause I'm the main man
And that's why
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Do you want?
Action!! Action!!
Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Action
Action
Action
Action
Action
