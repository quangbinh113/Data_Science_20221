Song Name: Humanity
Humanity, auf wiedersehen
It's time to say goodbye, the party's over
As the laughter dies, an angel cries
Humanity, it's au revoir to your insanity
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies
You're a drop in the rain
Just a number, not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it
Humanity, humanity
Goodbye, goodbye
Be on your way, adios amigo
There's a price to pay
For all the egotistic games you played
The world you made is gone

You're a drop in the rain
Just a number not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it
Humanity, humanity
Goodbye, goodbye
Run and hide
There's fire in the sky (stay inside)
The water's gonna rise and pull you under
In your eyes I'm staring at the end of time
Nothing can change us
No one can save us from ourselves
You're a drop in the rain
Just a number not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it
Humanity, humanity, humanity
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
