Song Name: Breakn' a Sweat
All right this is the breakdown
I'm breakin'a sweat
It's all right
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's all right
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's all right
I'm breakin' a sweat
Come on baby light my fire
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's all right
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's all right
Breakin' a sweat

Woo! That's good, that's all right
