Song Name: Cool Cat - Remastered 2011
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're taking all my sunshine away
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)
'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart, yeah
You used to be a mean kid
Ooh, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping
And waiting to really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding to fast, slow down
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh, ooh, feeling, feeling
Feeling ev'ry feeling
