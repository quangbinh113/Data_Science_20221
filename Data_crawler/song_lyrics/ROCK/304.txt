Song Name: Let It Sink
Disintegrate into water
I let you slip away
Hands are cold and frozen
But I feel you all the same
Cause I pull my teeth
When I hear you speak
Does it matter now
That you're not around
Don't tell me it's how it's
Supposed to be
Cause I let it sink
Like a pendulum
Couldn't stop the swing
Is it better now
Behind the ceiling
Cause I pull my teeth
When I hear you speak
Does it matter now
That you're not around
Don't tell me it's how it's
Supposed to be
I let it sink
Hushed with a finger
You took me to my grave
It's cold and lonely
But I kind of like it that way
Hushed with a finger
You took me to my grave
It's cold and lonely
But I kind of like it that way
Like a pendulum
I let it swing
I let it sink
Like a pendulum
I let it swing
I let it sink
Cause I let it sink
Cause I let it sink
