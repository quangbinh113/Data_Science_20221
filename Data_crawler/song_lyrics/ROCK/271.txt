Song Name: MODERN META MEDICINE (feat. Jesse Leach of Killswitch Engage)
(One, two)
(Fuck you)
Self-serve, it's all that you can eat
How will we pay? We're the commodity
We can never help ourselves
We want it all and nothing else
Market plan: Consume, buy everything
Create desires and trade them publicly
The sweet smell of our excess
We choke and gag upon the stench
Every dime spared from the war fund
Another pill for us to choke on
On and on and on and on
Wе're never right, wе're never wrong
And on and on and on and on
What's black is white, what's true is false
Take off my weary head (fill us with medicine)
We're all bogged down with dread (fill us with medicine)
Fill us with medicine
Under-treat the pain, deny dignity
Subhuman graves robbed for the body
Indelible memory remains
The histories of abuse and shame
Same story, the character a caricature
A premium paid, a misery ensured
Shocked by the inhumanity
Is this life of ours worth anything
Every dime spared from the war fund
Another pill for us to choke on
On and on and on and on
We're never right, we're never wrong
And on and on and on and on
What's black is white, what's true is false
Take off my weary head (fill us with medicine)
We're all bogged down with dread (fill us with medicine)
Fill us with medicine
So we get (get, get) what we deserve
So we try (try, try) to bereave the interred
So we get what we deserve
This modern medicine
This modern meta medicine (so let us in)
This modern meta medicine (so let us in)
This modern meta medicine (so let us in, medicine)
This modern meta medicine (so let us in, medicine)
(Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
