Song Name: Times Like These
It's nights like this, under a harvest moon
It came too fast and it's gone too soon
A wilted rose and a frozen tomb
A memory for the wind
Anyway, does anybody notice that the sky is falling?
Are we all just happy in the rain?
Am I the only one who hears the sirens calling?
Am I the only one who feels the pain?
It's times like these
When the sorrow shadows all the laughter
Times like these
When the hurt goes on and on forever
Times like these
I wanna fade away

I read all the pages from left to right
I took one in the morning and one at night
The fire still burns, but it's cold inside
It's all that I can do
Anyway, no one wants to talk about the end is coming
Pointing fingers, handing out the blame
If I gave you answers to all your questions
Could you change, or would you stay the same?
'Cause it's times like these
When left is right and forward's backwards
Times like these
When days and nights just roll together
Times like these
I wanna fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Times like these (like these)
I wanna fade away (fade away)
In times like these (like these)
Times like these
'Cause it's times like these
When the sorrow shadows all the laughter
Times like these
When it seems like nothing worse can happen
Times like these
It's times like these
I wanna fade away
It's times like these (like these)
I wanna fade away (fade away)
It's times like these (like these)
In times like these
