Song Name: Lucy
I exit in through my mind, no pain (no pain)
Breaking through, I'm falling
Synergetic with the night and day
Duality, I'm floating
I'm lit up by the substance of reality
All that's inside of me
Dissolve this, take me away
Separate truth from my brain
Body and soul, we'll find the strength to let go
I'ma take you outta here
I'm calling
When I need you here with me
I close my eyes and feel release
Liberate me from my beliefs
I'm calling
My body aches from the distance
When I'm far away from you
The world is bigger when I can't see your eyes
Privilege, strip the gold from my bones, yeah
Silver blood won't save you from discovering fear and love
I know you're searching for outta here
But you've found it
And it's right between your eyes
Seasons come and they roll past
Time flies
I've been waiting to go
I'm calling
When I need you here with me
I close my eyes and feel release
Liberate me from my beliefs
I'm calling
My body aches from the distance
When I'm far away from you
The world is bigger when I can't see your eyes
Ooh, the tunnels through me
Will empty me and let me go
I was sick, but I am safe
The energy glued to my fate
I never needed all this weight
Dissolve me and take my name
I was sick, I am healing, running home
We all forget where we came from
When we are sick, but we are safe
I'm calling
When I need you here with me
I close my eyes and feel release
Liberate me from my beliefs
I'm calling
My body aches from the distance
When I'm far away from you
The world is bigger when I can't see your eyes
Privilege, strip the gold from my bones
Silver blood won't save you from discovering fear and love
