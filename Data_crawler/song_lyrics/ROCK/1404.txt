Song Name: Tax Free - Live at the Los Angeles Forum, Inglewood, CA - April 26, 1969
Everyday in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square
Hey!
And that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be down I gotta move, hey
Stone free, just do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away, hey
Alright, listen to this baby
A woman here, a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh but sometimes I get a ha, feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught
And that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down, I gotta be free
I said, â€½Stone free, just do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to, got to get away, yeah
Tear me loose babyâ€
Yeah!
Stone free, to ride on the breeze
Stone free, do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
Stone free, I got to, I got to get away
Stone free, I go on take a ride now
Stone free, don't try to hold me back
Stone free, I go on down the highway, now
Stone free, got to, got to, got to, got to
Stone free, bye bye baby
