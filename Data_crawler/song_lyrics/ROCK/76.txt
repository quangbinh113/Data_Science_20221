Song Name: Devil
How the fuck is one so evil left to just proceed?
All the luck and how deceitful that idle minds can be
Farewell to vanished fraud
So here comes the fall, your blood has all been washed away
(Oh-oh-oh)
You left with a crawl, the end was worth the wasted days
The devil lies alone
Come sell me useless greed and swindle lie and cheat
'Cause nothing matters when the truth is only obsolete
Farewell to vanished fraud
So here comes the fall, your blood has all been washed away
(Oh-oh-oh)
You left with a crawl, the end was worth the wasted days
The devil lies alone
So here comes the fall, your blood has all been washed away
(Oh-oh-oh)
You left with a crawl, the end was worth the wasted days
The devil lies alone
So here comes the fall, your blood has all been washed away
(Oh-oh-oh)
You left with a crawl, the end was worth the wasted days
The devil lies alone
