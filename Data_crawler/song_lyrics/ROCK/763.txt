Song Name: Wasting Love - 2015 Remaster
Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up 'til now I'm doing the best I can

Long roads, long days
Of sunrise to sunset, of sunrise to sunset
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
