Song Name: The Messenger
When you feel you're alone
Cut off from this cruel world
Your instinct's telling you to run
Listen to your heart
Those angel voices
They'll sing to you
They'll be your guide
Back home
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind
When you've suffered enough
And your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember, you're loved
And you always will be
This melody will bring you right
Back home
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
