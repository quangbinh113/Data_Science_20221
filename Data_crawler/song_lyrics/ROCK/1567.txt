Song Name: The KKK Took My Baby Away - 2002 Remaster
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
Hey ho, hey ho
I don't know
Where my baby can be
They took her from me
They took her from me
I don't know
Where my baby can be
They took her from me
They took her from me
Ring me, ring me, ring me
Up the President
And find out
Where my baby went
Ring me, ring me, ring me
Up the FBI
And find out if
My baby's alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
O-o-o-o o-o
O-o-o-o o-o
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took my girl
They took my baby away
