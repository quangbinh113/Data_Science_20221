Song Name: Sure Know Something
I've been up and down
I've been all around
I was mystified
Almost terrified
But late at night I still hear you
Call my name
I've been on my own
I've been all alone
I was hypnotized
I felt paralyzed
But late at night I still want you
Just the same

I've been a gambler but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never told me at school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, uh huh
I was seventeen
You were just a dream
I was mesmerized
I felt scared inside
You broke my heart and I still can
Feel the pain
I've been carried out
I've had fear and doubt
I've been starry eyed, never satisfied
'Cause late at night I still need you
Just the same (just the same)
I've been a gambler but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never told me at school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, uh huh
I've been carried out
I've had fear and doubt
I've been starry eyed
Never satisfied
'Cause late at night I still need you
Just the same (just the same)
I've been a gambler but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never told me in school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can tell me till I hear it from you
And I sure know something, sure know something
I've been a gambler but I'm nobody's fool
I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never told me at school
And I sure know something, sure know something
