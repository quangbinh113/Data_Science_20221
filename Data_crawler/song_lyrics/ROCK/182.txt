Song Name: Tear It Down
A stranger's knocking
Leave me alone
Mindless persistence
Has cut me to the bone
Turned on the television
It took away my breath
But I won't let it sell me
That I was "scared to death"
(I'm not a robot)
(I'm not a clone)
(You build the rocket)
(I'll drive it home)
(My eyes are bleeding)
(Can't kill the sound)
(So, move the mountain)
Gonna take it, gonna break it, gonna
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want my friends to see
(Tear it down)
All my brothers just hear me now
No motherfucker gonna tell us how
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want the world to see
There's no time for waiting around
Tear it down
Big brother's watching
He's everywhere
But does he realize
The revolution's in the air
Are you still with me?
Are you alive?
Let's take this down stone by stone
And break it up before we die
(I'm not a robot)
(I'm not a clone)
(You build the rocket)
(I'll drive it home)
(My eyes are bleeding)
(Can't kill the sound)
(So, move the mountain)
Gonna take it, gonna break it, gonna
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want my friends to see
(Tear it down)
All my brothers just hear me now
No motherfucker gonna tell us how
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want the world to see
There's no time for waiting around
Tear it down
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want my friends to see
(Tear it down)
All my brothers just hear me now
No motherfucker gonna tell us how
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
(Right now)
I want the world to see
There's no time for waiting around
Oh, There's no time for waiting around
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
I want my friends to see
All my brothers just hear me now
No motherfucker gonna tell us how
(Tear it down)
No wall's too big for me
Tear It down
I want the world to see
All my brothers just hear me now
No motherfucker gonna tell us how
Tear It down
Tear It down
Tear It down
