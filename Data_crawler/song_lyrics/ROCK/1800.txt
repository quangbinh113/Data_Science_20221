Song Name: Those Shoes - 2013 Remaster
Tell us what you're gonna do tonight mama
There must be someplace you can go

In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're lookin' good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have somethin' to lose
Oh, no pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You got to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
All those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh, no you can't do that
Once you started wearin' those shoes
(Butt out)
(Butt out)
(Butt out)
(Butt out)
(Butt out butt out) They're lookin' at you leanin' on you
(Butt out butt out) Tell you anything you want to hear
(Butt out butt out) They give you tablets of love
(Butt out butt out)
(Butt out butt out) They're waiting for you got to score you
(Butt out butt out) Handy with a shovel and so sincere
(Butt out butt out) Ooh... they got the kid glove
(Butt out butt out)
You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna to get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no you can't do that
Once you started wearin' those shoes
Oh, no you can't do that
Once you started wearin' those shoes

(Butt out butt out)

Umm
(Butt out butt out)
Shoot
(Butt out butt out)
(Butt out butt out)
Whoa-whoa
(Butt out butt out)
(Butt out butt out)
(Butt out butt out)
(Butt out)
