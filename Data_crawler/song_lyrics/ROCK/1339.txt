Song Name: Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman) - Remaster
With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat

Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Alimony, alimony paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servantry
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
