Song Name: Know Your Rights - Remastered
This is a public service announcement
With guitar
Know your rights
All three of them
Number one
You have the right not to be killed
Murder Is a crime!
Unless it was done
By a policeman or an aristocrat
Know your rights
And number two
You have the right to food money
Providing of course
You don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation
Know your rights
These are your rights
Hey, say what, hey
Know these rights
Number three
You have the right to free speech
As long as you're not
Dumb enough to actually try it
Know your rights
These are your rights
Know your rights
These are your rights
All three of 'em
And it has been suggested
In some quarters that this is not enough
Well
Get off the streets
Get off the streets
Run
