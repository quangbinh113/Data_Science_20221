Song Name: White Room
In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place
Where that sun never shines
Wait in this place
Where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need, just beginning
I'll wait in the queue
When the trains come back
Lie with you
Where the shadows run from themselves
At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound, now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles, in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place
With the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark
Where the shadows run from themselves
