Song Name: Big Sur
Do do do do do do do do do
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowing from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff (Big Sur mount)
As a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
A mother deer with their newborn fawns
All under Big Sur skies (Big Sur mount)
That's where I belong
Do do do do do do do do do
Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers (Big Sur mount)
And live in canyons covered in springtime green
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar (Big Sur mount)
I'll make up songs to sing
Do do do do do do do do do
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river to the Oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide (Big Sur mount)
Do do do do do do do do do
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water (Big Sur mount)
And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire, I think I'll add a log (Big Sur mount)
Do do do do do do do do do
From time to time I must go away
The thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay
Away from Big Sur
Oh Big Sur
