Song Name: I'm A Rocker
You know sometimes I'm a rocker and sometimes I'm all a roller
I may go down sometimes but I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number one
We were rockin' and a rollin' and really havin' fun
I'm a rocker, yeah, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out the floor when they played number two
You know she claims she don't, but I know she do
I'm a rocker, yeah, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number three
And believe me, I was diggin' her and she was diggin' me
I'm a rocker, hey, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number four
She done freak me out and I was ready to go
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number five
I was lit up like a green light on a one-way drive
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number six
I was stone gettin' firm like a cement mix
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number seven
We caught a taxicab and told him to take us to heaven
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We were out on the floor when they played number eight
She was right on time and I wasn't a second late
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes, boy
I get it like I'm getting now, yeah aha
We were out on the floor when they played number ten
We had a coke, a cheeseburger, went and did it again
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
We was all freaked out when the band went down
And we all got together and went around and around
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I'll always come back rockin', rollin'
Rockin', rollin'
Rockin' and rollin' and really havin' fun
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I may go down sometimes
But I come back to rock and roller
