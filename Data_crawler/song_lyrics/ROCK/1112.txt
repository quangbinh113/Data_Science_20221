Song Name: Rock Believer
I'm a rock believer
You start to crawl until you walk
You make a scream and learn to talk
You discover life on every day
From the first day you were born
You walked a lifeline of your own
And if you always keep the faith
No one can take your dreams away
In the ruins of their souls
You saw the beauty of it all
Simply a generation change
How our fathers came to steal
But we came back to make you feel
Our love in every song we play
Scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
Come on, scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
We go from here to everywhere
So many moments that we share
All boarded up, we give and take
Love came to me so many ways
No matter what some haters say
No one can take our dreams away
Scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
Come on, scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
Scream, scream, scream (I'm a rock believer)
Scream, scream, scream (I'm a rock believer)
No one can take our dreams away
No one can take our dreams away
Scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
Come on, scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you
Scream, scream, scream (I'm a rock believer)
Scream, scream, scream (I'm a rock believer)
Scream, scream, scream (I'm a rock believer)
Scream, scream, scream
