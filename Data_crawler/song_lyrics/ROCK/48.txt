Song Name: you're not special
Oh, did I push you over the edge?
Did someone wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
I heard you screamin' that you want me dead
Is that what the voice says inside of your head?
You're gonna burst, so full of spite
Like I'm your personal parasite
I'll play the villain in your life
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You think you're special to me
You think you can get under my skin
You stick your knife right through me
So dull that I don't feel a thing
I don't hate you, I don't care like that
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that?
I'm starrin' in your movie
But you're not that special to me
You're not that special
Unhealthy obsession, you're really attached
Should probably have somebody look at that
I don't know how you let it get this bad
Jealous I've got all the things that you lack
You think you're special to me
You think you can get under my skin
You stick your knife right through me
So dull that I don't feel a thing
I don't hate you, I don't care like that
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that?
I'm starrin' in your movie
But you're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
You think you're special to me
You think you can get under my skin
You stick your knife right through me
So dull that I don't feel a thing
I don't hate you, I don't care like that
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that?
I'm starrin' in your movie
But you're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
You're not that special to me
