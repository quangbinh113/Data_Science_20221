Song Name: Don't Stop Me Now - ...Revisited
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel Ah-lih-lih-live
And the world
I'll turn it inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy, so
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time!
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go-go-GO
There's no stopping me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call!
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all
Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite; I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh (I like it!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ahhhhhh ...
(Alright)
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I want to make a supersonic man outta you
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you want to have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all .
La da-da-da-da daah
Da da da haa
Ha da-da, ha, ha, Haaa
Ha da daa
Ha da da aaa(h) ...
