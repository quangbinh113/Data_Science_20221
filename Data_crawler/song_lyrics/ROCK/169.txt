Song Name: Don't Pray For Me
"Will all who wish to die please raise their hands"
I'm lost in the dark
I'm not blind to what I see
I know the river is wide and the water is deep
I feel the cold, my heart skips a beat
I don't need your absolution, so don't hold that sword over me
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts
Don't pray for me, no ("will all who wish to die please raise their hands")
I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me
Oh, I needed a revolution
I never had a war in mind
And now the river runs dry and the fall is deep
The truth is dark and makes us bleed
In hell is where I stand, it's where I find my inner strength
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts
Don't pray for me, no
I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me
I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me
