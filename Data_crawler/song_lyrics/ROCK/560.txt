Song Name: Fell On Black Days
Whatsoever I've feared has come to life
And whatsoever I've fought off, became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded, now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time
'Cause I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days (black days)
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
Searchlight so they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right
'Cause I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days (black days)
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
So what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours, just made it mine
So don't you lock up something that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying
No, not tying
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
But I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
I sure don't mind a change
