Song Name: Some Things Never Change
Did you hold on tight for a cold day
Or are we just falling out again, out again
Do you feel better than you did before
Did you find what you were looking for
Do you still want more
If I fall on a good day
Would I stay or remain the same
I guess some things never change
I guess some things never
Do it all again
When will it end
Make your amends
Tie up those loose ends
Tie up those loose ends
Do you feel better than you did before
Did anything change at all
Do you still need more
If I fall on a good day
Would I stay or remain the same
I guess some things never change
I guess some things never
If I fall on a good day
Would I stay or remain the same
I guess some things never change
I guess some things never
Do you feel better than you did before
Did anything change at all
Do you still need more
If I fall on a good day
Would I stay or remain the same
I guess some things never change
I guess some things never
If I fall on a good day
Would I stay or remain the same
I guess some things never change
I guess some things never
