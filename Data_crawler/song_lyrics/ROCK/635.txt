Song Name: Miles Away
Yeah some folks say it's lying
As they turn the other cheek
Well you can't expect greatness
When the leadership is cheap
You take what you're owed and give what you can spare
Just be honest with yourself and the rest might just be fair
We're miles away
We're miles away
We were broke before this sickness
And I don't think it will change
There's a fire in the thicket
And the kettle's burning hot
And all the wishful thinking
And the people are so thick
Naive for wishful thinking
Moving forward down that line
You take what you're owed and give what you can spare
Just be honest with yourself and the rest might just be fair
Don't say anything for awhile
Like you rowed 300 miles
We got to get back some time
When justice calls a calling
And I hope it's cold and true
Is there something is there nothing
Cause we wandered in this darkness
We're miles
We're miles away but we need it
We're miles
We're miles away but we need it
