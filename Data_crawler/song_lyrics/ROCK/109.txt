Song Name: Yen
You're the sin that I've been waitin' for
The hands around my throat
It's all I can think about
The smell of sweat and blood
I would feed you all my pleasures
Just to drown in all of yours
Have you heard of me?
Are you hurting me?
Let me savor what I'm waiting for
A chance to make me choke
You're all I can think about
The taste is red in rust
Can I hold you in my mouth
Until I fade into this form?
Can you cover me?
Will you breathe for me?
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death bеgins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
I don't know what has happened yеt
A surge of panicked zeal
Worry when it's not effect
This game is fine by me
All the words for retribution
Only add up to revenge
Overpower me (hahaha)
And devour me
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
Show me all the deaths are the same
Show me you'll remember my name
Show me all the deaths are the same
You will remember my name
I wish this pain could last forever, forever
I wish this kill could make me suffer for good
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I know that I am dying for you
I died for you
