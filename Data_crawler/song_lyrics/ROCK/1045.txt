Song Name: Rag Doll
Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin'
By the back door, ma'am
Hot times, get it while it's easy
I don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
I'm feelin' like a bad boy
Hmm, just like a bad boy
I'm rippin' up a rag doll
Like throwin' away an old toy
Some babe's talkin' real loud
Talkin' all about the new crowd
Try and tell me of an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grapevine
Keep shufflin' in a shoeshine
Old tin lizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin'
By the back door, ma'am
Hot times, get it while it's easy
I don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
Yes, I'm movin'
Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes, I'm movin'
Yes, I'm movin'
Old tin lizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin'
By the back door, ma'am
Hot times, get it while it's easy
I don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Baby, won't you do me
Baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
Yes, I'm movin'
Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine
Yes, I'm movin'
I'm really movin'
Sloe gin fizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin'
By the back door, ma'am
Hot times, get it while it's easy
I don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin'
By the back door, ma'am
Hot times, get it while it's easy
I don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
