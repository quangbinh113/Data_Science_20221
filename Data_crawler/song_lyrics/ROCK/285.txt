Song Name: Gatekeepers
Calling all psychos, do you wanna play?
Do you wanna make the bad people pay?
Are you beat down? Are you fed up?
'Cause we've had enough, we've had enough
Calling all psychos, wanna get down?
Do you wanna meet me on the outskirts of town?
Are you getting tired of fighting alone?
'Cause we've had enough, we've had enough, uh
We get a little reckless
We get a little live
We get a little desperate
We get a little bit la la la la la la
La la la la la
This one's going out to the gatekeepers
Trying to keep out all the daydreamers
So you wanna guard the doors?
You'll end up with a war
We came to get ours and you're gonna get yours
Gatekeepers
La la la la la la (Gatekeepers)
La la la la la
Calling all psychos, wanna fight back?
Wanna let them know you won't live like that?
Are you outside trying to break through?
We've had enough, we've had enough
Calling all psychos, wanna get down?
Do you wanna meet me on the outskirts of town?
Are you tired, fighting alone?
We've had enough, we've had enough (we've had enough)
We get a little reckless
We get a little live
We get a little desperate
We get a little bit la la la la la la
La la la la la
This one's going out to the gatekeepers
Trying to keep out all the daydreamers
So you wanna guard the doors?
You'll end up with a war
We came to get ours and you're gonna get yours
Put your hands up if you're breaking in
Running through the back door, taking it
Yeah, they can guard the doors
Don't matter anymore
We came to get ours and you're gonna get yours
Gatekeepers
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Gatekeepers
La la la la la la
La la la la la
You can lock the gates, but we'll get past
I should probably warn you, better watch your back
What you gonna do when we break the glass?
Now we're coming for you like psychopaths
You can lock the gates, but we'll get past
I should probably warn you, better watch your back
What you gonna do when we break the glass?
Now we're coming for you like psychopaths
Now we're coming for you like psychopaths
This one's going out to the gatekeepers
Trying to keep out all the daydreamers
So you wanna guard the doors?
You'll end up with a war
We came to get ours and you're gonna get yours
Put your hands up if you're breaking in
Running through the back door, taking it
Yeah, they can guard the doors
Don't matter anymore
We came to get ours and you're gonna get yours
