Song Name: Strangest Faces
I have seen the strangest faces
Yellow teeth and scary eyes
It turns out they've been there all my life, life, life, life
I have seen the strangest faces
Yellow teeth and scary eyes
It turns out they've been there all my life (life, life, life)
It's hard to find a friendly face when you've got nothing left to sell
Looks like heaven
Why's it hot as hell? (Hell, hell, hell)
A clean escape, is that what you're offering?
Well, I'll fuck it up 'cause that's what I do
May we part as lovers and die as friends
It's a million dollar view
To drown in the ocean with you
I have seen the strangest faces
Yellow teeth and scary eyes
It turns out they've been there all my life (life, life, life)
It's hard to find a friendly face when you've got nothing left to sell
Looks like heaven
Why's it hot as hell? (hell, hell, hell)
I'm starting to see the point they make
And if the good part ever starts, I'll hope I'm still awake
I have seen the strangest faces
Yellow teeth and scary eyes
It turns out they've been there all my life (life, life, life)
It's hard to find a friendly face when you've got nothing left to sell
Looks like heaven
Why's it hot as hell? (hell, hell, hell)
