Song Name: No More No More
Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I ain't' seen no daylight
Since we started this band
No More, No More
No More, No More
Store bought clothes
Falling apart at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams
[No More, No More
No More, No More
Holiday Inns, lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same
No More, No More
No More, No More
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Stalemate jailbait
Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews
No More, No More
No More, No More
Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees
No More, No More
No More, No More
Baby I'm a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I don't stop changing
I'll be writing out my will
It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
