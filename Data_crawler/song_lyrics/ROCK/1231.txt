Song Name: Killer Queen - Remastered 2011
She keeps the MoÃ«t et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake" she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime, an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (killer, killer)
Then again incidentally (she's a killer queen)
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Drop of a hat
She's as willing as playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive (drive you wild, wild)
She's out to get you
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try?
