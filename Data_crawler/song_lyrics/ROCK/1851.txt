Song Name: Trick Or Treat
Trick or treat, baby, on a night like this
Trick or treat, whoa, whoa, and that means a kiss
Trick or treat, baby, and don't let me miss
A sweet kiss from you on a night like this
Trick or treat, baby, by the light of the moon
Trick or treat, whoa, whoa, don't leave me so soon
Trick or treat, baby, I go in a swoon
From the sweet way you kiss me by the light of the moon
Trick or treat, baby, oh, what a night
Trick or treat, whoa, whoa, what a sweet delight
Trick or treat, baby, and hold me tight
And keep a-kissin' me sweetly, oh, what a night
Trick or treat, baby, in your own sweet way
Trick or treat, whoa, whoa, anything you say
Trick or treat, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I just love for you to kiss me in your own sweet way
Trick or treatin'
