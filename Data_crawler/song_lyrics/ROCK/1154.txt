Song Name: The Importance of Being Idle
I sold my soul for the second time
'Cause the man don't pay me
I begged my landlord for some more time
He said, "Son, the bill's waiting"
My best friend called me the other night
He said, "Man, are you crazy?"
My girlfriend told me to get a life
She said, "Boy, you lazy"
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute, a man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
Give me a minute, a man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
I lost my faith in the summertime
'Cause it don't stop raining
The sky all day is as black as night
But I know I can't blame me
I begged my Doctor for one more line
He said, "Son, words fail me"
There ain't no place to be killing time
I guess I'm just lazy
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute, a man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
