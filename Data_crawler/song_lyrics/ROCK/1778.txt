Song Name: Be My Wife - 2017 Remaster
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've lived every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
