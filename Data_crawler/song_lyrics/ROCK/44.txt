Song Name: All Comes Crashing
Starting over won't be easy, broken divided
Split tomorrow from today
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it breaks
Starting over when the story's got an astounding twist
You better turn that page
When push it comes to shove, we do not fall out of love
We double down, we do not fade
For all I know
This might be my last night
If that's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside when it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
Starting over won't be easy, damage be damned
Please, say you love me just as I am
Starting over won't be easy, misunderstand that pattern
Fear is forcing your hand
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it all breaks
When push it comes to shove, we do not fall out of love
We double down, we do not fade
For all I know
This might be my last night
If that's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
If all we knew
Came crashing down tonight
I'd be with you, and there's no one
I would rather be dying beside
When it all comes crashing, all comes crashing down
When it all comes crashing, all comes crashing down
We'll come crashing down together, don't expect to live forever
We'll come crashing down together
If it all comes crashing down tonight
We'll come crashing down together, don't expect to live forever
We'll come crashing down together
When it all comes crashing, crashing, crashing, crashing
For all I know
This might be my last night
If that's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
If all we knew
Came crashing down tonight
I'd be with you, and there's no one
I would rather be dying beside when it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
