Song Name: BWP
Up on my bed I'm looking to mend
I contend I've got a case, a fight in my head
I've got a ten I'm willing to spend
A day is long when not much is coming in
Cross off 60 more, this future was a bore
Up on the screen pearly white tiresome scene
Stuck-in-place-face, they call it acting
Ends with a nod, a wink eyes meet
Under the table things, you wanna come clean?
If you confess I'll look into the rest
Audit a congress diplomatic nonsense
Hang a jury like I'm hanging laundry
Tickles your throat, I'm onto something
Cross off 60 more, this future was a bore
Cross off 60 more, this future was a bore
