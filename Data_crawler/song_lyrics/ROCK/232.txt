Song Name: Crumbs
Big world
Says he wants to see the light for once,
Well maybe if you try
It's so sad
Babe don't look so sad
I've got it wrong today
And if she doesn't go your way
Look up to blue skies and say hey
It's ok it's ok
Big world
Says he wants to see the light for once,
Well maybe if you try
It's so sad
Babe don't look so sad
I've got it wrong today
Wrong today
And if she doesn't go your way
Look up to blue skies and say hey
It's ok it's ok
Big world
Says he wants to see the light for once,
Well maybe if you try
It's so sad
Babe don't look so sad
I've got it wrong today
Says he wants to see the light for once,
Well maybe if you try
It's so sad
Babe don't look so sad
I've got it wrong today
