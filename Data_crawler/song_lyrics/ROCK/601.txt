Song Name: Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress) - 1999 Remaster
Saturday night, I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the D.A. man
When I heard this woman singing a song
A pair of forty fives made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
'Bout a 5'9", beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Woo!
I saw her heading to the table
Well, a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said, "I hope that you're able, boy"
Well, I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Well, suddenly we hear the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping under doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shootin' a gun
Well, the D.A. was pumpin' my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her, don't get scared 'cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my livin'
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9", beautiful, tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, mmm
Had it all
Ah, she had it all
