Song Name: Since I've Been Loving You - Remaster
Working from seven to eleven every night
Really makes the life a drag
I don't think that's right

I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could
'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you, darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, ah yeah
Everybody tryna tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying
Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could
I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, that ain't right, no, no
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out!
Said I've been crying
Oh, my tears they fell like rain

Don't you hear them
Don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them
Don't you hear them falling?
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them new fangled, new-fangled back-door man
I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah, yeah, it makes me drag
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
And just one more, just one more
Oh, yeah
Since I've been loving you
I'm gonna lose my worried mind
