Song Name: Love Found A Way
I was down, I was through
My bitterness I blamed on you
In my heart I knew the truth
But in my shame I had no proof
It was hard to forgive
As I lost the will to live
Digging deep to find a way
It was there I thought to pray
Holy God do you see me
If you love can you love me
In truth I can not say
But in my heart love found a way
Now I'm back, from the dead
Loving life instead
With blood running through my veins
And a heart pumping for a change
It's better left unsaid
But I was given up for dead
In truth I can not say
But in my heart love found a way
I was down, I was through
My callousness I blamed on you
In my heart I knew the truth
But in my shame I had no proof
Holy God do you see me
If you love can you love me
In truth I cannot say
But in my heart love found a way
Now I'm back from the dead
Loving life instead
With blood running through my veins
And a heart pumping for a change
It's better left unsaid
But I was given up for dead
In truth I cannot say
But in my heart love found a way
Now I'm back from the dead
Loving life instead
With blood running through my veins
And a heart pumping for a change
Take me as I am
I'm a completely different man
And in truth I cannot say
But in my heart love found a way
Love found a way
Yes love found a way
Love found a way
Yes found a way
