Song Name: Gas In The Tank
Pour hammer riffs all over me
A little dirty, a little cheap
Move your fingers up and down the fret
The V is flyin' without a net
Black me in and black me out
The king of riffs is back in town
Who is up for a deadly sting?
Black me out and black me in
Let's play it louder, play it hard
Laid back and a little dark
Give me a dirty riff, my friend
There's gotta be more gas in the tank
Gas in the tank
Sign your name across my skin
We're born to lose, we live to win
There's lots of gas in my Trans Am
It's wham bam, thank you mam
Pour hammer riffs all over me
A little dirty, a little cheap
Only rock and no bling bling
Black me out and black me in
Let's play it louder, play it hard
Laid back and a little dark
Give me a dirty riff, my friend
There's gotta be more gas in the tank
Louder, play it hard
Best friends will never part
So give me a dirty hook, my friend
There's gotta be more gas in the tank
You want it louder? (Yeah, yeah)
Louder? (Yeah, yeah)
You want it louder? (Yeah, yeah)
So much louder (yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Let's play it louder, play it hard
Laid back and a little dark
Give me a dirty riff, my friend
There's gotta be more gas in the tank
Louder, play it hard (play it louder)
Best friends will never part (will never part)
So give me a dirty hook, my friend (a dirty hook, my friend)
There's gotta be more gas in the tank
Gas in the tank
G-G-Gas in the tank
Lots of gas in the tank
