Song Name: Pink
Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink, on the lips of your lover (oh)
'Cause pink is the love you discover
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink it's the new kinda lingo
Pink, like a deco umbrella
It's kink, but you don't ever tell her, yeah
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
I want to be your lover
I wanna wrap you in rubber
And it's pink as the sheets that we lay on
'Cause pink, it's my favorite crayon, yeah
Pink, it was love at first sight, yeah
Pink, when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink, it's like red but not quite
And I think, everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
