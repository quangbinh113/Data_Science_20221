Song Name: Waiting On The Sky To Change
There's something in the air
Burning ions in the oxygen are all aglow
A feeling everywhere
Premonitions of the storm that comes, but I won't go
I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is home
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change
(Waiting on the sky to change)
I've been frozen since that day
I saw my clear blue skies as they turned to gray in front of me
It's hard to find my way
Can I rise above when giving up is all I know?
I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is hope
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change
(And the water's rising)

(And the water's rising)
And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's rising
I won't drown in the flood you made
And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's rising
I won't drown in the flood you made
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
