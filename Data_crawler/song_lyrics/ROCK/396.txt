Song Name: Time Waits For No One
Time waits for no one
I've learnt before
Memories washed away like sand on the shore
My days are numbered
My past is spent
'Don't forget', who knows what it meant?
Don't know what I will do if I don't find
What was left behind
Maybe I look too deep at what I strived
For in my life
How could I forget
All those we have met
No one seems to care
How much I despair
I try so hard to remember those days
If you leave now then I know I'll fade
You slip away
Regrets fill up
Those happy memories, I'm running out of luck
To lose my mind
Seems quite unkind
All I want now is pure peace of mind
Don't know what I will do if I don't find
What was left behind
Maybe I look too deep at what I strived
For in my life
How could I forget
All those we have met
No one seems to care
How much I despair
I try so hard to remember those days
If you leave now then I know I'll fade
Don't know what I will do if I don't find
What was left behind
Maybe I look too deep at what I strived
For in my life
How could I forget
All those we have met
No one seems to care
How much I despair
I try so hard to remember those days
If you leave now then I know I'll fade
