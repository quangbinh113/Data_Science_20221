Song Name: Purple Haze
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately, things just don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no
Ooh... ahhh
Ooh... ahhh
Ooh... ahhh
Ooh... ahhh, yeah!
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?
Oh, help me
Ah, yeah, purple haze
Oh, no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me baby, tell me
I can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no, no
No, it's painful, baby
