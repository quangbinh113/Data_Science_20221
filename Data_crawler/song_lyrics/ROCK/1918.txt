Song Name: Anyone's Daughter - 1996 Remaster
The wind is blowing from a new direction
You're thinking 'bout going, I know
It's been a long season and hard on our affections
But that's no reason to let go
You change just like the weather
But the weather, you know, will always change
If you stay, it'll get better
Wherever you go, it's bound to rain
So put on your jacket and stand your ground
Love's gonna have its highs and lows
If we turn and face it, the wind will come around
Don't have to chase it when it blows
You change just like the weather
Well, I stood under your bedroom window
Throwing up a brick
No one came I threw one more
That really did the trick
Your daddy came and banged my head
He said, "What kind of man
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl"
And threw me in the can
You're a farmer's daughter
You're a farmer's daughter
Why do I always get
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get
I won't get no more eggs and water
Now I've laid the farmer's daughter
Imagine, I was a full-grown man
And I could talk just right
Could I come and see you here
And do this every night?
Wham, the door comes crashing down
Your daddy's face all pale
Says, "Come with me you hairy bum
I'll put you in my jail?"
You're a judge's daughter
You're a judge's daughter
Why do I always get
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get
Now I'm getting jail and torture
'Cause I made the judge's daughter, yes I did, it was nice
It seems they're screaming law and order
When I go with anyone's daughter
Woman, I should like some peace
And daddy hold your tongue
I think you're gonna die of fright
When I tell you what I've done
I can hear your tales and lies
You say I'm dumb and scraggy
But man this dumb and scraggy
Is your daughter's baby's daddy
She's a lucky daughter
Such a lucky daughter
Why did I always get
The kinda girl I didn't wanna get
Now I've got what I always fought for
'Cause I've married a rich man's daughter
Ha, what do ya think of that?
But the weather, you know, will always change
If you stay, it'll get better
Wherever you go, it's bound to rain
You change just like the weather
But the weather, you know, will always change
If you stay, it'll get better
Wherever you go, it's bound to rain
You change just like the weather
