Song Name: Seven Seas Of Rhye - Remastered 2011
Fear me you loathsome, lazy creatures
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
At the seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
At the seven seas of Rhye
Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do or else die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
(I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
Then I'll get you
Begone with you short and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
