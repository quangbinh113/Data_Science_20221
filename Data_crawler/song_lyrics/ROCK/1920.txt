Song Name: Lady Luck - 2010 Digital Remaster
She was a juke-box dancer, a blue eyed gypsy queen
She always had an answer for what she'd done and where she'd been
A feathercane Lady Midnight for all around to see
She spoke with words of wisdom, and this is what she said to me
Lady luck
Come on, give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend
I have always been a sinner but then the lady came along
She stole my heart and turned me 'round 'til I didn't know right from wrong
She whispered words of kindness I'd never ever heard before
Golden words and silver tongue 'til I really couldn't take no more
Lady luck
Come on, give me what I want
Pull me up, oh yeah
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend
Lady luck
Come on, give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend
Come on, shake me
Lady luck
Come on, give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend
