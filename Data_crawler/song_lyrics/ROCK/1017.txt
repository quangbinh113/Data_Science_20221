Song Name: Forever - Live
I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl I'm out of my head over you
I lived my life believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever
I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't wanna go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever
Yeah
I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Well, I lived my life believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever
Hey
Alright
