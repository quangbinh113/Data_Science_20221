Song Name: Dream On
Give it time
And look in the mirror
All these lies in my face kept me clearer
The past is gone
In when back like, dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got do's and life depends
I know nobody knows
Where I'd comes and where I goes
I know everybody saying you got the rules to know anyway
Half my life some those written pages
Living long from fools and from sages, you know it's true
All the things come back to you
Sing winner sing for year
Sing for the laugh, sing for the tear
Sing winner, just for today
Never tomorrow they could long take you away
Yeah, sing winner, sing for year
Sing for the laugh and sing for the tear
Sing winner, just for today
Never tomorrow they could long take you away
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, oh-o-o-oh
Sing winner, sing for the year
Sing for the laugh, sing for the tear
Sing winner, just for today
Never tomorrow they could long take you away
Sing winner, sing for the year
Sing for the laugh and sing for the tear
Sing winner, just for today
Never tomorrow they could long take you away
