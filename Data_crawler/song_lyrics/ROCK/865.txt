Who are you?
The new number two
Who is number one?
You are number six
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I'll kill to eat
I'm starving now, feeling dead on my feet
Going all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want, I do as I please
Run, fight
To breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, ha ha, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going, out
If you kill me, it's self defense
If I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight
To breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
Break the walls, I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
Not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
