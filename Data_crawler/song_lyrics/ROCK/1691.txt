Song Name: Sixteen
Sweet sixteen
In leather boots
Body and soul, I go crazy
Baby, baby I'm a hungry
Sweet sixteen
Funky bar, all full of faces
Pretty faces, beautiful faces
Body and soul, body and soul
I give it to you
I am an easy mark
With my broken heart
Sweet sixteen
Show you my explosion
Sweet sixteen
Go out to the funky bar
I get hurt, crying inside
'Cause everybody's so fine and
And they don't need me
Tell me what can I do
Sweet sixteen?
I give you my body and soul
Sweet sixteen
I must be hungry
'Cause I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby, I know
That's not normal
But I love you, I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen
Everywhere I go, I love it
