Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You don't have to go

You don't have to go
You don't have to go
I-I-I-I-I-I
All those tears I cry
All those tears I cry, oh-oh, I
Baby, please don't go
When I read the letter you wrote me
Made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the words that it told me
Made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so
I can't let you go
I love you
Ooh, baby, I love you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Every breath I take, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, every move I make

Oh baby, please don't go
I-I-I-I-I-I
You hurt me to my soul

You hurt me to my soul

Darling, please don't go
When I read the letter you sent me
Made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it brought me
Made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so
And I can't let you go
I love you
Ooh baby, I love you, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You don't have to go

You don't have to go
Oh, baby
Babe, please, please, please, please
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, baby
Oh-oh, I really love you, baby
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, darlin'
Oh, girl, oh
Oh baby, I still love you so
Oh baby, I still love you so, oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
(Fire) Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, oh
(Fire) Ah-ah ah-ah, ah
Ooh, yeah (fire)
Ah baby, baby
