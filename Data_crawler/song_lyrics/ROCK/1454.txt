Song Name: Wishful Sinful
Wishful
Crystal water covers everything in blue
Coolin' water
Wishful
Sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blue
Magic
Risin'
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea
But not enough for
You and me and sunshine
Love to hear the wind cry
Wishful
Sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blue
Love to hear the wind cry
Love to hear you
Cryin', yeah
