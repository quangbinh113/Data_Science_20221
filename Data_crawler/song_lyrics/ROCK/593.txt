Song Name: Voices Carry
In the dark, I'd like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away-a-ay
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say-a-ay
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Ah-ah

I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear-eh-eh
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Ah-ah
Oh!
He wants me, but only part of the time
He wants me, if he can keep me in line
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Oh, oh, oh, hush hush, shut up now, voices carry
Oh, oh, oh, hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Oh, oh, oh, hush hush, darling, she might overhear
Hush, hush, oh, oh, voices carry
Hush, hush, he said shut up
He said shut up
Oh God, can't you keep it down?
Voices carry
Hush, hush, oh, oh voices carry
I wish he would let me talk
