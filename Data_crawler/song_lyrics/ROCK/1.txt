Song Name: Love Abuser (Save Me)
I'm just a bright-eyed bitch
With my heart in a cage
If I scratched out your guts
Would it scare you away?
If my sea dug a hole in your soul and your brain
But I loved you to death, could you handle the pain?
I'm a user
A love-abuser
I'm addicted to you
Save me if you're willing to die
In the name of love
Yeah, I dare you to try
Save me 'til we're buried alive
'Cause we're both fucked up
But I need you tonight
Save, save, save me
Save, save, save me
We crawl into your skin
Like a roach on a plank
Give us stitches and pins
'Til we can't separate
You're the king of the world
I'm a moth to your flame
I would kill to be yours
Do you love me the same?
Save me if you're willing to die
In the name of love
Yeah, I dare you to try
Save me 'til we're buried alive
'Cause we're both fucked up
But I need you tonight
Save, save, save me
Save, save, save me
(Save, save, save me)
I'm a user, a love-abuser (save, save, save me)
I'm a user, a love abuser (save, save, save me)
Save me if you're willing to die
In the name of love
Yeah, I dare you to try
Save me 'til we're buried alive
'Cause we're both fucked up
But I need you tonight
Save, save, save me
Save, save, save me
