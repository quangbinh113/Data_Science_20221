Song Name: Kill The Noise
(I just feel like I'm channeling something)
(Kill the noise)
No love, no feelings
I choke on the air I'm breathin'
Undone, unhealin'
Ain't nobody stopping the bleeding
Deaf with demons on both sides
Can't take no angel left inside
Take to the static in my mind
And I can't hide
This rage, I just can't escape
Screamin' at my face
So loud, I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free falling to grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise!
(Kill the noise)
My scars keep screamin'
I lived through the pain for a reason
My gut, my anger
It drives me down like an anchor!
I'm deaf with demons on both sides
Can't take no angel left inside
Take to the static in my mind
And I can't hide
This rage, I just can't escape
Screamin' at my face
So loud, I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free falling to grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise!
Shut up!
Shut up!
This rage, I just can't escape
Screamin' at my face
So loud, I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free falling to grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise!
(Kill the noise)
Breaking through my mistakes
Free falling to grace, I'm not insane
