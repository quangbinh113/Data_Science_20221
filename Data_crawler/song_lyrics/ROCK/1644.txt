Song Name: Stay Free - Remastered
We met when we were in school
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools
The teacher says we're dumb
We're only having fun
You know, we piss on everyone
In the classroom
When we got thrown out, I left without much fuss
An' weekends we'd go dancing
Down streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh
Got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night
Smokin' menthol
I practised daily in my room
You were down the crown
Planning your next move
Go on a nicking spree
Hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three
Years in Brixton
I did my very best to write
How was butlins?
Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out
We're gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fuckin' down
To a cinder
'Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I wanna go
And I'll never forget the feeling I got
When I heard that you'd got home
An' I'll never forget the smile on my face
'Cause I knew where you would be
An' if you're in the crown tonight
Have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly
Stay free
