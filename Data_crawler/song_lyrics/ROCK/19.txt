Song Name: Fallin' With Me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You be my Alice
And I'll be your Mad Hatter
We can live in a palace
Nothing too amateur
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' for me?
Show me your talents
I'll throw them back at ya
No matter what happens
I'll keep up the temperature
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' for me? (Woo!)
Yes or no?
Let's go! (Yeah)
You're coming with me
Let's take a dive
Meet at the rainbow
9:45
Wear something trashy
That's what I like (yeah)
We're on the rooftop
Jumpin' off the sides (jumpin' off the sides)
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' (are you?), fallin' with me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
The evil is landing through the roof on your tablе top
Let's eat up some damagе (woo!)
There goes my trail of thought
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' with me? (Are you fallin' with me, babe?)
Yes or no?
Let's go! (Yeah)
You're coming with me
Let's take a dive (dive)
Meet at the rainbow
9:45 (five)
Wear something trashy (woo!)
That's what I like (yeah)
We're on the rooftop
Jumpin' off the sides (sides)
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' for me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Tell me, baby)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah, me through)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (anyways)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo!
Are you coming with me?
Let's take a dive (dive)
Meet at the rainbow
9:45 (not a second later)
Wear something trashy
That's what I like (that's what I like)
We're on the rooftop
Jumpin' off the sides (jumpin' off the sides)
Are you fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa fallin' (woo!), fallin for me?
(Tell me, baby)
Fallin' with me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
