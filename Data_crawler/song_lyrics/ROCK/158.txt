Song Name: Out
Lies and deception
Timed to perfection
Sighs of affection
Hide your intention
Rant about a fantasy
Gaslight everywhere
Handing out catastrophe
Acting like you care
But this time I'm knocking lights out
Through
I'm through
Through
Through with you
Spine bent direction
Silent infection
The sentimental act you do
Is dying on the vine
Better dead than black and blue
Broken by design
Yeah this time it's gloves off action
Through
I'm through
Through
Through with you
Through
I'm through
Through
Through with you
Out!
Out!
Out!
Through
I'm through
Through
Through with you
Through
I'm through
Through
Through with you
Out!
Out!
Out!
Out!
Out!
