Song Name: What I Like About You
Hey!
Uh-huh
Hey!
Uh-huh
What I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
Tryin' to come over tonight, yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true (that's what I like)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)
What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go, up, down, jump around
I think about true romance, yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)
Woah!
Hey!
What I like about you
You keep me warm at night
Never want to let you go, no
You make me feel alright, yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear
Now tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like about you)
Hey!
Uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey
Hey!
Uh-huh
Hey!
Uh-huh
Hey!
