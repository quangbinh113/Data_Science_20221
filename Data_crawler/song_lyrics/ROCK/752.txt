Song Name: Brown Eyed Girl
Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl
You my, brown eyed girl

And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio
Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a-slidin'
All along the waterfall with you
My brown eyed girl
You my, brown eyed girl
Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
Just like that
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
La te da
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, you have grown!
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You my, brown eyed girl
Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da (Lyin' in the green grass)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da (Bit by, bit by, bit by, bit by, bit by, bit)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
La, te da la, te da la, te da la, la la, la la
Sha la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
