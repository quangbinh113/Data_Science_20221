Song Name: Love In An Elevator - Single Version
Workin' like a dog for the boss man (Whoa)
Workin' for the company (Whoa, yeah)
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin' (Whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (Whoa, yeah)
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Jackey's in the elevator (Whoa)
Lingerie second floor (Whoa, yeah)
She said, can I see you later? (Whoa)
And love you just a little more (Whoa, yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said I'll show you how to fax in the mail room
Honey and have you home by five
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Elevator in the air
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an
Elevator
Goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I hit the ground
Gonna be a penthouse pauper (Whoa)
Gonna be a millionaire (Whoa, yeah)
I'm gonna be a real fast talker (Whoa)
And have me a love affair (Whoa, yeah)
Gotta get my timin' right (Whoa)
It's a test that I gotta pass (Whoa, yeah)
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey (Whoa)
Kiss your sassafras (Whoa, yeah)
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Will you care? Will you care?
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Will you care? Will you care?
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one, one, one, more
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one, one, one, more
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one, one, one, more
Love in an elevator
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
In the air, in the air
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
