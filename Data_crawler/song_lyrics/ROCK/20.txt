Song Name: Eddie
I sail in the sunset's trail
I'm a bit of a king
Granny would take a trip
I've been bending the strings
Got hammers in both my hands
Such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam
Does that make me Dutch
Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Love them children
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983
Smoking the reefer
Feeling my own light
My brother's a keeper
I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro
Parked in the high school lot
A little sombrero
'Cause teacher was way too hot
Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Listen to Lord now
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983
Tell my love but leave me never
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at the whiskey
GTOs tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all
Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
What'd I say, oh
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983
Please don't remember me
For what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee
Am I ready
Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
I guess I played a Flying V
