Song Name: City of the Dead (Live) [Remastered]
This is the City of the Dead
As we lie side by side in bed
I'd do something else instead
It is the City of the Dead
When we went out kickin' around
But you got drunk an' fallen down
An' I wished I could be like you
With the Soho River drinking me down
In the City of the Dead
Fall in love an' fall in bed
It wasn't anything you said
Except I know we both lie dead
"Don't you know where to cop?"
That's what New York Johnny said
"You should get to know your town
Just like I know mine"
While all the windows stare ahead
An' the streets are filled with dread
Every nation in the world
Slinks through the alley after girls
What we wear is dangerous gear
It'll get you picked on anywhere
Though we get beat up we don't care
At least it livens up the air
But some days we hide inside
All courage gone and paralyzed
Sniff that wind of ugly tension
Today the jerks have got aggression
Yeah, today the jerks have got aggression
This is the City of the Dead
It is the City of the Dead
It is the City of the Dead
It is the City of the Dead
