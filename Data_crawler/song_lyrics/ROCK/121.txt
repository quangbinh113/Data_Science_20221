Song Name: One More Day
I always thought that we'd have more time
But it passed us by
While we were dreaming
I swear I asked you a thousand times
Always said you're fine
But you were sinking
Deeper and deeper, you faded again
And time after time I would reach for your hand
Would this be different if you could've let me in?
Let me in
So I can say what I need to say
Yeah, we'll find away, we'll find a way
To break down the walls you made
Yeah, we'll find a way
For one more, one more day
I always thought that we'd have more time
In the blink of an eye, our world was taken
I would've walked through your hell with you
If you asked me to
To fight your demons
But deeper and deeper, you faded again
And time after time I would reach for your hand
Would this be different if you could've let me in?
Let me in
So I can say what I need to say
Yeah, we'll find away, we'll find a way
To break down the walls you made
Yeah, we'll find a way
For one more, one more day
'Cause I'm trapped in the weight of the pain you left
I'm calling your name but you won't come back
I'd give anything just for one more day
I'd give anything for one more day with you
If I can say what I need to say
Then we'll find away, we'll find a way
To break down the walls you made
Yeah, we'll find a way, find a way
For you, for you
So I can say what I need to say
Yeah, we'll find away, we'll find a way
To break down the walls you made
Yeah, we'll find a way
For one more, one more day
One more day
