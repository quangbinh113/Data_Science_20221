Song Name: Bad Man
Bad man, such a sad man
Is it ever enough
Will you ever find a new obsession
What a bad man, like a blind man
So lost in the dark
Still searching for his own salvation
Bad man, you've been had man
You can never return
And you're never going to find redemption now
Bad man... a bad man
Another madman
Oh bad man, what's the reason why
Innocents always have to die by your hand.
No, I will never understand
Why these cowards bow your demands
We're all victims of at the mercy of... another bad man
Bad man, no, you didn't think that we were ready for war, and you questioned our determination
Take it back man, 'cause we're not dealing with your shit anymore, you're about to have an education
Damn man, got a plan man, need to settle the score, there's no way that you can be forgiven now
Bad man... a bad man
A fucking madman
Oh bad man, what's the reason why
Innocents always have to die by your hand
No, I will never understand
Why these cowards bow your demands
We're all victims of at the mercy of... another bad man
Oh bad man, what's the reason why
Innocents always have to die by your hand
No, I will never understand
Why these cowards bow your demands
We're all victims of at the mercy of... another bad man
Oh bad man, what's the reason why
Innocents always have to die by your hand
No, I will never understand
Why these cowards bow your demands
We're all victims of at the mercy of... another bad man
We're all victims of at the mercy of... another bad man
