Song Name: Iâ€™m a Mess (with YUNGBLUD)
Starin' at the pavement alone
Wishin' I was on my way home to you
All the shops in London are closed
And I don't know where to go from here
No, I don't know where to go from here
But I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess when we're not together
Such a wreck, such a wreck, I hope it's not forever
Will I see you again?
I wish it was me and you 'til the end
But I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
It hasn't been the same since that night (oh)
I wish I said "I love you" just one more time (one more time)
I tried to figure out how to make it right
But I don't know where to go from here
No, I don't know where to go from here
But I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess when we're not together
Such a wreck, such a wreck, I hope it's not forever
Will I see you again? (See you again)
I wish it was me and you 'til the end
But I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Oh, 'cause I know that I have my issues
The less we talk, the more I miss you
I die just a little, die just a little
I'm slippin' closer to the edge
I hear your voice, it's in my head
But you're gone again, gone again
I'm a mess, I'm a mess when we're not together
Such a wreck, such a wreck, I hope it's not forever
Will I see you again? (See you again)
I wish it was me and you 'til the end
'Cause I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I know I'm a mess, I'm a mess
