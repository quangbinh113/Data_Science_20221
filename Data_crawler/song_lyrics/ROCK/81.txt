Song Name: Pass The Nirvana
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why are you always saying, "Let the good times roll?"
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut bleeding through the soffit nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension right now
This is only a distraction
Swing, batter up, let's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat?
Why are you always saying, "Let that shit go?"
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of bloodsoaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now we're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension right now
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension right now
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
