Song Name: Dreams - Take 2
Two
Now there you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
Of what you had
And what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Remember what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Ooh-ooh, players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
Ooh, when the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know
You'll know
You'll know
