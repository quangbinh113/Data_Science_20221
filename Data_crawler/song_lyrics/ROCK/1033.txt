Song Name: Thrills In The Night
Early morning, as she wakes from her sleep 9 to 5
Is the day that she'll keep
Ties her hair up and her blouse buttoned tight
Gets her work done as she waits for the night
All the people, tell me what would they say
If they knew her, how she hides it away
Locked inside, there's the start of a flame
And the feelings that she never will tame
Ooh, as she's walking around like a mystery
Ooh, there's a woman that nobody sees livin' inside
Thrills in the night, far from the light
Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
In the evening when she takes to the street
She goes hunting with a body in heat
And desires she's kept hidden inside
Make her tingle and she knows why she lies
Ooh, as she's walking around like a mystery
Ooh, there's a woman that nobody sees living inside
Thrills in the night, far from the light
Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
Thrills in the night, far from the light
Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
Ooh, yeah
See the stranger that she's pushing away
As she dresses for the start of a day
And desires she's kept hidden inside
Make her tingle, yeah she knows why she lies
Thrills in the night, far from the light
Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
[(Yeah)] Thrills in the night, [(yeah)] far from the light
[(Oh)] Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
Thrills in the night, far from the light
Passion taking over
Prices she pays, all through the days
No one really knows her
Thrills in the night
