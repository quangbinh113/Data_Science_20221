Song Name: Space Truckin' - Remastered 2012
Well, we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We're meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space truckin' round the the stars
Come on,come on,come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on,come on,come on
Space trucking
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on,come on,come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on,come on,come on
Space trucking
The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealice
They're Space Truckin' everyday
Come on,come on,come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on,come on,come on
Space trucking
Come on,come on,come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on,come on,come on
Space trucking
Yeah,yeah,yeah,Space trucking
Yeah,yeah,yeah,Space trucking
Yeah,yeah,yeah,Space trucking
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah, yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah,Space trucking
Yeah, yeah, yeah
