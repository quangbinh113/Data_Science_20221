Song Name: Dinosaur
Dinosaur
Whatever happened to humanity?
Ya we've driven ourselves to insanity
We are human waste in a race to the finish
Now we know that we're all gonna get it
Do something stupid like some dumbass kids
Hiding in the dark, hunting down our friends
We are Lord of the flies till the very end
Now we know that we're all gonna get it
Whoa twenty-twenty four hours to go
Hey kids, boys and girls
Now we've really done it, it's the end of the world
'Cause, hey kids, we were warned
Tonight we're going out, going out like the dinosaur
Hoping heaven's gonna let you in
But your God is wondering where you been
When idiocracy is all there is
Now we know that we're all gonna get it
Carl Sagan rollin in his grave
We all lie to ourselves saying it's just a phase
Yeah, we're all fucked, yeah we can't be saved
Now we know that we're all gonna get it
Whoa ten-nine hours to go
Hey kids boys and girls
Now we've really done it, it's the end of the world
So pray big, oh my lord
Now we better run, better run
Come with me, now we're free
Let's all just purge the ending
Hey kids, we were warned
Tonight we're going out, going out like the dinosaur
Whoa only one minute to go
Hey kids boys and girls
Now we've really done it, its the end of the world
So pray big, oh my lord
Now we better run, better run
Come with me, now were free
Lets all just purge the ending
Hey kids, we were warned
Tonight we're going out, going out like the dinosaur
Like the dinosaur
