Song Name: See You Later, Alligator
Well I saw my baby walking
With another man today
Well I saw my baby walking
With another man today
When I asked her what's the matter
This is what I heard her say
See you later alligator
After a while crocodile
See you later alligator
After a while crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now
Don't you know you cramp my style
When I thought of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
When I thought of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
But the next time that I saw her
Reminded her of what she said
See you later alligator
After a while crocodile
See you later alligator
After a while crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now
Don't you know you cramp my style
She said I'm sorry pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you
She said I'm sorry pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you
Won't you say that you'll forgive me
And say your love for me is true
I said wait a minute 'gator
I know you mean it just for play
I said wait a minute 'gator
I know you mean it just for play
Don't you know you really hurt me
And this is what I have to say
See you later Alligator
After a while crocodile
See you later Alligator
After a while crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now
Don't you know you cramp my style
See you later alligator
After a while crocodile
See you later alligator
So long that's all goodbye
