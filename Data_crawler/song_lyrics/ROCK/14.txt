Song Name: Beguiled
So swallow hard the serpent
Of many tags and faces hid in masks
Coiled 'round this lung until the last
He'll crack your boots, young pagans
'Cause like you, I was hatched to traipse on cold
And 17's a long-drawn way from hope
And I've learned these lessons I was taught
Taut, so taught
And now I'm telling you
Return the faith
Return the faith
They're smashing out the veils
Return the faith
And there's no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades
Return the faith
You've gotta move
So as betrayed by rainbows
Here I convey I've sold out your dear 'cause
And the king has placed us in his jaws
It's sure, no place can hold us
But in this scene I'm December
And your June's wretch
And my idyls lay gasping as if death
And I've learned these lessons I was taught
Taut, so taught
And now I'm telling you
Return the faith
Return the faith
They're smashing out the veils
Return the faith
And there's no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades
Return the faith
You've gotta move
Return the faith
(Return the faith)
Return the faith
(Return the faith)
Return the faith
