Song Name: Sister
Around the corner,
That's where I'll be,
Trying to find,
What I don't.
The girls were strutting,
On down the street,
Heaven was calling,
But they found me.
She'll be your sister,
But not for free.
You'll never miss her,
Yeah if you want it,
Yeah if you want it to be.
Down by the alley,
Where the rats meet,
Too sick and blind,
Just drugs to eat.
The situation was high,
So everybody got low.
(She'll be your...)
Yeah if you want it to be,
Yeah if you wanted me.
Lost on the street,
That's where I'll be,
Trying to find,
What I don't need.
She was calling my name,
As I was saying goodbye,
Guilt stared me down,
But I've got nothing to hide.
(She'll be your sister...)
