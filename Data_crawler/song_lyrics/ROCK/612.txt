Song Name: All Shook Up
Well, a-bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, my hands are shaky, and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, please, don't ask me what's upon my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so, it scares me to death
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, please, don't ask me what's upon my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so, it scares me to death
When she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, uh
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, yeah
