Song Name: A Hard Day's Night - Remastered 2009
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money, to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, owww!
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
Mmm, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
