Song Name: Kick You When You're Down
As you're slipping down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
As you're slipping down the wall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Hey, mama
Why are you beating on my head?

Hey, hey, woman
Why do you kick me outta bed?
I said
Is it something, is it something that I said?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?

Shady lady
You think that money grows on trees
Rotten apples by the barrel ain't a delicacy
And you see
Is this is the way, the way it's meant to be?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no) so down
And I don't need to say
To say it ain't a sacrifice
(Oh no)
(Oh no)
Is this is the way, the way it's meant to be?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
That you're slippin' down a wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you?
Man, they're trying to trick you when you're down
