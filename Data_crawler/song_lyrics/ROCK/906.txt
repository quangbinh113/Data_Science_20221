Song Name: Guns for Hire
The word is out
That I'm about
And I've come gunning for you
I'm a real entertainer
A mischief maker
A lover of no fixed abode
Ooh, a quick draw on the floor
No law give you more
Sweet talker, lover of sin
You are what you got
You get what you want
Look out woman
I got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire
The gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire, yeah
I'm a wanted poster
A needed man
Running right across the land
I'm a smooth operator
A big dictator
Gonna mark you with my brand
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Quick draw, on the floor, big shot
Woah, hot to trot, big shot
Take a lot
Never get the drop on me
I'm a real entertainer
Mischief maker
Love in seven languages
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
This gun's for hire
I'll shoot you with desire
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
My gun's for hire
I'll shoot you with desire
What you get, big shot
You can't get, you can't get the drop on me, girl
