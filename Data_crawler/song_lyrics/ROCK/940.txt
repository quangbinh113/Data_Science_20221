Song Name: Gods Of War
Feelin' like it's all over
Feelin' like there's no love
Feelin' like it's not easy
Breathin' life in the dust
On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't gonna be heroes
There ain't gonna be anything
Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night
When we all fall down
When we walk into silence
When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence
Then the damage is done
Put away that gun
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be anywhere
Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night
That's right
We're fightin' for the gods of war
But what the hell we fightin' for?
We're fightin' with the gods of war
But I'm a rebel
And I ain't gonna fight no more, no way
On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't gonna be heroes, whoa
There ain't gonna be anything, no
Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night
Don't ya know that's right
We're fightin' for the gods of war
But what the hell we fightin' for?
We're fightin' with the gods of war
And I ain't gonna fight no more
Stop (stop fightin' for the gods of war) stop fightin' for the gods of war
(Yeah, what the hell we fightin' for?) What the hell we fightin' for?
(We're fightin' with the gods of war)
Heavy!
"Message to terrorists everywhere: You can run, but you can't hide"
"We're determined to stand together and we're determined to take action"
"We're not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states"
"We will not cave in"
"Today, we have done what we had to do"
"He counted on America to be passive. He counted wrong"
