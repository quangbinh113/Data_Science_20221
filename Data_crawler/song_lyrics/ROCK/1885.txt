Song Name: And I Love You So
And I love you so
People ask me how
How I've lived 'til now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes, I know how lonely life can be
When Shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my belief
Oh, and yes, I know how lonely life can be
When shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me, now you know
Thank you
Thank you very much
