Song Name: Tommy Gun - Remastered
Tommy gun
You ain't happy unless you got one
Tommy gun
Ain't gonna shoot the place up just for fun
Maybe he wants to die for the money
Maybe he wants to kill for his country
Whatever he wants, he's gonna get it
Tommy gun
You better strip it down for a customs run
Tommy gun
Waiting in the airport 'til kingdom come
An' we can watch you make it
On the nine o'clock news
Standing there in Palestine, lighting the fuse
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Tommy gun
Tommy gun
Tommy gun
You'll be dead, war is won
Tommy gun
But did you have to gun down everyone?
I can see it's kill or be killed
A nation of destiny has got to be fulfilled
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Tommy gun
You can be a hero in an age of none
Tommy gun
I'm cutting out your picture from page one
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours
An' give my false support to your cause
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Okay, so let's agree about the prize
And make it one jet airliner for ten prisoners
Boats and tanks and planes, it's your game
Kings and queens and generals learn your name
I see all the innocents, the human sacrifice
And if death comes so cheap, then the same goes for life
