Song Name: Cut Here
So we meet again! And I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand
Yeah it's a look I used to know
Three long years and your favorite man
Is that any way to say hello?
And you hold me like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me
Oh, c'mon and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while
Oh, I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eye
So dizzy Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you, to hold you
But chilly Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time
Won't be long until later
I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over over and you're gone
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much
But how many times can I walk away and wish, if only
How many times can I talk this way and wish, if only
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish if only but if only is a wish too late
