Song Name: Ain't That A Bitch
Up in smoke you've lost another love

As you take a hit off your last cigarette
Strung out, burnt out
Yeah you're down on your luck and you don't give a
'Til the best part of you starts to twitch
Ain't that a bitch
Freak out
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losing my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
'Cause love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night
Yeah
Ain't that a bitch
Ain't that a bitch
In a daze
In the throes of emotion
You see God in the Devil's eyes
Then you fall so far from grace
You wouldn't know a kiss if it was on your face
You can tell it to the jury but you ain't got no case
Freak out
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losing my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
The gal was fine as calamine
But not enough to scratch a seven year itch
'Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix
Yeah
Ain't that a bitch
Ain't that a bitch
Then you feel so out of place
Licking up the arsenic from the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison but you gotta have a taste
You gotta freak out
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losing my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in the ditch
'Cause love is like a warm gun
On a cold night
Yeah
Ain't that a bitch
Ain't that a bitch
