Song Name: Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)
So now you've caught on
Hey baby, where do you, comin' from
Boy she looked at me and smiled,
And looked into space
And she said, 'I'm comin' from the land of new rising sun'
And I said, 'hey, baby where you tryin' to go to'
Then she says, 'I'm gonna spread around peace of mind
And a whole lotta love to you and you'
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along
Would you like to come along?'
She asked me
'Yes take me along right now.'
Hey baby, can I step into your world a while?
'Yes you can' she said
'Come on back with me for a while
We're gonna go across the Jupiter sun
And see all your people on by one
You gotta help your people out right now
That's what I'm doin' it all about'
'Yeah yeah, may I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along?
Yeah yeah
Please take me'
