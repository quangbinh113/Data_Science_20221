Song Name: More Than Machines
Don't step on my toes
Let the weather go
It's been a long wait in bed
Say what?
We blow, let's go
This is the time to shine
Everything wrong should be right
Girls, you're in control
Not the government
Not the government
Nothing changes
Never stops
(Say what?)
Breathe
We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines
Don't forget the code
Let the wind blow
You can't be assured of a window
Shame bro, we know you foe
Here is the news in blood
Everything wrong should be right
The Earth dies
It's a money thing
It's a money thing
Nothing changes
Never stops
(Say what?)
Breathe
We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines
We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines
