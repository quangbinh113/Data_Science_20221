Song Name: Blow (feat. Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills)
I'm in love with the mess we're in
The game we're playing is a game I'll win
I'm a lovesick addict, can't get enough
Got a real bad habit of messing it up
Five, four, three, two, one
Baby, I'm about to blow
Ticking like a time bomb
Ready to explode
Hit you with my best shot
Got you in my sights
Running for your life
Love is a liar
R-R-Ready, aim, fire
Baby, I'm about to blow
I'm about to blow
I'm about to
I'm a sinner, sold my soul to play
Russian roulette is my favorite game
I'm a chaos addict, can't get enough
Got a real dark secret, I'll never give up
Five, four, three, two, one
Baby, I'm about to blow
Ticking likе a time bomb
Ready to explodе
Hit you with my best shot
Got you in my sights
Running for your life
Love is a liar
R-R-Ready, aim, fire
Baby, I'm about to blow
I'm about to blow (baby, I'm about to blow)
I'm about to
Baby, I'm about to blow
Ticking like a time bomb
Ready to explode
Hit you with my best shot
I'm about to blow
Ticking like a time bomb
Ready to explode
Hit you with my best shot
Got you in my sights
Running for your life
Love is a liar
R-R-Ready, aim, fire
Baby, I'm about to blow (I'm about to blow, to blow)
I'm about to blow (I'm about to blow, to blow)
I'm about to blow
Ticking like a time bomb
Ready to explode
Hit you with my best shot
I'm about to
Baby, I'm about to blow
