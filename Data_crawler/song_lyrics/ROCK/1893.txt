Song Name: Hey Jude
Hey, Jude, don't be a fool
Take a sad song, and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey, Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song, and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Let it out, and let it in
Hey, Jude
Begin to makin' the world a little better
Don't you know that
It's a fool who plays it cool
In makin' the world a little better
Hey, Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song, and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Let it out, and let it in
Hey, Jude
Begin to making the world a little better
Don't you know that
It's a fool who plays it cool
In takin' the world upon your shoulder
Hey, Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song, and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better (better, better, better)
