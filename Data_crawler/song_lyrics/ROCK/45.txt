Song Name: Place Your Debts
Gentlemen place your debts
Payment in full by future you
I think we can all agree
The ending is off to a great start
The present is soon replaced
In small increments
Attention fades
One or another way
The house will collect its mark
How do we keep making
All the same mistakes?
We'd rather have the misery
Than growing pains
I chose a mystery
Went there alone intentionally
I had to forgive mysеlf
For grieving imaginary loss
You'll pay with a live not lived
You'll pay with еach thought
What could've been
Though nothing adds to the cost
Like missing the ride you're on
How do we keep making
All the same mistakes?
We'd rather have the misery
Than growing pains
Growing pains
Gentlemen place your debts
I'd wish you good luck
But luck isn't in
The driver and passenger
Don't go the same place
How do we keep making
All the same mistakes?
We'd rather have the misery
Than growing pains
