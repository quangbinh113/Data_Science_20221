Song Name: Somebody To Love - Remastered 2011
Can
Anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah

I work hard (he works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (please)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
(He works hard) every day (every day)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody want to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody to believe
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord)
Ooh, somebody
Ooh (somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me someone to love?)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love-ove-ove (ooh, find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (find me)
(Somebody find me somebody to love)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to
Love?
Find me somebody to love (ooh)
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody)
Find me somebody to love (somebody, somebody to love)
(Find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love (find me, find me)
(Ooh, somebody to love)
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (find me, find me, find me)
(Somebody to love)
Find me somebody to love (anybody, anywhere, anybody)
Find me, find me, find me
