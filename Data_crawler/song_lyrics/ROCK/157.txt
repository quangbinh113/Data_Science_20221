Song Name: DEEP CUTS
Yeah, it's true, I don't know how it feels
But tell me, did you take the red or blue pill?
A finger on the trigger as a crutch
Time to press eject, it's a feeling in your gut
It's a heartache in the making
It's half post lonely
Deadbeat promises
For your eyes only
Eyes wide shut, you're all grown up
And oh, death by a thousand cuts
A lover's touch hurts twice as much
A flesh wound got you all torn up
And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone
It's a heartache in the making
It's half post lonely
Deadbeat promises
For your eyes only
He's got the legion, it's speaking, a language I ain't feeling
Caesar, the palace, OD'd on wreaking havoc
Stroke of genius, it's seamless, the man's an extremist
Eyes wide shut, you're all grown up
And oh, death by a thousand cuts
A lover's touch hurts twice as much
A flesh wound got you all torn up
And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone
I, I know
You've got
Deep cuts
People tell you to move on (I, I know)
Still holding on to what you know is gone (you've got)
An alibi, another chance to lie (deep cuts)
Caught with tears in your eyes
No more time for sad songs (I, I know)
In all black, no funerals (you've got)
Plastic flowers for vacant souls (deep cuts)
Jealously is a fatal dose
And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone
