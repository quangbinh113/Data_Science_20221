Song Name: Temple Of Ekur
The Temple of Ekur unites Heaven and Earth
Durangi Mountain House, the garden of the Gods
Sumerian God of air or known as Enlil Powerful
Is the son of Father Enkur, so divine
Fear, lead me to the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah, Egyptious
Ah, Egyptious
Terrifying words in the dungeon of Nungal
Queen of the abyss calls the sinner's end
Goddess of Ekur and the underworld
Worshiped by the sons and Babylonians, so divine
Fear, lead me to the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah, Egyptious
Ah, Egyptious
Celebrating all the offerings in gold
And pray for all of fallen
A priest in highest form
Speaks with devil tongues
Concealed from sunrise to sunset
Fear, lead me to the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah, Egyptious
Ah, Egyptious
Ah, Egyptious
Ah-ah-ah
