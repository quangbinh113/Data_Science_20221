Song Name: Soft Slam
So let me get this straight
You said I'm a failure
Just a little today
Push it down like drunken
When all this gets away will be the hope that finds yourself to be
To try my best if possible to fall
(Possible apart)
Word from worst to second phase
At least its progress
Couldn't learn to catch your face cause I missed you still
And all it gets away from me and hope to find your sympathy
To try to pass enough to fall apart
Soft slam
I fall dead
Soft slam
I fall dead
Soft slam
(When all this gets away will be the hope that finds yourself to be
To try my best if possible to fall)
Soft slam
(When all this gets away will be the hope that finds yourself to be
To try my best if possible to fall)
