Song Name: Strength to Endure
Walking through the cross fire heart
Feeling heavy and hopeless
And wonderin' how I ever will
See through this darkness
Every drop of blood can
Be so beautiful
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by the bucketful
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you and
Neon lights always gow hot
Baby we can see this through
Just give me all the strength you've got"
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I have the strenght to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strenght to endure
Because... because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you and
Neon lights always glow hot
Baby we can see this through
Just give me all the strength you've got"
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I have the strenght to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strenght to endure
