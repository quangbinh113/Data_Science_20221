Song Name: Police & Thieves - Remastered
Police and thieves in the street (Oh Yeah)
Scaring the nation with their guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the street (Oh Yeah)
Fighting the nation with their guns and ammunition
From Genesis to Revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
From Genesis to Revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
And all the crimes come in, day by day
And no one stops it in any way
All the peace maker turn war officers
Hear what I say
Police and thieves in the street (Oh Yeah)
Scaring the nation with their guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the street (Oh Yeah)
Fighting the nation with their guns and ammunition
From Genesis to Revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Oh yeah
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Oh yeah
And all the crime come in, day by day
No one stop it in any way
All the peace maker turn war officer
Hear what I say
Police, police, police and thieve (Oh Yeah)
Police, police, police and thieve (Oh Yeah)
From Genesis (Oh Yeah)
Police, police, police, police and thieves (Oh Yeah)
And I'm scaring, I'm fighting the nation (Oh Yeah)
Shooting, shooting their guns and, guns and ammunition (Oh Yeah)
Here come, here come, here come
The station is bombed (Oh Yeah)
Get out, get out, get out you people
If you don't want to get blown up (Oh Yeah)
The police, the police and the thieves (Oh Yeah)
You got an extra grand
But you got trapped in the middle of police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
