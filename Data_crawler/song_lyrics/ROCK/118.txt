Song Name: No Apologies
I hope you know
You don't have to say you're sorry
You don't have to live with the heartache you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
No apologies
I tried to write you out to get some closure
The more the years went by, we got cold shoulders
The more I realized as I got older
We can turn it all around
So don't you beat yourself into the ground
I hope you know
You don't have to say you're sorry
You don't have to live with the heartache you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
I know you tried your best, I know you struggled
The cards that you got dealt, they gave you trouble
Now I see the you in me, and I see double
We can turn it all around
I hope you know
You don't have to say you're sorry
You don't have to live with the heartache you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
We don't have to change the story
You don't have to carry the weight that you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
We can turn it all around
If you don't turn your back on me
We can turn it all around
If you don't turn your back on me
We can turn it all around
If you don't turn your back on me
We can turn it all around
I hope you know
You don't have to say you're sorry
You don't have to live with the heartache you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
We don't have to change the story
You don't have to carry the weight that you keep
'Cause I don't need no apologies
