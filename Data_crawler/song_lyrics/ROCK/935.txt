Song Name: Rock Rock (Till You Drop)
Hold on to your hat, hold on to your heart
Ready, get set to tear this place apart
Don't need a ticket, only place in town
That'll take you up the heaven and never bring you down
(Anything goes)
(Anything goes)
Women to the left, women to the right
There to entertain and take you through the night
So grab a little heat and come along with me
'Cause you mama don't mind, what you mama don't see
(Anything goes) That's right, come on
(Anything goes)
I said
Rock! Rock! Till you drop
Rock! Rock! Never stop
Rock! Rock! Till you drop
I say Rock! Rock! Till you drop
Rindin into danger' laughin' all the way
Free, fast and easy, livin' for today
Gotta lip service, get it while you can
Hot, sweet and nervous, love on demand
(Anything goes)
(Anything goes) All night long
I said
Rock! Rock! Till you drop
C'mon, rock! Rock! Never stop
You gotta rock! Rock! Till you drop
Ohh, rock! Rock! Till you drop
Oh yeah
Rock! Rock! Give it to me
It's what I got going through me
Don't ever stop, whoa, do it to me
Yeah, rock! Rock! You really move me
Here we go!
Rock! Rock! Till you drop
C'mon, rock! Rock! Never stop
Come on and rock! Rock! Till you drop
We gotta rock it till you drop, gonna take it to the top
Rock! Rock! Till you drop
Rock! Rock! Never stop
Come on, come on, come on!
Hold on, hold on, hold tight
We're gonna rock tonight
Too loud man, too loud
