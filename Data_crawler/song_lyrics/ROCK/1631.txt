Song Name: Safe European Home - Remastered
Well, I just got back an? I wish I never leave now
(Where? d you go?)
Who that Martian arrival at the airport, yeah?
(Where? d you go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where? d you go?)
The Johnny on the corner was very sympathetic
(Where? d you go?)
I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An? sitting here in my safe European home
Don? t wanna go back there again
Wasn? t I lucky, wouldn? t it be lovely?
(Where? d you go?)
Send us all cards and have a lay in on Sunday
(Where? d you go?)
I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell now
(Where? d you go?)
That natty dread drinks at the Sheraton Hotel, yeah?
(Where? d you go?)
I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An? sitting here in my safe European home
Don? t wanna go back there again
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
They got the sun and they got the palm tress
(Where? d you go?)
They got the weed and they got the taxies
(Where? d you go?)
Whoa, the harder they come and the home of ol? Bluebeat
(Where? d you go?)
I? d stay and be a tourist but can? t take the gun play
(Where? d you?)
I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An? sitting here in my safe European home
Don? t wanna go back there again
