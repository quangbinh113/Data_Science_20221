Song Name: Chemical Emotion
Come in here my love
There's a star up above
And it's always reminding me how
How I'm no wiser
So I'll stay here for you
With a little paranoia
It's only love if you fall
If it's hitting harder
And then one day I'll wonder if you still think of me
And I know it sounds trite
But you made impossible possible sometimes
Felling all, all that emotion
Feeling all the chemicals
Feeling all, all the commotion
Feeling all the chemicals
Come in here my love
Take me farther
Cause it's always reminding me how
How it hits harder
So I'll stay here for you
With a little paranoia
Its only love if you fall and I'm no wiser
And then one day I'll find you underneath my skin
And I know it sounds trite
But you made impossible possible sometimes
Felling all, all that emotion
Feeling all the chemicals
Feeling all, all the commotion
Feeling all the chemicals
No offence, it's not what I meant
Settle the rest before bed
Lighted a candle for it
But it burned me
Felling all all that emotion
Feeling all the chemicals
Feeling all all the commotion
Feeling all the chemicals
(Am I dreaming, am I dreaming)
