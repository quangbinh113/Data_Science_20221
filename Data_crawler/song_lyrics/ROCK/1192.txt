Song Name: Don't Stop... - Demo
One, two, three
Two, two, three
Bye, bye my friend I'm leaving
I'm gonna feast on the stars in the sky
While I'll be gone don't stop dreaming
And don't be sad and don't cry
'Cause lazy days and sunny rays will guide me
Back home to where I belong
If god gives me grace then he will find me a space
And I hope I'll be singing this song
Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life
It's alright to hold back the night
Lazy days and sunny rays will guide me
Back home to where I belong
If god gives me grace then he will find me a space
And I hope I'll be singing this song
Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life
It's alright to hold back the night
From time to time
Though we're whole worlds apart
You will still hold a groove in my heart
From time to time
We will fall side by side
You'll still have that look in your eye
Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life
It's alright to hold back the night
It's alright to hold back the night
It's alright to hold back the night
