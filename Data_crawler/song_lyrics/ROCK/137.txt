Song Name: The Shower Scene
Come on in, the weather's dreadful
We always have a room to spare
Don't mind mother, she is not well
The doctors say she's not all there
She's crazy, I must confess
I'm so sick of cleaning up her mess
I hope saying goodnight
Doesn't mean saying goodbye
Now under the pressure, we're drowning together
Going down the drain tonight (the drain tonight)
Come on back, I'll fix you something
Be careful not to cross the line
'Cause she and I are sure of one thing
(We all go a little mad sometimes)
She's crazy, I must confess
(Listen to mother)
It's always me cleaning up her mess
I hope saying goodnight
Doesn't mean saying goodbye
Now under the pressure, we're drowning together
Going down the drain tonight (the drain tonight)
(The drain tonight)
I can't come clean
You got caught up in-between
I can't come clean
You can't escape the shower scene
You can't escape the shower scene
The shower scene
It's always me cleaning up her mess
I hope saying goodnight
Doesn't mean saying goodbye
Now under the pressure, we're drowning together
Going down the drain tonight (the drain tonight)
The drain tonight
(Down the drain tonight)
Can I help you, sir?
Sure hope you can
I'm looking for a young woman who's been missing for several days now
I have reason to believe she may have stopped off at this very motel
