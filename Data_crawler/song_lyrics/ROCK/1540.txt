Song Name: Octopus's Garden - Remastered 2009
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
He'd let us in
Knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden
In the shade
I'd ask my friends
To come and see
An octopus' garden
With me
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would be warm
Below the storm
In our little hideaway
Beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the seabed
In an octopus' garden
Near a cave
We would sing
And dance around
Because we know
We can't be found
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would shout
And swim about
The coral that lies
Beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy
For every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy
And they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy
You and me
No one there to tell us
What to do
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden
With you
