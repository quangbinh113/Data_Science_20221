Song Name: Unstoppable
You're never gonna stop me
I'm the nightmare you've been dreaming of
And the day is approaching
Let me show you what I'm made of
This is just the beginning
Your entirety is justified
Let me tell you something
There's nowhere left for you to hide
Justice will be mine
You can be certain
That sound of your heartbeat
Like a time bomb slowly ticking down
You won't see me coming
I can end your life with not a sound
Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I've fulfilled my vow
There's no escape
I am unstoppable
I am unstoppable
There can be no penance
For the parasite that you've become
There is no repentance
This judgment can't be undone
There will be no mercy
No lenience while I'm alive
Vengeance is coming
Believe it now, you won't survive
Justice will be mine
You can be certain
That sound of your heartbeat
Like a time bomb slowly ticking down
You won't see me coming
I can end your life with not a sound
Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I've fulfilled my vow
I am unstoppable
Don't bother running
It's over this time
You're going to pay now
For all you have taken
Hear me now
There's no escape
I am unstoppable
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I am
I am unstoppable
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I am
I am unstoppable
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I am
I am unstoppable
Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I've fulfilled my vow
I am unstoppable
Don't bother running, it's over this time
You're going to pay now for all you have taken
Hear me now
There's no escape
I am unstoppable
You're never gonna stop me
I am unstoppable
You're never gonna stop me
I am unstoppable
