Song Name: Ramble On - 1990 Remaster
Leaves are fallin' all around
Time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it, pain
And it's headed my way
Oh, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams
Got no time to for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And though our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the Evil One
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
And ain't nothin' I can do, no
I guess I'll keep on
Ramblin', I'm gonna
Sing my song, I've gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way all around the world
Baby, baby, ramble on, yeah
A-do-do-n-do-n-do-n-do, my baby, baby
A-ramble on, baby
A-do-do-do-do
I can't stop this feelin' in my heart
Everytime I feel I will leave, I really gotta part
Gotta keep searchin' for my baby (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
I've gotta keep a-searchin' for (baby)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my baby
Yeah-yeah, a-yeah-yeah, a-yeah-yeah
My, my, my, my, my, my baby
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Ooh, my, my
I can't find my bluebird, I'd listen to my bluebird sing
But I, I can't find my bluebird
I keep a-ramblin' baby
Ah, yeah
I keep a-ramblin', baby
I keep, keep...
