Song Name: Fireball - 1996 Remaster
The golden light above you
Shows me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches
All you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill
And be bop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you
Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way
I tried to understand you
I tried to love you right
The way you smile and touch me
Always sets my heart alight
Your lips are like a fire
Burning through my soul
And people ask me where you're from
They really wanna know
Oh, my soul, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way
Magic woman, wreckin' up my soul
Things you tell me have never been told
Magic woman, I don't know
Electric before me, I love you so, I love you so, oh, oh oh
You're racing like a fireball
Dancing like a ghost
You're Gemini and I don't know
Which one I like the most
My head is getting broken
And my mind is getting bust
But now I'm coming with you
Down the road of golden dust
Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way
The golden light above you
Shows me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches
All you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill
And be bop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you
Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way
