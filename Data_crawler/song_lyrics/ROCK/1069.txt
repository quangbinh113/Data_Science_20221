Song Name: You Can't Always Get What You Want
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you find
You get what you need
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need
Oh yeah, baby
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50 amp fuse"
Sing it to me, ladies
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well you just might find
You get what you need
Oh, baby, yeah
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy, yeah
And he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him
You can't always get what you want, Lord
You can't always get what you want, I tell you, baby
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need
Oh, yes
Woah
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby
Oh, forget it
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
You can't always get what you want, yeah
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find you get what you need, oh yeah
You can't always get what you want, no, no
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find you get what you need
Oh, yeah
Oh, you get what you need
