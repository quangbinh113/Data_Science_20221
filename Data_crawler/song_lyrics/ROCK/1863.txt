Song Name: Heatseeker
Oooh, we're gettin' ready
Ow
Here we go
Hahaha
I'm ready
Oooh, yeah
Gettin' ready to rock
Gettin' ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal
I gotta keep that motor turning
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker
Charging up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down
Gettin' ready to break
Gettin' ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow
You gotta keep that woman firin'
You gotta keep that serpent clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream
'Cause I'm a heatseeker
Burning up the town
And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down
Aw yeah, here ya go
Ready? Heatseeker!
I wanna see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes
And I'm a heatseeker, heatseeker, yeah!
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size
And I'm a heatseeker
Gotta keep that motor turning
You gotta keep that engine clean
You gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Woah, I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker
Out on the street feel the heat...
