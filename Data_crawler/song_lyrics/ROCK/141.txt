Song Name: Fear the Sun
Bones scattered piece by piece
How far do you think I fell?
Almost a hundred million miles from myself
Find the pieces, pick up all the pieces
Find the pieces, pick up all the pieces
Find the pieces, pick up all the pieces
And lose them day by day
Fear the sun, the light can disorient
In the dark, we can't be poisoned
It's gravity that makes us weak
World gets spun, hold on and enjoy it
Pain so sharp, it's hard to avoid it
It's gravity that makes us weak
Lights go out, so no one's watching
Dripping down, the sky is falling
Birds are screaming, ears are throbbing
Apocalyptic, I'm the target, yeah
Life, it builds what we become
Crack until we come undone
Sun shines down while we succumb
Kids get shot by guys with guns
Feed us pill to keep us dumb
Wanna say more, but I'll bite my tongue (bite my tongue)
Fear the sun, the light can disorient
In the dark, we can't be poisoned
It's gravity that makes us weak
World gets spun, hold on and enjoy it
Pain so sharp, it's hard to avoid it
It's gravity that makes us weak
Blackout to go blind again
Burn glass to numb my heart
Fill the void until the end
Build walls to tear apart
In the dark, we can't be poisoned
It's gravity that makes us weak
Fear the sun, the light can disorient
In the dark, we can't be poisoned
It's gravity that makes us weak
