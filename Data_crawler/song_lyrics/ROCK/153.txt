Song Name: Hold On (feat. Lacey Sturm)
(Whoa, whoa)
(Ohh-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa)
One more door closing in your face
One more loss that you can't replace
One less reason to keep on trying
One more drink from whoever is buying
The world keeps getting bigger
While you shrink
The earth is spinning quicker
You can't think
The motion makes you sicker
Makes you weak
You're fighting for air
But you just need to breathe
You'll make it out stronger
There could be a light at the tunnel's end
We'll find a way out just around the bend
A reason to live again
Just hold on a little bit longer
We can make it up
If we don't look down
You're never gonna know if you let go now
So if you can somehow
Just hold on a little bit longer
Got your back
We're by your side
'Cause the war within is the hardest fight
And if the path looks clear walking off that ledge
Don't trust the signs through the clouds in your head
It's gonna blow over
There could be a light at the tunnel's end
We'll find a way out just around the bend
A reason to live again
Just hold on a little bit longer
We can make it up
If we don't look down
You're never gonna know if you let go now
So if you can somehow
Just hold on a little bit longer
Don't give up, I know you've had enough
(Hold on a little bit longer)
Lock your grip till your fingernails cut
(Hold on a little bit longer)
So close, it's too late for leaving
(Hold on a little bit longer)
Till every bone in your body is screaming
(Whoa, whoa)
Your demons in the mirror always talking you down
Your ghosts are always haunting you and hanging around
It's only 'cause they know you're close to breaking out
They can scream
They can shout
But you're leaving them for good now
(Whoa)
There could be a light at the tunnel's end
We'll find a way out just around the bend
A reason to live again
Just hold on a little bit longer
We can make it up
If we don't look down
You're never gonna know if you let go now
So if you can somehow
Just hold on a little bit longer
Don't give up, I know you've had enough
(Hold on a little bit longer)
Lock your grip till your fingernails cut
(Hold on a little bit longer)
So close, it's too late for leaving
(Hold on a little bit longer)
Till every bone in your body is screaming
(Whoa, whoa)
