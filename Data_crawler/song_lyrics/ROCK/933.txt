Song Name: Women - Remastered 2017
OOH WE OOH
OOH WEE OOH
In the very beginning
God made the land
Then he made the Waters, and creatures
Then He made Man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit, with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So He came up with the answer, here's what it cost:
One part love, one part wild
One part lady, one part child, I give you
WOMEN! WOMEN! - Lots of pretty women
MEN! MEN! - We can't live without them
WOMEN! WOMEN! - Lots of pretty women
MEN! MEN! - We can't live without them
And in the Garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion, he took a bite
It was one part love, one part wild
One part lady, one part child, I give you
WOMEN! WOMEN! - Lots of pretty women
MEN! MEN! - We can't live without them
WOMEN! WOMEN! - Lots of pretty women
MEN! MEN! - We can't live without them
Skin on skin, let the love begin
WOMEN!
It was one part love, one part wild
One part lady, one part child,
A whole llot of passion, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice
I give you...
Hair, eyes skin on skin
Legs, thighs, what's that spell?
What's that spell?
WOMEN! WOMEN
OH! OH! OH!
OH! OH! OH!
WOMEN! WOMEN - Callin every girl
WOMEN! WOMEN! - All around the world
WOMEN! WOMEN! Oh we can't live woithout them
WOMEN! WOMEN! OH!
