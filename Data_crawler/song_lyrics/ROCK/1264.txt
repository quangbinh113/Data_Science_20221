Song Name: Tie Your Mother Down - Remastered 2011
Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
School babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm burnin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out alright
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grusslin'
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Your mommy and your daddy gonna
Plague me 'til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big, big daddy outta doors!
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
