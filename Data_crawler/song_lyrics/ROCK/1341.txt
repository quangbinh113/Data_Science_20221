Song Name: Dazed and Confused - 1990 Remaster
Been dazed and confused
For so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lotsa people talkin'
Few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah
You hurt and abuse
Tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again
Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're goin'
Only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again
(That's not my babe)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(Did you ever look up my woman)
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby
Let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
Oh, yeah, alright
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
