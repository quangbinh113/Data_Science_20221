Song Name: kickball
We were playing kickball in the summer
When you first learned my name
In the parking lot of the Catholic school
Where the boys misbehaved
I didn't wanna call home to my mother no I
Just told my teammates to wait
Picked the asphalt out of my kneecaps until
All my nerves went away
Guess I
I guess I never had it in me
Was trying so hard to be happy
Thought you were everything I wanted
But then it should've been so easy
Threw an end of the year party
Back at my parents' house
You left early for some friend's going away
And I never mentioned it
I told you green was my favorite color
Just so that we'd be the same
Never wanted to cause any trouble
Until the seasons changed
Guess I
I guess I never had it in me
Was trying so hard to be happy
Thought you were everything I wanted
But then it should've been so easy
Guess I
I guess I never had it in me
Was trying so hard to be happy
Thought you were everything I wanted
But then it should've been so easy
