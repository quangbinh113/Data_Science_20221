Song Name: 2,000 Man
Well, my name it is a number
It's on a piece of plastic film
And I've been growin' funny flowers
Outside on my little window sill
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
You know, my wife still respects me
Even though I really misuse her
I am having an affair
With a random computer
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'
Like they did when you were young?
Or did they come down crashin'
Seein' all the things you'd done?
Spacin' out and havin' fun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'
Like they did when you were young?
Or did they come down crashin'
Seein' all the things you'd done?
Spacin' out and havin' fun
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
Understand me
Understand me
Understand me
Now understand me
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know?
I'm a 2000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
I'm a 2000 man
I'm a 2000 man
I'm a 2000 man
I'm a 2000 man
I'm a 2000 man
Yeah, 2000
