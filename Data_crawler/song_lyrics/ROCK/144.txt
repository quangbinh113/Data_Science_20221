Song Name: City Of The Dead
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where we all wear crowns upon our head
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where the lost are found, in peace we rest
She said there was a place
Where every single person had the same face
So she fled, and I stayed
The life in her eyes seemed to fade away
She sold all her bones for the money
And I'm fucking stoned, ain't it lovely?
So why is my soul so hungry for a broken heart?
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where we all wear crowns upon our head
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where the lost are found, in peace we rest
There goes the sun
I've come undone
There goes the sun
I've come undone
Two empty eyes, that old reflection of mine
Pleading for a reason, I always leave 'em behind
But I don't think I'm gonna make it out, no, not this time
This rope's a little tight, my feet are scraping the skyline
Spitting up this blood again so I can bring back the flood again
Noah's Ark is sinking in, I'm thinking about the end, my friend
I never meant to hurt nobody, I just wanna be somebody
I'm here way down below, all you living look so lovely
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where we all wear crowns upon our heads
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where the lost are found, in peace we rest
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where we all wear crowns upon our head
Welcome to the city of the dead
Where the lost are found, in peace we rest
There goes the sun
I've come undone
There goes the sun
I've come undone
