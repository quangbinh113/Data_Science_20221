Song Name: The Perfume of Decay
You're so natural
Perfectly ineffable
You're so natural
Something inexplicable
Oh I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake (I shake)
And I shiver (I shake)
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the
You're so extrovert
Excellent in every world
You're so beautiful
It hits me with a thousand tonnes
Oh I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake (I shake)
And I shiver (I shake)
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
Oh I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
I shake (I shake)
And I shiver (I shake)
When my back's against the wall
I shake and I shiver
When my back's against the wall
