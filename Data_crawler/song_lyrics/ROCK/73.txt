Song Name: I Am The Weapon
Who would I be if I never met
A teacher, priest, or a prophet?
What do I need, tell me what does it mean
Am I living or dying the dream?
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
By a world I can't unsee
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
Look what you've done to me
I was a target
I was the mission
You had the power
The ammunition
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
Your concept of love
And your hunger for war
Tell me which one should I die for
Cause I am the product
I how I was brought up
The cycle spins out of control
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
By a world I can't unsee
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
Look what you've done to me
I was a target
I was the mission
You had the power
The ammunition
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
Am I living or dying the dream?
Am i living or dying the dream
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
By a world I can't unsee
Youth is broken
Half of it was stolen
Look what you've done to me
I was a target
I was the mission
You had the power
The ammunition
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
Now I'm the message
This is a lesson
Here in the present
I am the weapon
