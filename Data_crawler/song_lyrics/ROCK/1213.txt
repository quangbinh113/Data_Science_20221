Song Name: Rip This Joint
Mama says yes, Papa says no
Make up you mind 'cause I gotta go
I'm gonna raise hell at the Union Hall
Drive myself right over the wall
Rip this joint, gonna save your soul
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Roll this joint, gonna get down low
Start my starter, gonna stop the show
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
From San Jose down to Santa Fe
Kiss me quick, baby, won'tcha make my day
New Orleans with the Dixie Dean
Across to Dallas, Texas with the Butter Queen
Rip this joint, gonna get down low
Start my starter, going to stop the show
Gonna roll this joint, gonna get down low
'Round and 'round and 'round we'll go
Ying yang, you're my thing
Oh, now, baby, won't you hear me sing
Flip flop, fit to drop
Come on baby, won't you let it rock?
Mister President, Mister Immigration Man
Let me in, sweetie, to your fair land
I'm Tampa bound and Memphis too
Short Fat Fanny is on the loose
Rip this joint, gonna get down low
Then slip it right across into Buffalo
Gonna roll this joint, gonna get down low
'Round and 'round and 'round we'll go
Wham, bam, Birmingham
Alabama don't give a damn
Little Rock fit to drop
Ah, should just let it rock
