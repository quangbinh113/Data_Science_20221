Song Name: Freak
Say what you want to me
Got no apologies
Maybe I'm a freak in the crowd
Take what you want from me
Give no apologies
Saying what I'm thinking out loud
I'd die to be crashing
A shipwreck in your sea
But I'm a freak
Always gonna be a good for nothing freak
Tell me would you like to learn to love a freak
I don't really care what you think of me I
Know I'm just a perfect freak
Woah
Know I'm just a perfect freak
Woah
Know I'm just the perfect
Freak
Hear what you wanna hear
Truth might be what you fear
Going deaf and freaking you out
Leave if you wanna leave
Leave me in ecstasy
I'm high don't go bringing me down
I'd die to be crashing
A shipwreck in your sea
But I'm a freak
Always gonna be a good for nothing freak
Tell me would you like to learn to love a freak
I don't really care what you think of me I
Know I'm just a perfect freak
Woah
Know I'm just a perfect freak
Woah
Know I'm just the perfect
Loser a sucker oh mother I can't stay here
Fighting these words in my head
You're just a freak
Lover a fighter but I can't fight no longer
Maybe it's time to accept
That I'm a freak
A good for nothing
Freak
I love to be a
Freak
I don't care what you think of me I know I'm just a
Perfect
Freak
Always gonna be a good for nothing freak
Tell me would you like to learn to love a freak
I don't really care what you think of me I
Know I'm just a perfect
Freak
Always gonna be a good for nothing freak
Tell me would you like to learn to love a freak
I don't really care what you think of me I
Know I'm just a perfect
Freak
