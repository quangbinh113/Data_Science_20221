Song Name: I'm so Bored with the U.S.A. - Remastered
Yankee soldier, he wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia but now he can't afford a bag
Yankee dollar talk to the dictators of the world
In fact it's giving orders an' they can't afford to miss a word
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
But what can I do?
Yankee detectives are always on the TV
'Cause killers in America work seven days a week
Never mind the stars and stripes let's print the Watergate Tapes
I'll salute the New Wave and I hope nobody escapes
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
But what can I do?
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
But what can I do?
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
I'm so bored with the U. S. A.
But what can I do?
Move up Starsky for the C.I.A.
Suck on Kojak for the USA
