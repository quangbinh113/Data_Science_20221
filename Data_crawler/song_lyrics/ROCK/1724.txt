Song Name: Seven Wonders - 2017 Remaster
So long ago
Certain place, certain time
You touched my hand all the way
All the way down to Emmeline
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry but
If I live to see the Seven Wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me
But if our paths never cross
Well, no I'm not sorry but
If I live to see the Seven Wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end
So long ago
It's a certain time, it's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back, you held out your hand
But I hope, and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday
If I live to see the Seven Wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the Seven Wonders (if I live to see the Seven Wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(That same, same beauty again)
If I live to see the Seven Wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again (well if I hope and I pray, well)
(Maybe it might work out someday)
If I live to see the Seven Wonders (if I live to see the Seven Wonders)
