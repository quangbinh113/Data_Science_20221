Song Name: Like You
There's no escape the world they simulate
They want a hold of you to dominate
And I try to abide
So I won't be denied
Like you
I wonder what sits on the other side
I take off all my clothes and all these ties
And I start to cry
When they all see my eyes
Like you, (like you)
Like you, (like you)
Like you, (like you)
Like you, (like you)
Bore new
Everything is see-through
Confused
They might see they're like you
Bore new
Everything is see-through
Confused
They might see they're like you
Bore new
Everything is see-through
Confused
They might see they're like you
