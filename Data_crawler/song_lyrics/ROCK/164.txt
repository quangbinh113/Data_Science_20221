Song Name: You Made Me Want To Live
You gave me a life
Took away the pain
Why did it have to be?
Now there's nothing here for me
You made me want to live
You took it all away
So hard to forgive
You made me want to live
Crushed by loss
Saddened by the news
The sun no longer shines
Upon this life that I once knew
I guess I'll never know
Why you had to leave
You made my heart so full
Your love was all I'd ever need
You made me want to live
You took it all away
So hard to forgive
You made me want to live
You made me want to live
You made me want to live
You made me want to live
You took it all away
So hard to forgive
You made me want to live
You took it all away
So hard to forgive
You made me wanna live
