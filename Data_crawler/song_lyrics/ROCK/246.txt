Song Name: Bones
My heart is hidden, forbidden
Can't be forgiven, all the faith is on the line
The end is written, I pretend
It's a mistake, I orchestrate my own decline
You think you know me, you hold me
Just like you own me, living in a perfect lie
I face the karma for all the pain and drama
I feel like I was buried alive
And every time you kiss me
My heart turns into stone
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bones
My bones
I hide a secret so twisted
It hurts to keep it quiet deep inside my mind
I've been mistaken, forsaken
There's no escaping, something keeps me up at night
I crawl in her bed
I feel no regret
I hear your voice inside my head
'Cause I betrayed you
In your weakest moment
I know that I deserve to be dead
And every time you kiss me
My heart turns into stone
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bones
When you hold me
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bones
My bones
My bones
