Song Name: Mean Streak
She came home last night, rockin' rollin' drunk
She talk no sense but she sound good so she thunk
So I reached over and said, "Hello
There's some planet you'd care to go?"
And she said, "Venus on the rocks"
So I said "She got a mean streak"
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She drive me crazy gets inside my brain
She spun my money down the drain, ohh
So I roll over for my reward
How much can I afford?
She says, "Just a little more"
You know, she got a mean streak
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She got a mean streak
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
I can't take this no more
Tried so hard but I can't get through the door
Because one smile from those eyes
And I stand there paralyzed
And she says, "You better beg for more I mean
Get down sucker you know what I like"
Woo hang on
Black mamba don't compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She got a mean streak
Black mamba don't compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
Mean streak, ooo
(Ooo)
Mean streak, ooo
She got a mean streak
(Yea ooo)
She got a mean streak
And I'm telling you
Mean streak
Ohh ohh ohh
Mean streak, ooo
Mean streak
She's got a mean streak
