Song Name: I Wanna Be Sedated
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just get me to the airport, pput me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh-oh, oh-oh
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh-oh, oh-oh
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh-oh, oh-oh
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh-oh, oh-oh
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
