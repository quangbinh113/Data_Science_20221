Song Name: 84
Disaster dyed my mind black
With no time to brace for the impact
How'd you make my heart bloody?
Hands cold
I draped the blindfold
And I rescued my soul
These voices livin' in my ear
Forever whisperin' thoughts I regret hearing
I admit that I am brainwashed
And mind-fucked
Words meant to destruct
Erasing me
Remember who I was before?
I used to be so pure, so protected
Subconsciously, an endless war
I'm self rejected
Take me back to '84
Take me back to '84
Self sabotage is wearin' on me
And what I've become is a shadow debris
I'm fractured by you
Manufactured into
A creature I can't recognize
Remember who I was before?
I used to be so pure, so protected
Subconsciously, an endless war
I'm self rejected
Take me back to '84
Remember, who I was before
That person you dragged on the bedroom floor
