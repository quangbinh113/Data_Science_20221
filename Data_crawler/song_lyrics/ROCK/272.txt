Song Name: Find Life
The air is purified
I step on solemn ground
But it is not enough, no
'Cause not yet satisfied
'Till I see that flash in your eyes
Reversed indifference
And you can not deny
What I have sacrificed
An unsuspecting side of you
A blackened paradise
Feel the corruption rise
A billion souls adrift
But life can save us
Come and you'll find
The temptation of human desire
Rise, high
Come, find life
I tried with all my might
Crossed to the other side
Suspended disbelief, oh
A resurrection of
Of the principles of what's right
A jester's theory
And so I have denied
Disrupted paradise
I taste the serpents bite in you
The madman prophesies
Apocalyptic skies
A billion souls adrift
But life can save us
Come and you'll find
The temptation of human desire
Rise, high
Come, find life
Life can save us now
Life can save us
Come and you'll find
The temptation of human desire
Rise, high
Come, find life
Come, intertwine
Conflagration I thrive in the fire
Rise, high
Come, find life
