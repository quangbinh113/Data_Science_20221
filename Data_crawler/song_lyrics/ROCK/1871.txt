Song Name: Have Mercy Judge
Have mercy, I'm in a world of trouble now
I'm being held by the State Patrol
I am charged with traffic of the forbidden
And I almost finished doing my parole
Now, I'm on my way back downtown
Somebody help me, have mercy on my soul
I go to court tomorrow morning
And I got the same judge I had before
Lord, and I know he won't have no mercy on me
'Cause he told me not to come back no more
He'll send me away to some stoney mansion
In a lonely room and lock the door
Oh Lord, have mercy on my little Tulane
She's too alive to try to live alone
And I know her needs
And although she loves me
She wanna try to make it
While the poor boy's gone
She can't do it alone
Somebody should tell her to leave
And I'll understand it
And even love her more
When I come back home
