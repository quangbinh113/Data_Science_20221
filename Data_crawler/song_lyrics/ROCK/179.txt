Song Name: NOCTURNAL
Tried self-destruction 'til I couldn't function
I hurt myself, hated myself, it didn't help me
Tried self-control, tried letting go
To heal myself, I went to hell, I hope you know
What it's like to fight your mind
When your skin still crawls at night
I pretend that I'm alright
'Til the lights go out
Don't got a need for sleep
Stuck in a lucid dream
Daylight's not for me
That's why I'm nocturnal
Hate when the morning comes
It's light that I'm running from
Can't fly too close to the sun
That's why I'm nocturnal
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, that's why I'm nocturnal
Lost in the static, I can't move past it
I got this far, I need the dark, a little madness
A little patience, some kind of saving
Keep circling to find another light worth chasing
I pretend that I'm alright
'Til the lights go out
Don't got a need for sleep
Stuck in a lucid dream
Daylight's not for me
That's why I'm nocturnal
Hate when the morning comes
It's light that I'm running from
Can't fly too close to the sun
That's why I'm nocturnal
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, that's why I'm nocturnal
That's why I'm nocturnal
That's why I'm nocturnal
I pretend that I'm alright
