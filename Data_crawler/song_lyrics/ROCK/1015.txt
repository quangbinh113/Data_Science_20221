Song Name: Cold Gin
Alright! C'mon!
My heater's broke. I'm so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it always wins
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together
It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
The cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together
Whoa!
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together
