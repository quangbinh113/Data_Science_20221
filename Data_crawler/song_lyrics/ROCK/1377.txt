Song Name: Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)
People talkin', but they just don't know, What's in my heart, and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
Come on sugar, let the good times roll
Hey
So many people live in make-believe, They keep a lot 'a' going up their sleeves
But my love baby is no kind that folds
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Hey! Hey baby, let the good times roll
Oh, let them baby
Common let that into your soul
Oh baby, let the good times roll
A love is nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
Come on Sugar, let the good times roll
Hey, let the good times roll
Hey what do you mean baby, let the good times roll
No longer let the living soul
Hey, let the good time roll
