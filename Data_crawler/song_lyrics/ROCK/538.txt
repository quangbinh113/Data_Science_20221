Song Name: You Give Love A Bad Name
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darlin', you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me Heaven, then put me through Hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Whoa-oh-oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
Hey, you give love
A bad name
(Aw!) Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A schoolboy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa-oh-oh, you're a loaded gun
Whoa-oh-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
You give love, oh
Oh
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
You give love (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love, bad name (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love, bad name (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love, bad name (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You give love, bad name (whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh)
