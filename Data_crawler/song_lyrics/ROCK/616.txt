Song Name: Hit the Road Jack
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
(What'd you say?)
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
Woah, woman, oh, woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
(What'd you say?)
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
Now, baby, listen, baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(You ain't got no money, you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
(What'd you say?)
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more
Well (don't you come back no more)
Uh, what'd you say? (Don't you come back no more)
I didn't understand it! (Don't you come back no more)
You can't mean that! (Don't you come back no more)
Oh, now, baby, please! (Don't you come back no more)
What you tryin' to do to me? (Don't you come back no more)
Oh, don't hurt me like that!
