Song Name: Tumbling Dice
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
Make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, don't need jewels in my crown
All of you women, low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
Baby, I go crazy, fever in the funk house now
Low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
Know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, I can't say
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, I can't say
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' your field every night
Baby, I can't say
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me, ah-ooh yeah
Got to roll me, ah-ooh
Got to roll me, ah yeah
Got to roll me, keep on rollin'
Got to roll me, keep on rollin'
Got to roll me, keep on rollin'
Got to roll me, my women call me the tumblin' dice
Got to roll me, yeah
Got to roll me, oh baby be my sugar
Got to roll me, ahh yeah
Got to roll me, oh my, my, my
Got to roll me, oh my
Got to roll me, ah good job baby
Got to roll me, good job baby
Got to roll me, baby I'm down
Got to roll me
