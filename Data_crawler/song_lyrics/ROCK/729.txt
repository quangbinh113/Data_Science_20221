Song Name: You Can't Hurry Love - 2016 Remaster
I need love, love
Ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine
My mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes
Oh how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find new love to let me live again
Right now, the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
Well, it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes
Now break
Now love, love it don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Ooh, until that day
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy
My mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
Well it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
Well it's a game of give and take
