Song Name: When I Needed You
Ever wondered how we all get through
Maybe someone's watching over you
All the shit that we face everyday
Somehow works itself out anyway
In the back of a stolen car
Doin' 80 with the headlights off
That's when I needed you
Ever wondered how we all get through
Maybe someone's watching over you
When the ground is falling fast beneath
You somehow find yourself back on your feet
In the middle of a shady bar
Broken bottles flying through the air
That's when I needed you
Out of my sorrows
Livin' out hollow steel
I look through old photos
For hours and hours
In the back of a stolen car
Doin' 80 with the headlights off
That's when I needed you
Ohh...
That's when I needed you
