Song Name: Oh Well (Pt. 1) - 2013 Remaster
I can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh, well
Now when I talked to God, I knew he'll understand
He said, "Sit by me and I'll be your guiding hand
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Mm-mm-mm, yeah
