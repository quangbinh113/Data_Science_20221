Song Name: Natural Born Killer
I've been having dreams about falling in love
It feels so real but nobody is here when I wake up
Do you know my name?
The devil's in the detail
I'm a natural born killer
I'm a natural born
Take this
Hopeless
Broken soul of this
Remote control
Plot twist
A whole generation lost with no promise
Can you feel my love?
Do you know my pain?
It's in my head every night I replay
A deadly game
For a natural born killer
I'm a natural born killer
Natural born killer
Okay
It's game face
Go time
Don't play
Never stand
In place
Just move
So don't wait
'Cause all day
They'll say
Nice work
But no pay
Good game
Pump fame
Reach out
Touch faith
Can you feel my heart?
Do you know my name?
Can you feel my love?
Do you know my pain?
I'll tear it all apart
It's a crying shame
The devil's in the detail
Detail's my name
I'm a killer
Natural born killer
So I'm a killer (whoo!)
Natural born killer, yeah
Supernatural form villain
Villain
