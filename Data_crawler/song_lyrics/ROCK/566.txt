Song Name: Times Like These - Acoustic Version
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm a road that drives away
Follows you back home

I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off and on
Oh-oh-ohh
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang
The stars upon tonight

I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away
Leave it all behind?
Oh-oh-ohh
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again
(Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Ah-ah-ah
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time, time again
