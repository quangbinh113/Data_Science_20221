Song Name: Get Back - Remastered 2009
Rosetta
Sweet Loretta Fart, she thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan (Rosetta Martin)
Yeah (who's asking?)
(The pitcher) the picker!
Picture the fingers growing
Okay?
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta
Go home
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Thanks, Mo!
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group
And ourselves and I hope we passed the audition!
