Song Name: This is War
A brood of vipers, they are scheming as the west winds blow
They are conspiring from below
A raging fire from the depths of hell, a wicked foe
Unleash the tiger, take control
It's time to decide
Do not play the fool
So fight for your life, can't you see what's coming?
Fight for your mind, this is war
Fight from inside and believe in something
Don't compromise who you are
An army of shadows, they are waiting for the battle call
Bloodthirsty demons of the mind
They will unravel if you let them, everything you are
And storm the castle from inside
So open your eyes
So fight for your life, can't you see what's coming?
Fight for your mind, this is war
Fight from inside and believe in something
Don't compromise who you are
Scheming, haunting, waiting, taunting
Taking every good man down
A raging fire from the depths of hell, a wicked foe
Unleash the tiger, take control
And fight for your life, can't you see what's coming?
Fight for your mind, this is war
Fight from inside and believe in something
Don't compromise who you are
