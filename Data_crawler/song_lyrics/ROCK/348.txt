Song Name: Kerosene
Kill me, I wanna feeling something
There's nothing, nothing left inside of me
Kerosene all over my body
Light it up and swallow me
I feel somehow another hit will fix me
And take me away
When I get so high, so high
I'm so far out that I cannot find myself now
Sickness all up in my head
And coming to terms with the idea of death
And losing everything I love
Swallows me entirely, yeah
I feel somehow another hit will fix me
And make me feel alright
And just for tonight
Will you be by my side
When I get so high, so high
I'm so far out that I cannot find myself now
When I get so high, so high
I'm so far out that I cannot find myself now
