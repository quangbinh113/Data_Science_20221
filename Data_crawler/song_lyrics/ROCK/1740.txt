Song Name: Family Man - 2017 Remaster
Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down (I fall down)
I get up
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
Mother... Father... Brother
Mother... Father... Brother
Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what's right
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
Mother... Father... Brother
Mother... Father... Brother
(Am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
(Am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (a family man)
Mother... Father... Brother
Mother... Father... Brother
