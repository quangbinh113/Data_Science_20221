Song Name: 7 and 7 Is
When I was a boy, I thought about the times I'd be a man
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in the can
But here in my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
You can throw me if you wanna, cause I'm a bone and I go
Oop-ip-ip, oop-ip-ip, yeah!
Well if I don't start crying it's because that I have got no eyes
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way
I'm trapped inside a night, but I'm a day and I go
Oop-ip-ip, oop-ip-ip, yeah!
