Song Name: James Dean - 2013 Remaster
James Dean
James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean
You said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the low-down rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause, James Dean
You said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean
James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean
You said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean up on the screen
Wonderin' who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
Took him down the road to eternity
James Dean
James Dean
You bought it, sight unseen
James Dean
James Dean
You bought it, sight unseen
You were too fast to live
Too young to die, bye bye
You were too fast to live
Too young to die, bye bye (bye bye)
Too fast to live, too young to die (bye bye)
Too fast to live, too young to die (bye bye)
Too fast to live, too young to die (bye bye)
Too fast to live, too young to die
Too fast to live, too young to die
Too fast to live, too young to die (bye bye bye)
Too fast to live, too young to die (oh, James Dean)
Too fast to live, too young to die (bye bye)
