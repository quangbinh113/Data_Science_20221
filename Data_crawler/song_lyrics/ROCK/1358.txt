Song Name: I Can't Quit You Baby - 1990 Remaster
I, I can't quit you, babe
So I'm gonna put you down for a while
I said I can't quit you, baby
I guess I got to put you down for a while
Said, you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yes, you did, babe
Oh, said, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, babe
My love for you I could never hide
And when I feel you near me, little girl
I know you are my one desire
Whoa-oh
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh, that's wonderful
When you hear me moanin' and groanin', baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moanin' and groanin', babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me hollar, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are
Oh, alright
