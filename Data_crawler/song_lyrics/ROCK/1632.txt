Song Name: London's Burning - Remastered
London's burning!
London's burning!
All across the town, all across the night
Everybody's drivin' with full headlight
Black or white you turn it on, or face the new religion
Everybody's sittin' 'round watchin' television
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
I'm up and down the West way, in an' out the light
What a great traffic system it's so bright
I can't think of a better way to spend the night
Then speedin' around underneath the yellow lights
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
Now I'm in the subway and I'm looking for the flat
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that
The wind howls through the empty block lookin' for a home
I run through the empty stone 'cause I'm all alone
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
London's burnin'
(With boredom now)
London's burnin'
(Dial nine nine nine nine nine)
Here we go, here we go
Here we go rocking down the West London motorway
And on your left you'll see the tower blocks
Built in 1963
With hard cash payments from the GLC
And over there you'll see Westbourne Park
You don't wanna go there
When it gets dark
London's burnin'
