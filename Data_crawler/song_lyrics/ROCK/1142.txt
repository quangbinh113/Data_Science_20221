Song Name: We'll Burn the Sky - 2015 - Remaster
I'm in love
With the sunshine
I'm in love with the falling rain
Everything
Seems to call your name
Yesterday
You were leaving
Leaving life and all the pain
Everything
Wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again
I've found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carried all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart
My dreams recall
Us being one
I've searched for you
To be free
My force of life
You have always been
I Feel blue
Since you've gone
Your breath of love
Surrounded me
When can I
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free
Wait, can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way
To stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are in my other heart
I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time
For me to die
We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky
Oh, yeah!
