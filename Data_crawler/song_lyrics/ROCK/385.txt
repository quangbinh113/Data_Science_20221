Song Name: Decay
(Great)
It's hard to be a decent human being these days
When all we've done wrong is all I remember, yeah
All we've done wrong is all I remember
All we've done wrong is all I remember
You and I kissing the sky
Letting the words go by
All we've done wrong is how I remember, yeah
It's looking like they'll all be Indian summers these days
Goodbye clear conscience, you were my blissful fate
Decay, hey, aye
All we've done wrong is all I remember
All we've done wrong is all I remember
You and I kissing the sky
Letting the words go by
All we've done wrong is how I remember, yeah
Decay, hey, aye
Decay, hey, aye
Let's go
Oh, oh
Decay, hey, aye
Decay, hey, aye
