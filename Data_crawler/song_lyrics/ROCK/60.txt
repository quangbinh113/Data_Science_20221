Song Name: JACK
Hey kid let me introduce myself
I's a friend of your dad's when he had no one else
I'll put the party in your life boy you know I can
Have you ever wanted to feel like superman
Oh, Oh
I see that blonde hair over there looking at you
You wanna say what's up but can't work up the courage to
But if you stick with me buddy you can bet your life
She'll be walking out with you by the end of the night so
Don't listen to momma
Hell I ain't the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need alittle
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is... Shit
It ain't my place but I gotta admit
All the people in your circle man they're pissing me off
Say you're broken and you're soulless and it's all my fault
So tell me old friend, is it such a sin
All I did was make you happy so to hell with them and
Don't listen to momma
Hell I ain't the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need a little
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is... Yeah
Yeah yeah it's been a hell of a ride kid don't you agree
Yeah yeah rock bottom ain't as bad when you're rocking with me
When you're rocking with me
So
Don't listen to momma
Hell I ain't the devil
Ditch me when you wanna
But if you need a little
I can fix your problems
Always got your back
I can make you famous
By the way my name is...
By the way my name is...
By the way my name is
Jack
