Song Name: Monster
(La la la la la la)
(La la la la la la)
Sometimes it feels like a movie
And I don't have any lines
I was never good enough, no
I could never memorize
Sometimes I feel like a stranger
Living somebody else's life
Staring at the mirror again
Try to recognize
But I'm so sick of all these changes
I wish that I could stop the clocks and rewind
So buy a canvas
Paint it red (aah ah)
Meet the monster
Living under your bed
Maybe he's quite funny once you get to know him, ohh
And you'll wake up
Sometimes it feels like a vision, fantasize
Am I really just the thoughts
That occupy my mind?
Sometimes it feels like I'm waiting
In an endless line
And I won't be tall enough
To get on any of the rides
But I'm so sick of all these changes
I wish that I could stop the clocks and rewind
But somehow life just rearranges
All the plans I had in mind
So buy a canvas
Paint it red (aah ah)
Meet the monster
Living under your bed
Maybe he's quite funny once you get to know him, ohh
And you'll wake
Did you make it home fine?
Did you have a good time?
Did you turn out the lights?
Did you wake?
So buy a canvas
Paint it red (aah ah)
Meet the monster
Buy a canvas
Paint it red (aah ah)
(Did you make it home fine)
Meet the monster
Living under your bed
(Did you have a good time?)
Maybe he's quite funny once you get to know him
(So sick of all these changes)
And you'll wake (wake up, wake up)
