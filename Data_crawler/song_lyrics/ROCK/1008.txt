Song Name: Psycho Circus
Yeah!
Hello!
Here I am, here we are, we are one
I've been waiting for this night to come
Get up!
Now it's time for me to take my place
The make-up runnin' down my face
We're exiled from the human race
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
And I say welcome to the show
I've been waiting here to be your guide
So come
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside
Step up!
No one leaves until the night is done
The amplifiers start to hum
The carnival has just begun
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
And I say welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
The show
I, I've been waiting here to be your guide
So come
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside
Step up
No one leaves until the night is done
The amplifiers start to hum
The carnival has just begun
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
And I say welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
And I say welcome to the show
