Song Name: Charlie
You save you no matter what the cost
How's it cutting out all your friends Handy with that pocket knife
Go blow of steam drinking in parking lots
Then do downers by the pool and leave pedals dripping to your bed
To your bed
Just try to get some sleep Charlie
Got to stop sinking through
Got to start getting back to you
Just go for a walk Charlie
Got to stop sinking through
Got to start getting back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Had a dream last night that a tsunami swallowed us
Feels like that is what I did to you
I know I'm no good for you
We were climbing walls of an old garden supply shop
Guess I'll cool off with some Leonard Cohen Suzanne has a way of knowing
Just try to get some sleep Charlie
Got to stop sinking through
Got to start getting back to you
Just go for a walk Charlie
Got to stop sinking through
Got to start getting back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Got to start getting back to you
Just try to walk it off Charlie
Just try to get some sleep Charlie
Just go for a walk Charlie
Just try to get some sleep Charlie
Got to start getting back to you
Got to start getting back to you
Got to start getting back to you back to you
Just try to walk it off Charlie
Just try to get some sleep Charlie
