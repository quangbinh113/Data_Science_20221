Song Name: Still Sinking
I don't walk alone for the silence
I don't walk alone, 'cause I can't keep pace
It's more like I got one leg shorter
And circles are all that I make (all that I make)
I don't break down for the healing
I don't break ground if I've nothing to hide
But I need some control
'Cause digging this hole is taking all of my time (all of my time)
When I feel the pain
I just slip away, into my
Sweet salvation, won't you take me once again?
I don't want to feel it all
I don't want to know what I've been thinking
Sweet salvation, won't you lead me to the edge?
I just want to take the fall
Seems I've run aground, but I'm still sinking
I don't fight alone because I'm fearless
I don't fight alone 'cause I'm filled with pride
Sometimes the shade gets so thick that the hands, they can't reach you inside
I don't stand down for the kneeling
And I don't break ground if I've nothing to hide
'Cause I need some control
'Cause digging this hole, is taking all of my time
When I feel the pain
I just slip away, into my
Sweet salvation, won't you take me once again?
I don't want to feel it all
I don't want to know what I've been thinking
Sweet salvation, won't you lead me to the edge?
I just want to take the fall
Seems I've run aground, but I'm still sinking
Sweet salvation, won't you take me once again?
I don't want to feel it all
I don't want to know what I've been thinking
Don't want to know what I've been thinking
Sweet salvation, won't you take me once again?
I don't want to feel it all
I don't want to know what I've been thinking
Sweet salvation, won't you lead me to the edge?
I just want to take the fall
Seems I've run aground, but I'm still sinking
I'm still sinking
I'm still sinking
I'm still sinking
I'm still sinking
