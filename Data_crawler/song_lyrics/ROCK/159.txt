Song Name: 100 Little Deaths
Water water cold and deep
Hold me fast that I may sleep
Death with you is hardly more
Than the little deaths before
I've been writing out a list of demands
I got my hands drawing lines in the sand
I felt my power lifting me off the earth
When I didn't have a ghost of a chance
Cracked my teeth biting down on diamonds
Chasing every glare blinding my eyes
Left the taste of bad blood in my mouth
With one truth, while you live you will die
100 little deaths
100 little deaths
Before you're laid to rest
And breathe your last breath
'Cause in this life
While you live you will die
100 little deaths
100 little deaths
Bless my soul singing my Hail Marys
'Cause no one here gets out alive
I was born between the church and the devil
In the dirt with one hand to the sky
Well you just never know
If there's a gift in the curse
You just never know
If there's a gift in the hurt
You just never know
If there's a gift in the curse
One truth, while you live you will die
100 little deaths
100 little deaths
Before you're laid to rest
And breathe your last breath
'Cause in this life
While you live you will die
100 little deaths
100 little deaths
You just never know (if there's a gift in the curse)
You just never know (if there's a gift in the hurt)
You just never know (if there's a gift in the curse)
One truth, while you live you will die
100 little deaths
100 little deaths (100 little deaths)
100 little deaths (100 little deaths)
Before you're laid to rest (before you're laid to rest)
And breathe your last breath (breathe your last breath)
'Cause in this life (in this life)
While you live you will die (oh, you will die)
100 little deaths
100 little deaths
