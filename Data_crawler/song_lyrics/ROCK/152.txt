Song Name: CHOKE (with grandson & Zero 9:36)
Let me find a piece of my mind
That isn't trying to leave me behind
Maybe you should let me go
Cause I need to know what happy looks like
Maybe six feet underground
Let me get relief in the clouds
Is it drowning
If you hold your own head down?
Just let me drown
Let me drown
Let me dive in, sink in deeper
Push my head, choke me till I drown
Let me
Let me
Just let me drown
Drifting out of trust
Slipping down my throat into my lungs
It's cold, but this is where I'll stay
Then they ask why we can't breathe
Dying inside asking, "Why is it me?"
Begging that someone keeps holding you down and you'll drown
Oh, I can't keep running around
I got a smoke in my lungs, I feel the fire beneath
Give me the reason to fight
And they got to come feel when I'm hiving these streets
I couldn't have seen this coming
It would've been dragging it down on my knees
You bleed me out cause I don't got what you need
Let me dive in, sink in deeper
Push my head, choke me till I drown
Let me
Drown
Let me
Just let me drown
