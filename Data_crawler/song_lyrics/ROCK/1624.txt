Song Name: (White Man) in Hammersmith Palais
One, two
One, two, three, four
Midnight to six man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and leroy smart
Delroy wilson, your cool operator
Ken boothe for UK pop reggae
With backing bands sound systems
If they've got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen
But it was four tops all night with encores from stage righten (wooh, ooh, ooh)
Charging from the bass knives to the treble (wooh, ooh, ooh)
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel (wooh, ooh, ooh)
Onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack
'Cos it won't get you anywhere
Fooling with the gun
The british army is waiting out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons
White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up robin hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution
Punk rockers in the UK
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fighting
For a good place under the lighting
The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got burton suits, huh, you think it's funny
Turning rebellion into money
All over people changing their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway
I'm the all night drug-prowling wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
I'm the white man in the palais
Just loo- lookin' for fun
Only lookin' for fun
Oh, please mister
Just leave me alone
I'm only
Lookin' for fun
Lookin' for fun
F, U, N
