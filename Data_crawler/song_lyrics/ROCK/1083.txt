Song Name: Can't Stop Lovin' You (with Carrie Underwood)
I fell from holy Moses mountain,
Where love's a slippery slope
And all the others I've been hanging with,
Never gave me too much room
Then one day she came to me,
Love at first sight, head to toes
I love her wild, my mountain child
And that's just how she goes
And here she got
Hey, I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this,
Tell me what you put into that kiss,
Now keep that coming on,
Let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do,
Cause I can't stop loving you
Got me a good old time and cowboy
He got my picture on the fridge
And the first time when he kissed me,
We was high up on the ridge
And when we came down from the mountain,
I will ride with my mckean
And for all it costs, for getting lost,
There ain't no better sin,
Here we go again
You know I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this,
Tell me what you put into that kiss,
Now keep that coming on,
Let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do,
Cause I can't stop loving you
When I wake up and see your face
All that jump in a picture lace

And that there's nowhere else I would rather be
Then all tied up in this rhapsody in blue
Hey, I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this,
Tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah
Now keep that coming on,
Let my hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do,
Cause I can't stop loving you
