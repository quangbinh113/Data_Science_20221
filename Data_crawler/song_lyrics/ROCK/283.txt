Song Name: Arrow of Love
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone, everyone
Oh, I'm late again, my people need me badly
Look at Herbert here, he's fighting with his homie
I'm fed up with your anger and hate
You always fight, punch, bite through the whole fucking day
I give you love
Shoot it right into your face, my love
Love is everything that you need, love
Is missing in this loveless place
I share my heart with everyone
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone, everyone
Hey, you can't escape, my love is gonna get you
And don't be afraid 'cause I don't wanna hurt you
I'm the god of love, got the power to heal
You from all the sadness and the bad things you feel
I give you love
Shoot it right into your face, my love
Love is everything that you need, love
Is missing in this loveless place
I share my heart with everyone
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone, everyone

We never stop to believe in magic
We're diving into the light
We never stop to believe in magic
We will be forever young, ever young
We never stop to believe in magic
We're diving into the light
We never stop to believe in magic
We will be forever young, ever young
We never stop to believe in magic
We're diving into the light
We never stop to believe in magic
We will be forever young, ever young
I am the one you need
I am sent from above
To fill your empty heart with an arrow of love
I cannot leave
Before you give me all your taste
Your feels, your love
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone
I wanna share my heart with everyone around
I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone, everyone
