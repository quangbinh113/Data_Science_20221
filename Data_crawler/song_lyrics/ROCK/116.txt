Song Name: Godspeed
Godspeed
Manipulated, got a way with lies that stole my trust
So you could throw me in the fire that you built for us
You paralyzed the best in me
So all I'd feel is misery
You tried to bend me 'til I break
Bend me 'til I break, break down
Put me in the grave
Put me in the grave, facedown
Lyin' if I said "Wish you well ahead, I'm done now"
Yeah, here's to you and me
So long, godspeed
(Godspeed)
You're hanging on to pieces shattered like shards of glass
Pull 'em closer 'cause you know you'll never get them back
If I never see your face again, that's too soon
This is overdue
You tried to bend me 'til I break
Bend me 'til I break, break down
Put me in the grave
Put me in the grave, facedown
Lyin' if I said "Wish you well ahead, I'm done now"
Yeah, here's to you and me
You paralyzed the best in me
So all I'd feel is misery
You paralyzed the best in me
But I survived
And now you're dead to me
And now you're dead to me
So long, so long
You tried to bend me 'til I break
Bend me 'til I break, break down
Put me in the grave
Put me in the grave, facedown
Lyin' if I said "Wish you well ahead, I'm done now"
Yeah, here's to you and me
You tried to bend me 'til I break
Bend me 'til I break, break down
Put me in the grave
Put me in the grave, facedown
Lyin' if I said "Wish you well ahead, I'm done now"
Yeah, here's to you and me
Enjoy the misery, godspeed
(Godspeed)
Godspeed
