Song Name: Hard Luck Woman
If never I met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for our first Hello
We'd never have to say goodbye
If never I held you
My feelin's would never show
It's time I start walkin'
But there's so much you'll never know
I keep telling you Hard Luck Woman
You ain't a Hard Luck Woman
Rags, the sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a Hard Luck Woman
Baby, till you find your man
Before I go let me Kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you, girl
You know I could never lie
I keep telling you Hard Luck Woman
You ain't a Hard Luck Woman
You'll be a Hard Luck Woman
Baby, till you find your man

Rags, the sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a Hard Luck Woman
Baby, till you find your man
You'll be a Hard Luck Woman
Baby, till you find your man
Oh yeah, bye bye, so long, don't cry
I'm just packin' my bags, whoo, leavin' you
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, baby, don't cry
I gotta keep on movin', yeah movin'
Bye, bye my baby
Ooh, don't cry, lady, oh
