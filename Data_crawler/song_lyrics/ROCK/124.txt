Song Name: Nobody Wants to Die
The priest took off his collar
Started wearing it like a headband
He said
X's and O's, fingers and toes
Now you want to kiss a dead man
Do you want to kiss a dead man
Sun coming over the mountain
Nobody's telling the truth
That fire you started down in Chaparral
Burned everybody that you knew
It burned everybody that you knew
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
X's and O's, ribbons and bows
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
Silver and gold, people you know
Ain't no one gonna save you
But whatever you do
Whatever you do
It's coming after you
It burned north through the county
Like a fire's been known to do
It's been on your trail
Now it's on your tail
And it's surrounding you
It's surrounding you
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
X's and O's, ribbons and bows
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
Silver and gold, people you know
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
But whatever you do
Whatever you do
It's coming after you
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
X's and O's, ribbons and bows
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
Nobody wants to die
But they know
They're gonna have to
Silver and gold, people you know
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
But whatever you do
Whatever you do
It's coming after you
It's coming after you
They're coming after you
They're coming after you
