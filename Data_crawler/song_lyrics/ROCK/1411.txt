Song Name: Peace Frog
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles (she came)
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee (she came)
Blood in the streets, the town of Chicago (she came)
Blood on the rise, it's following me
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Blood in the streets turn a river of sadness (she came)
Blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh (she came)
Yeah, the river runs red down the legs of a city (she came)
The women are cryin' and rivers are weepin' (she came)
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleedin'
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Fantastic L.A.
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be borne in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets, the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me
