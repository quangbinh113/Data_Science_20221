Song Name: I EXIST
Stand up, you've gotta fight
It's a temporary feeling, not like suicide
It's like a war in your mind
But you're stronger than you think now
You'll be alright
(Better days will come to light)
(Better days will come to light)
(Better days will come to light)
I see the morning light and wonder why I'm still here
If I exist another day would anybody even fucking care?
Stand up, you've gotta fight
It's a temporary feeling, not like suicide
(Better days will come to light)
I know it's tough, but it's not enough
To give up and
(Better days will come to light)
You gotta stay, you'll be glad one day
And you'll know that
(Better days will come to light)
I lie awake at night
Feel like I'm gonna die
I wanna fly away and wake up on the other side
You're stronger this way
You're sad, it's ok
And you know that
I know I'm lost but want to find myself while I'm alive
And I put a light up to my shoulder just to ask if I can smile
They say that happiness would find me but the monster found me first
Drown it out with your soul fire
Let the bastard die of thirst
(Better days will come to light)
I know it's tough, but it's not enough
To give up and
(Better days will come to light)
You gotta stay, you'll be glad one day
And you'll know that
(Better days will come to light)
I lie awake at night
Feel like I'm gonna die
I wanna fly away and wake up on the other side
You're stronger this way
You're sad, it's ok
And you know that
I am NULA
And I am free
I am NULA
And I am free
I am NULA
And I am free
I am NULA
And I am free
I'VE FOUND YOU MOTHER FUCKER
(Better days will come to light)
I know it's tough, but it's not enough
To give up and
(Better days will come to light)
You gotta stay, you'll be glad one day
And you'll know that
(Better days will come to light)
I lie awake at night
Feel like I'm gonna die
I wanna fly away and wake up on the other side
You're stronger this way
You're sad, it's ok
And you know that
