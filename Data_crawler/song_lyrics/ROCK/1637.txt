Song Name: This is Radio Clash
Interrupting all programmes
This is radio clash from pirate satellite
Orbiting your living room, cashing in the bill of rights
Cuban army surplus or refusing all third lights
This is radio clash on pirate satellite
This sound does not subscribe to the international plan
In the psycho shadow of the white right hand
Then that see ghettology as an urban Vietnam
Giving deadly exhibitions of murder by napalm
This is radio clash tearing up the seven veils
This is radio clash please save us, not the whales
This is radio clash underneath a mushroom cloud
This is radio clash, you don't need that funeral shroud (Why play?)
Forces have been looting, my humanity
Curfews have been curbing the end of liberty
Hands of law have sorted through my identity
But now this sound is brave and wants to be free, anyway to be free
This is radio clash on pirate satellite
This is not free Europe
Nor an armed force network
This is radio clash using audio ammunition
This is radio clash can we get that world to listen
This is radio clash using aural ammunition
This is radio clash can we get that world to listen?
This is radio clash on pirate satellite
(This is radio clash) Orbiting your living room cashing in the bill of rights
This is radio clash on pirate satellite
This is radio clash everybody hold on tight
(This is radio clash) A-riggy diggy dig dang, dang
(This is radio clash) Go back to urban 'Nam
