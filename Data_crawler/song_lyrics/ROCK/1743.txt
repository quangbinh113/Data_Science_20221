Song Name: Whole Lotta Rosie
Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh, she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
She ain't exactly small
42-39-56
You could say she's got it all!
Never had a woman, never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin-and-bones
But you give all you got, weighin' in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman
Honey, you can do, do it to me all night long
Only one can turn, only one can turn me on
All through the night-time
Right around the clock
To my suprise, Rosie never stops
She was a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
