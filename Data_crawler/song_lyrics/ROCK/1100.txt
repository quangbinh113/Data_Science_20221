Song Name: Follow Your Heart
Have you ever climbed the mountain?
Have you ever crossed the sea?
Take a look around the corner
And listen to your heartbeat
Have you ever touched the rainbow
Take a ride on the ferris wheel.
It takes one step to start a journey.
It's up to you, to make it real
This is the time for yourself to be free
You gonna follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart
Walking far away horizons
You will never walk alone
You'll be at home when your heart is
A million miles away from home
This is the time for yourself to be free
You gonna follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart
Show me the way who knows the way
This is the only road to go.
Life brings me down, it takes me up
It only, only heaven knows
This is the time for yourself to be free
You gonna follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart
You gotta follow your heart
