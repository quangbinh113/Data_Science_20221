Song Name: We Are One
You are not alone and how long can you run?
It's much to late if you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Once upon a time you were a child but that was yesterday
Believed that magic in your heart would never fade away
But hold your head up high and let your spirits fly
Keep hope alive, yes deep inside and your dreams will never die
We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one
Ohh, take a breath, close your eyes, you're on the road again
And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Something's never change but if you fantasize
You'll feel it deep inside yourself and then you'll realize
When you feel it coming, when you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you wanna cry
And that you'll know it deep inside
We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one
You are me, I am you
What you see is all true
It's all true
You are me, I am you
What you see is all true
It's all true
You are me, I am you (We are one)
What you see is all true (We are one)
It's all true
You are me, I am you (We are one)
What you see is all true (We are one)
We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see (We are one)
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
