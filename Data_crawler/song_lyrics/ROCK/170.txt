Song Name: The Optimist
I lost my head
In all the confusion
Have I become
So numb to everything
Want to stop the world
And just kill the conversation
Try to walk the line
To find some peace of mind
I'm searching for a silver lining
But I feel like a dying breed
Running out of lies to believe
If life is a dream we need
When it comes to pointing the blame
Everyone's got something to say
Screaming for change but staying the same
Expecting the cycle to break
(Break)
I don't want your cure
I don't need your savior
To give me a sign of life underneath
I just need to know
How to heal the hollow
To keep the optimist alive in me
I'm falling from pride
Tripping over the fault lines
Knowing all this time
That silence doesn't make a sound
When it comes to pointing the blame
Everyone's got something to say
Screaming for change but staying the same
Expecting the cycle to break
(Break)
I don't want your cure
I don't need your savior
To give me a sign of life underneath
I just need to know
How to heal the hollow
To keep the optimist alive in me
I don't want your cure
I don't need your savior
To give me a sign of life underneath
I just need to know
How to heal the hollow
To keep the optimist alive in me
Is there a cure
Is there a savior
Is there a sign of life underneath
I need to know
How to heal this hollow
To keep the optimist alive in me
