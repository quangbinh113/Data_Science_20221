Song Name: Here to Forever
In every movie I watch from the '50s
There's only one thought that swirls
Around my head now
And that's that everyone there on the screen
Yeah, everyone there on the screen
Well, they're all dead now
They're all dead now
And it ain't easy living above
And I can't help but keep falling in love
With bones and ashes
With bones and ashes
And when the color is too bold and bright
I'm daydreaming in black and white
Until it passes
Until it passes
I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever

Oh, these days it's so hard to relax
You gotta hold a gun to my back
To make me smile
To make me smile
And the only way I seem to cope
Is by trying to hold onto hope
If just for a while
If just for a while
I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Now it seems more than ever
There's no hands on the levers
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Only rollers keep rolling
While the searchers keep scrolling
I wanna know the measure
From here to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Now it seems more than ever
There's no hands on the levers
And I wanna feel the pressure
Of God or whatever
Or whatever
