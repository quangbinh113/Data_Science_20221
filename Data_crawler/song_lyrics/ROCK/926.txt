Song Name: Hysteria
Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shakin' to my knees

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feelin'
Can't stop this fire
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh, can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near'
Out of me, into you, yeah
You can't hide, it's just a one-way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide, that's right
Dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me
I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh, can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near'
C'mon
I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh, can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, ooh babe (oh, can you feel it?)
Ooh, babe (do you believe it?)
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
(When you get that feelin') You better believe it
Better start believin' (better start believin')
God, it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, ooh babe

Say you will
Get closer to me
Close to me, baby (oh)
Baby
Closer (closer)
Get closer
Closer to me
