Song Name: How You Leapt
I've still got the letter you wrote in May
A couple of t shirts and that picture from the tour in Germany
Streams of tears in your bathroom
Oh I can't take you where you need to go
But we could sort through your problems
You know we both hate being on our own
Seems like only yesterday
That you were sneaking in
Crawling up my carpeted stairs
Wine on your breath
Into my bed you leapt
I welcome you with open arms
Now I just hope you know that you're dead wrong
I'm not feeling any better
I heard that you are
Streams of tears in your bathroom
Oh I can't take you where you need to go
One in ten cars are red
And every red car is you
You seem to be there in the strangest of places
It's unusual
Welcome you with open arms
Now I just hope you know that you're dead wrong
I'm not feeling any better
I heard that you are
Could've happened on the landing
Could've happened on the stairs
Could've happened absolutely anywhere
Could've happened at my dad's house
Could've happened in your car
Could've happened absolutely anywhere
Could've happened on the landing
Could've happened on the stairs
Could've happened absolutely anywhere
Could've happened at my dad's house
Could've happened in your car
Could've happened absolutely anywhere
I welcome you with open arms
Now I just hope you know that you're dead wrong
I'm not feeling any better
I heard that you are
