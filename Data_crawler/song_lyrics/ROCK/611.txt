Song Name: I Put A Spell On You
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the thing that you doin'
I said "Watch out!", I ain't lyin'
Yeah
I ain't gonna take none of your
Foolin' around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Puttin' me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Oh, alright!
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the thing that you doin'
I said "Watch out!", I ain't lyin'
Yeah
I ain't gonna take none of your
Foolin' around
Ain't gonna take none of your
Puttin' me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Tune the sound
