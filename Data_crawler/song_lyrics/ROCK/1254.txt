Song Name: I Was Born To Love You - 2011 Remaster
I was born to love you

With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day
Alright, hey, hey
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love (hey)
So, take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream and my dreams come true
It's so hard to believe, this is happening to me
An amazing feeling coming through
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life
I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Born to love you
Born to love you
Yes, I was born to love you
Born to love you
Born to love you
Every single day of my life
An amazing feeling coming through
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
Yes, I was born to love you
Every single day of my life
Woo! I love you, babe
Yeah, born to love you
Yes I was born to love you, hey
I wanna love you, love you, love you
I wanna love you, hey, yeah
It's magic

I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, loney yeah!
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Yeah give it to me
