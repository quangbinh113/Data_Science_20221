Song Name: Creatures Of The Night
Searching in the darkness
Running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow
Nothing left to say
Victims of the moment
Future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper
'Til we start to shout
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
Breathing in the madness
Spitting out the lies
Searching for an answer
Keep your alibis
Don't know where we're goin'
Just know where we've been
Remember when the clock strikes twelve
The losers always win
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
Ha!
Searching in the darkness
Running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow
Nothing left to say
Gathering up our courage
Ready for the fight
Howling in the shadows
'Til we start to bite
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
