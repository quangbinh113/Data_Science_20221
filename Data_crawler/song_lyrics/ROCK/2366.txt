Song Name: Out Of Control - Remastered 2008
Monday morning
Eighteen years of dawning
I said how long?
You say how long?
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad (so sad)
They were so glad
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
(Out of control)
(Out of control)
(Out)
(Out of control)
(Out of control)
(Out of control)
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
