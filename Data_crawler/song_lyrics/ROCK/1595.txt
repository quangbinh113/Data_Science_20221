Song Name: She Talks to Rainbows
She's a little lost girl in her own little world
She looks so happy but she seems so sad, oh yeah
She's a little lost girl in her own little world
I'd like to help her, I'd like to try, oh yeah
She talks to birds
She talks to angels
She talks to trees
She talks to bees
She don't talk to me
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas
She talks to trees
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
You know she drives me outta my mind
You know she drives me outta my head
You know she drives me outta my mind
You know she drives me outta my head
She talks to birds
She talks to angels
She talks to trees
She talks to bees
She don't talk to me
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas
She talks to trees
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
She's a little lost girl in her own little world
She looks so happy but she seems so sad, oh yeah
She's a little lost girl in her own little world
I'd like to help her, I'd like to try, oh yeah
She talks to birds
She talks to angels
She talks to trees
She talks to bees
She don't talk to me
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas
She talks to trees
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
She don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
