Song Name: Magic
Head over heels in love with you
All my feelings explode
You break my limits â€“ you change my rules
There's no more control
Every time you smile at me
My heart goes boom
You take me so high
Feels like I could almost touch the moon
When I look at you
I can see magic
All the stars in the sky
Light up in your eyes
When you touch my hand
I can feel magic
There's a crazy chemistry
Between you and me
With you here in my world
Everything is so right
Let me hold you, let me show you
That what we have is paradise
We've got our whole lives to live
And we let love shine
You're my best friend, you're my lover
My once in a lifetime
When I look at you
I can see magic
All the stars in the sky
Light up in your eyes
When you touch my hand
I can feel magic
There's a crazy chemistry
Between you and me
I can see magic!
When I look at you
I can see magic
All the stars in the sky
Light up in your eyes
When I look at you
I can see magic
All the stars in the sky
Light up in your eyes
When you touch my hand
I can feel magic
There's a crazy chemistry
Between you and me
