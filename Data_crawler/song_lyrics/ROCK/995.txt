Song Name: I Love It Loud
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no I never could be tamed
Better believe it
Guilty 'till I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I wanna be president
Cause I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two fisted 'till the very end
No more treated like aliens
We're not gonna take it
No lies, no more alibis
Turn it up, got me hypnotized
Rock on, won't be tranquilized
Cause I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Turn it up
Headline, jungle is the only rule
Front page roar of the nation's cool
Turn it up, this is my attitude
Take it or leave it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
(I love it) Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah, oh yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah, heyhey
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
