Song Name: White Riot - Remastered
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
Black man gotta lot a problems
But they don't mind throwing a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be thick
And everybody's doing
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
All the power's in the hands
Of people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it
And everybody's doing
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
