Song Name: Die Another Day
Lay my tentacles in the crucible
Just to see the world
As something beautiful again
Melt my sins
He's losing pounds, just lay him down
And pop it in its place
Take the scruff and pull it up
He'll die another day!
Start over, I can't bear to look back
Start over, I always run away
Sweet closure, cure me of my candor
Shoo, vultures, I'll die another day
Lay my tentacles in the crucible
Just to see my chores
As something meaningful again
From within
All out of breath from my warpath
Sweating toxicity, begging for amnesty
Make it a song, always a song
Can only tell you the truth in the chant of a tone
I'll never be enough unless I finish this sentence
Did it come into existence, or was it invented?
Only getting stuck because I already did it!
Start over, I can't bear to look back
Start over, I always run away
Sweet closure, cure me of my candor
Shoo, vultures, I'll die another day
Pigeon in my vision, frigid in the kitchen
Blithering, committed, piebald cow
Scummy ballerina standing on your femur
Pop your sloppy doggy eyeballs out
Started at the finish, did it in a minute
Living to flip in the breeze
Had to do the did it, rigid, ribbit critic
Making a pino go grig
God, why'd you have to do that to me?
Safe, sound on the other side
Back to devour what I've been denied
Bad track record to be kind, but this time I'll be paying attention
Can't dwell on my damaged pride
I got moves to make, I got hearts to break through
Manic and erratic, but emphatic about learning the hard way (learning the hard way)
Need to bite the animal
To get my instincts churning
Shake up my camera roll
Been a minute, it's been a minute
We don't obey
It's all a game
There's no give and take, there's no give and take
There's no talk but kill the king
No talk, just kill the king
They won't talk, just kill the...
I'm shaking the plastic off, ripping the wrapper off
Students coming out clean
Devoted to master stroke, licking the envelope
Sending my bright blue flame
