Song Name: Ball and Chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
That pretty piece of Cuba
Designed to cause men pain
Oh, when you light up in Cuba
You won't feel the same again
Down in Guantanamo
Moves you, waitin' for the big cigars
Down in Guantanamo
Mmm, still waitin' for the big cigars
Been a breach of promise
Hmm, still guilty with no charge
There's a-smoke in the forest
Hmm, and the tumour is gettin' large
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Ooh, there's a long road to travel

For justice to make its claim
So let's bring down the gavel
Let the prisoner say his name
Hmm, still waitin' for the big cigars
Still waitin' for
Still waiting for the big cigars
Hey, still waitin' for the big cigars
