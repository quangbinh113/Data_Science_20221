Song Name: My Ding-A-Ling
When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hanging on a string
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling, oh
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
When mama took me to Sunday school
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
I would sit there playin' with my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
When pa started me to grammar school
I found a place in the best of youth
And every time the bell would ring
They would catch me playin' with my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard, I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
She would be the queen, I would be the king
Together we played with my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
This here song it ain't so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
Oh, come on, now everybody sing now
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want to play with my ding-a-ling once more
