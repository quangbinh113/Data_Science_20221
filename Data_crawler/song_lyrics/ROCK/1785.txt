Song Name: Peaceful Easy Feeling - 2013 Remaster
I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin, it's so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I gotta peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing
On the ground
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Ah, but she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go
And I gotta peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing
On the ground
I get this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering
In my other ear, tells me
I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing
I'm already standing
Yes, I'm already standing
On the ground
