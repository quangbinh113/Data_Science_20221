Song Name: Rotoscope
Shadows bloom in the skyline
Surface tension keeps dust in my eyes
I can't take back the skeletons that haunt me frame by frame
I can rapture the imprints sent to bore into my brain
And I know that I feel the end is imminent
How long have I felt this way?
Sign of the times
Shadows sway to light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change from violent delights
Shadows sway, light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change
Shallow, this is what I created
Splayed out skeletons in the cracks in the pavement
And now, can you feel the injection back behind those cloudy eyes?
In-between every cataract, a projection of my life
How long have I felt this way?
Sign of the times
Shadows sway to light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change from violent delights
Shadows sway, light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change
In slow motion
The end is imminent, it's imminent
Without your devotion
I need that skyline
Without your horizon
The end is imminent, it's imminent...
Fade, sign of the times
Shadows sway, light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change
Sign of the times
Shadows sway to light up my life
Trace the answers, tears have never made me change
Trace the answers, tears have never made me cha-cha-cha-change
