Song Name: Helicopter
North to South, empty
Running on, bravado
As if to say, as if to say
As if to say, he doesn't like chocolate

I'm thinking six
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough, it's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough, it's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough, it's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough, it's not enough)
