Song Name: King Of The Dogs
I got a smelly rear, I got a dirty nose
I don't want no shoes, I don't want no clothes
I'm living like the king of the dogs
I got a piece of meat in between my teeth
I will bite your throat if you move on me
I am sovereign 'cause I'm the king of the dogs
Polite life will fill you full of cancer
I don't even own a pair of pants
I'm a dancer, baby
I'm deadly 'cause I'm the king of the dogs
I'm hanging out where the spirits dwell
I can smell the things that you cannot smell
I'm deadly, I'm the king of the dogs
