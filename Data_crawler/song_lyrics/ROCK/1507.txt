Song Name: Cut My Hair
Why should I care if I have to cut my hair?
I got to move with the fashion or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man is really alright
And I'm still living at home even though it won't last
Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right
For a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
The kids at school have parents
That seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt 'em
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my Momma found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay
Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right
For a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
Why do I have to be different to them?
Just to earn the respect of a dancehall friend
We have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd of kids
That hardly notice I'm around?
I work myself to death just to fit in
I'm comin' down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work and he wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick first thing in the morning
Closed after a gang of nearly a thousand youths
Entered the Grand Hotel in pursuit of two leather-clad rockers
South Coast police have warned that if the fights
Between rival gangs of mods and rockers continue
Stricter security measures will be enforced at railway stations
Both in London and on the South Coast
