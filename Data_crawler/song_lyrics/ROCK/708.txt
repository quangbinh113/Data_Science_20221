Song Name: Walk Of Life - Remastered 1996
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-bop-a-lula, baby what I say
Here come Johnny singin' "I got a woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turnin' all the nighttime into the day
The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Here come Johnny, gonna tell you a story
Hand me now my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turnin' all the nighttime into the day
The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-bop-a-lula, baby what I say
Here come Johnny singing "I got a woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turnin' all the nighttime into the day
And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Hmm, you do the walk of life
A-woohoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, do the walk of life
