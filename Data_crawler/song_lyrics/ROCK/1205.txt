Song Name: Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)
The police in New York City
They chased a boy right through the park
In a case of mistaken identity
They put a bullet through his heart
Heartbreakers with your forty-four
I wanna tear your world apart
You are a heartbreaker with your forty-four
I wanna tear your world apart
A ten year old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said, "She had no chance, no chance"
Heartbreaker, a heartbreaker
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heartbreaker, a pain maker
Stole the love right out your heart
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You stole the love right out my heart
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
I wanna tear your world, wanna tear that world
I, I, I wanna tear that world apart
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You stole the love right
You stole the love right
