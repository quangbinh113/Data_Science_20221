Song Name: All Along the Watchtower
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief"
Businessmen, they, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth, hey, hey
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke, but, uh
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely, now
The hour's getting late" Hey
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princess kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, but, uh
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey
All along the watchtower
Gotta beware, gotta beware, I will
All along the watchtower
