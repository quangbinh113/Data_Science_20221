Song Name: Go Go Go
Down goes the sun, sitting, ducking on guitar
Up comes the moon, twinkle, twinkle little star
One and one is two HITCHIN' two, to make it four
Johnny get your guitar, let's go, go, go, oh baby
Johnny plays the guitar at the weekly record hop
He starts to twist and turn and then they wouldn't let him stop
Girls so shook up, seein' him shakin' on the show
Everybody starts to holler go, go, go, oh baby
Duckwalkin' on his knees, peckin' like a hen
Lookin' like a locomotive, here he comes again
Meow said the kitty PUPPY bow-wow-wow
Go and pick your guitar, Johnny don't stop now, oh baby
Backed up by a jazz band, layin' on the wood
Mixin' Ahmad Jamal in my Johnny B. Goode
Sneaking Errol Garner in my Sweet Sixteen
Now they tell me Stan Kenton's cutting Maybelline, oh baby
Papa said to Mama, this I never understood
How he picks his guitar, make it sound so good
Used to sound goofy, but I guess it's alright
Papa's takin' Mama to the gig tomorrow night, oh baby
