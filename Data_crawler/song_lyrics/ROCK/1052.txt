Song Name: Livin' On The Edge
There's somethin' wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
There's somethin' wrong with the world today
The light bulb's gettin' dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man that I
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
You can't stop yourself from falling (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge (everybody, everybody)
Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawlin'
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
Even if it was, would you still come crawlin'
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I would rather be a hanging on
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin' (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
You can't stop yourself from fallin' (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge (everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got to that now
