Song Name: Rest In Peace
Blood on my hands, what's done is done
Left you by the road with the crows and the dust
Heart so hollow, deep as a cave
One day I'll be dancing on your grave
Taking it back the life you stole
Every little piece you took of my soul
Now I lay you down to sleep
And I pray with the devil you rest in peace
You can't hang your chains on me
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain't yours to bleed
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I'm over you, yeah
I buried you
Oh Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace
Black umbrella in the pouring rain
No preacher, no prayer to cry your name
A little too late to right your wrongs
No one's laying roses on your bones
No tears or loving memories
Long is the road outta hell into misery
So by my decree
You can't hang your chains on me
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain't yours to bleed
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I'm over you, yeah
I buried you
Oh Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace, oh yeah
You can't hurt me now
Can't hold me down
What's done is done
You can't hurt me now
Can't hold me down
I've had enough
Oh Lord, you're dead to me
So I lay you down, lay you down to sleep
You can't hang your chains on me
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain't yours to bleed
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I'm over you, yeah
I buried you
Oh Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Rest in peace, oh
Rest in peace
