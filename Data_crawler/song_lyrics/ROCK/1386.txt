Song Name: If 6 Was 9
Yeah, sing a song for us
If the sun refused to shine
I don't mind, I don't mind (yeah)
If the mountains fell in the sea
Let it be, it ain't me (well alright)
I got my own world to look through, and ah
And I ain't gonna copy you
Yeah (it's alright)
Now, if a six turned out to be nine
I don't mind, oh, I don't mind (well alright)
If all the hippies cut off all their hair
I don't care, I don't care
Dig, 'cause I got my own world to live through, and ah
And I ain't gonna copy you
White-collar conservative flashing down the streets
Pointing their plastic finger at me
They're hoping soon my kind'll drop and die
But I'm, I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high, wow!
Wave on, wave on
Fall mountains, just don't fall on me
Go 'head on Mr. Businessman
You can't dress like me, yeah
Don't nobody know what I'm talking about
I've got my own life to live
I'm the one that's gonna have to die
When it's time for me to die
So let me live my life
The way I want to, yeah
Sing on brother
Play on drummer
