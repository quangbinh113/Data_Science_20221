Song Name: Kill Or Be Killed
(Kill or be killed)
Cornered, I'm exhausted with fear
Our love and compassion dissolved
And demons, have materialized in me
Can't fight them, they're taking control
And we've tried, oh we've tried so hard to be good
But the world rewards us when we're bad
Fate, is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed
(Kill or be killed)
They've driven a stake right through my heart
I'm growing so cold and detached
And I've tried, oh I've tried so hard to spread love
But she prefers it when I assert control
Fate has brought us here to face
Our hopes and dreams erased
Either kill or be killed
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah
Ah, eh, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah
Kill or be killed
Waaaar
Kill or be killed
Yaaaah
Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah
Either kill or be killed
Fate, is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
