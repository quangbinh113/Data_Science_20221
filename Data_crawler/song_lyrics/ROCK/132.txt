Song Name: RECOVER
(We would not go backwards)
It starts to really feel like we'll be doing this forever
Well, if we're fucking dying, we'll be dying here together
It's like what's keeping the world alive (keeping the world alive)
It's when the people are terrified (terrified)
So what's the point of life when you put it on a price tag?
They just roll a dice with our lives like a safe bet
So give us all the guns, just for fun, 'til we're all dead
Do it all again
When will we all
Recover?
We're all just waiting for the day
We're not stuck in the same place
We started from
We're under
Pressure like a tidal wave
Crashing down until we break
Hypocrites, sycophants, do it like a dance
Make it so divine, saving lives, that's some gas
When an old, white man couldn't keep it in his pants
He'll flip-flop like a TikTok trend
You ain't gotta stop the world from coming
And the chances that you'll wait are next to nothing
Stand in solidarity-darity
As their bodies turn to policy, policy
When will we all
Recover?
We're all just waiting for the day
We're not stuck in the same place
We started from
We're under
Pressure like a tidal wave
Crashing down until we break
It won't be like it was
It's hell for all of us
'Cause when enough is enough
We'll all be spilling blood
(March)
(No justice, no fucking peace)
When will we all
Recover?
We're all just waiting to be saved
But nothing's ever gonna change
When will we all
Recover?
We're all just waiting for the day
When no one has to die in vain
Anymore
We're under (under)
Pressure like a tidal wave
Crashing down until we break
(Come on, uh, uh)
