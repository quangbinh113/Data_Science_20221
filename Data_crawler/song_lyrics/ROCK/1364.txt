Song Name: Dancing Days - Remaster
Dancing days are here again,
As the summer evenings grow.
I got my flower, I got my power,
I got a woman who knows.
I said it's alright,
You know it's alright,
I guess it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?
Crazy ways are evident,
By the way you wearin' your clothes.
Sippin' booze is precedent,
As the evening starts to glow.
You know it's alright,
I said it's alright,
You know it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?
Do Ya?
You told your mother I'd get you home,
But you didn't say that I got no car.
I saw a lion, he was standin' alone,
With a tadpole in a jar.
You know it's alright,
I said it's alright,
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?
So dancing days are here again,
As the summer evenings grow.
You are my flower, you are my power,
You are my woman who knows.
I said it's alright,
You know it's alright,
You know it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it isn't.
