Song Name: Miss You - Remastered
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been staring in my dreams
Lord I miss you, child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around you know, like we used to
Oh everybody wait so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come on, come on!
I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people to, to, to
What's the matter with you boy?
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say
I won't miss you child
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you child
You just been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't kiss you like that, yeah
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
