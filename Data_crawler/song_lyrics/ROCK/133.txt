Song Name: Taunt Me
Pick me up just to knock me down
I can see you like it
You're trying, trying to let me drown
But I will stand up fighting
'Cause I always get back up
And I'm never giving up
Even though it's all too much
But you'll always see me get back up
I used to sleep without a single stir
Not even sure what that feels like anymore, anymore
Your presence is so haunting
Forever still you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
Shattered my soul
Never felt so alone
There is no way of getting out, no
You keep dragging me down
But I always get back up
And I'm never giving up
Even though it's all too much
But you'll always see me get back up
I used to sleep without a single stir
Not even sure what that feels like anymore, anymore
Your presence is so haunting
Forever still you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
I sit alone and I wonder
I hope you're happy as you're, you're pretending to be
As you're pretending to be
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
I used to sleep without a single stir
Not even sure what that feels like anymore, anymore
Your presence is so haunting
Forever still you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
Yeah, you taunt me
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
I never sleep, I'm not at peace
