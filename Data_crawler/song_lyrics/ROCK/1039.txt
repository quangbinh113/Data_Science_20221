Song Name: Crazy
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall
The way you make good for all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're making up more than we're making love
And it always seems you got something on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
Say you're leaving on a 7:30 train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you been giving me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feeling bad looks good, yeah
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
You're packing up your stuff
And talking like it's tough
And trying to tell me that it's time to go, yeah
But, I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show, yeah
That kinda loving
Makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah
That kinda loving, yeah
Now I'm never, never, never gonna be the same
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
I'm losing my mind, girl
Girl, 'cause I'm going cra
I need your love, honey, yeah
I need your love
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
'Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you baby
You turn it on then, you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, now, baby, baby, baby, baby
