Song Name: God Of Thunder
Ok? Y'all can start singing
Alright, set, I can't hear you
Not that damn loud!
You've got something about you
You've got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed
I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one
God of thunder
And Rock 'N Roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
What? I can't, I don't wanna do it too loud
I'm the Lord of the wastelands
A modern-day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the
God of thunder
And Rock 'N Roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
What? God damnit
And I'm not like that crack addict
I am the Lord of the wastelands
A modern-day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me (Stop, ok man!)
And I command you to kneel
Before the
God of thunder
And Rock 'N Roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
