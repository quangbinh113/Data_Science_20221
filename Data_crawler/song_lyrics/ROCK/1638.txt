Song Name: Hitsville U.K. - Remastered
They cried the tears, they shed the fears
Up and down the land
They stole guitars or used guitars
So the tape would understand.
Without even
The slightest hope
Of a thousand sales
Just as if
As if there was
Hitsville in UK
I Know the boy was all alone
Till the Hitsville hit UK.
Remember
They say true talent
Will always emerge in time
When lightening hits small wonder
It's fast rough factory trade
No expense accounts
Or lunch discounts
Or hypeing up the charts
The band went in
And knocked 'em dead
In two minutes fifty-nine
I know the boy was all alone
Till the Hitsville hit UK
So hit it
No slimy deals
With smarmy eels
In Hitsville UK
Let's shake and say
We'll operate
In Hitsville UK
I know the boy felt all alone
Till the Hitsville hit UK
The mutants, creeps and muscle men
Are shaking like a leaf
It blows a hole in the radio
When it hasn't sounded good all week
A mike 'n' boom
In your living room
In Hitsville UK
No consumer trials
No A.O.R.
In Hitsville UK
I know the boy felt all alone
Till the Hitsville hit UK
Now the boys and girls are not alone
Now the Hitsville hit UK.
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now the Hitsville hit UK.
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now the Hitsville hit UK.
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now the Hitsville hit UK.
