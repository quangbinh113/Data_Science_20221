Song Name: Dude for David
Hey, Mister Starman, who knows where you've been
With your final fate dangling from eyes of blue and green
We passed upon the stairway on a pilgrimage to you
I said "Can I call you David and will you call me Dude?"
You can call me Dude
Mecca TV station broadcast you Channel 2
You strummed your 12 string razor
And I Moonage Daydreamed you
In Medina Costa some flat white caveman said
"He can't be homosapiens. Dude, he's already dead."
Did you just call me Dude?
I'm Tom the Major and no cosmic jive
A rock of ages. I will abide
I'm Tom the Major and no cosmic jive
A rock of ages. I will abide
So when you looked right through me and denied that I was you
A smorgasbord of psychosis made me scream like Siouxsie Sioux
Dude. Why don't you call me Dude
Call me, call me, call me, call me Dude
Not only is this the last show of this tour
It's the last show we'll ever do
So boys and girls, gentlemen, Ladies
Why don't you call me Dude
Call me, call me, call me, call me Dude
