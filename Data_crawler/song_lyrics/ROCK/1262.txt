Song Name: '39 - Remastered 2011
In the year of '39
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out
Into the blue and sunny morn'
The sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavenly weigh
For the earth is old and grey
Little darling went away
But, my love, this cannot be
For so many years have gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life, still ahead, pity me
