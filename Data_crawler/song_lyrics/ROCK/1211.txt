Song Name: Paying The Cost To Be The Boss
You act like you don't wanna listen
When I'm talkin' to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you wanna do
You gotta be crazy, baby
Just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bill
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
I'll drink if I wanna
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm takin' care of you
As long as I'm workin', baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live
You gotta be crazy, baby
Just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bill
I'm paying the cost to be the boss
Now that you've got me
You act like you're a shame
You don't act like my baby
You're just usin' money
But i tell you I'm gonna handle money
And I don't want no back talk
If you don't like what I'm doin' baby
Pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy, baby
Just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bill
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
