Song Name: Long, Long Road
The room is on fire, I can't find the door
You vote for a liar, he just lies some more
There could be life on Mars, but we don't care
And now we're in the thick of it again
Where will we begin when we start again
'Cause it might be a World War III before we depart again
And it's gonna be a long road if we ever see the end
It's gonna be a long, long road
Or is this the end? (Or is this the end?)
We're starting to wake up, we're finding our groove
But some still deny it, they're twisting the truth
The world's on fire, but they don't care
As long as they're keeping the lion's share
Where will we begin when we start again
'Cause it might be a World War III before we depart again
And it's gonna be a long road if we ever see the end
It's gonna be a long, long road
Or is this the end? (Or is this the end?)
If we ever see the end
