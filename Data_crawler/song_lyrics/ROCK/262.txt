Song Name: Emergency Contact
There's no greater vengeance
Than learning to enjoy again
Hope you get the message
Nobody's shatter-resistant (shit)
Therapy is tiring
But so is hiding how you feel
You can bring the villainy (ah-ah-aah)
And I can bring the sex appeal
Leave me something
Or let me out, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of
Things that I want, this happily ever after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my emergency contact
Balanced on a razor blade
Lick you like a battery
Your speakers can't handle the bass
But you look good under the LEDs
Leave me something
Or let me out, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of
Things that I want, this happily ever after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my emergency contact
You're my angel
You're a fucking angel
You're my angel
All mine
Mine
Mine, mine
Mine
Leave me something
Oh my God, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of
Things that I want, this happily ever after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my emergency contact
