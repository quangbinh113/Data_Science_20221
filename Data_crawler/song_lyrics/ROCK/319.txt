Song Name: Lovesick in Public
Throw up cause I'm feeling kinda lovesick
Your tapes running in my head
Getting scratched up bad but I
Can't stop watching it back
Last night you really got in my head
How'd I get hung up on what you did
When all you did was kiss my neck
My brains not listening
Can't hide the evidence
I can't comprehend
The endless loop of me and you
My cheeks red like a cherry
Help me cause I am berry
Lovesick in public
I'm hooked on the way that you taste
I know I'm headed for heartbreak
I caught feelings
No concealing
There is no way
That he doesn't know
I keep you in my little locket
Grow up and call me when you want it
Like that that that that
Don't act like you don't want it bad
Can't lie I can see you watching
How'd you get hung up on what I did
When all I did was pout my lips
My brains not listening
Can't hide the evidence
I can't comprehend
The endless loop of me and you
My cheeks red like a cherry
Help me cause I am berry
Lovesick in public
I'm hooked on the way that you taste
I know I'm headed for heartbreak
I caught feelings
No concealing
There is no way
That he doesn't know
*Grunts*
I'm feeling lovesick
Lovesick in public
Im feeling lovesick
Lovesick in public
Wait
Does anyone have a bag?
I'm gonna
My cheeks red like a cherry
Help me cause I am berry
Lovesick in public
I'm hooked on the way that you taste
I know I'm headed for heartbreak
I caught feelings
No concealing
There is no way
That he doesn't know
