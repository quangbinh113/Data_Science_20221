Song Name: Jump - 2015 Remaster
I get up
And nothing gets me down
You got it tough
I've seen the toughest around
And I know
Baby, just how you feel
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real
Oh can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?
Might as well jump (jump)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Ah-oh, hey you! Who said that?
Baby how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin
So can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?
Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
