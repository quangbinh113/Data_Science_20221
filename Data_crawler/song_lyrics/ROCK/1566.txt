Song Name: I Believe in Miracles
I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive
I'm out here kickin' with the band
I am no longer a solitary man
Every day my time runs out
Live like a fool, that's what I was about
Oh, I believe in miracles
Oh, I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh, oh, I believe in miracles
Oh, oh, I believe in a better world for me and you
Tattooed your name on my arm
I always said, "My girl's a good luck charm"
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live
I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive
Oh, I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh, oh, I believe in miracles
Oh, oh, I believe in a better world for me and you
I close my eyes and think
How it might be?
The future's here today
It's not too late, it's not too late
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh, I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
All right
