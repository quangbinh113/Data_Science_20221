Song Name: Home
The sun goes down in a perfect land
And it's up to you to leave
We know it's quite hard to understand
That this place is incomplete
When all the big tasks are done
When we have reached eternity
Then our will to live has gone
There's nothing to believe
Is it me you've been waiting for?
Is it me you've been longing for?
Haven't you felt something that pulls you back?
A dream has burst, but you'll find peace instead
Is it me you've been waiting for?
Not anymore
It's hard to admit that it's time to go
Back to the battle I assume
At least I know that this age back home
Won't end anytime soon
It's a consolation that
(We will live longer than we thought)
You can say that in the end
The future's not lost
Is it me you've been waiting for?
Is it me you've been longing for?
(Haven't you felt something that pulls you back?)
(A dream has burst, but you'll find peace instead)
(Is it me you've been waiting for?)
Not anymore
I knew that all this beauty, it can't be fucking real
Why couldn't all this progress keep what it promised in my dreams
Condemned to strive for perfection
(But it will never come to this)
Is it me you've been waiting for?
Is it me you've been longing for?
Haven't you felt something that pulls you back?
(A dream has burst, but you'll find peace instead)
(Is it me you've been waiting for?)
Not anymore
Not anymore
