Song Name: Flying
This is how I thought this all would go
Waitin' for contact
Come in, ground control
Stuck on the tarmac
It's takin' its toll
When I could be flying
Yeah, I'm gonna be flying
All systems ready to go
All systems ready to go
I'm gonna be flying high again
I'm gonna be flying till the end
I'm gonna be flying till I'm dead
Can't bring me down where I am
Can't find me when I'm high
These wings were made for flying
The crowds are pourin' in
I can see the sun
I know this ain't right but it's got to be done
Put on my boots and strap on my gun
Like a rocket, I'm climbin'
Wheels up, I'm flying
All systems ready to go
All systems ready to go
I'm gonna be flying high again
I'm gonna be flying till the end
I'm gonna be flying till I'm dead
All systems ready to go
All systems ready to go
You can't bring me down where I am
Flying, flying
I'm gonna be flying high again
I'm gonna be flying till the end
All systems ready to go
I'm gonna be flying, flying
Flying, flying
I'm gonna be flying till I'm dead
Can't bring me down where I am
Can't find me when I'm high
These wings were made for flying
