Song Name: Battle Symphony
I got a long way to go and a long memory
I been searching for an answer, always just out of reach
Blood on the floor, sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage to face my enemies
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake for my battle symphony
For my battle symphony
They say that I don't belong, say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions and for better or worse
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
If I fall, get knocked down, pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down, pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake for my battle symphony
For my battle symphony
