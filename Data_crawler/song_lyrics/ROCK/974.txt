Song Name: Wild Horses - 2009 Mix
Childhood living

Is easy to do
The things you wanted
I bought them for you

Graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you
Slide through my hands
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain

Now you decided
To show me the same
No sweeping exits
Or off stage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind

Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away

Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
I know I dreamed you
A sin and a lie
I have my freedom
But I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living
After we die
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
We'll ride them someday
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
We'll ride them someday
