Song Name: Our Time Is Now
Thunder!
You made us!
Your mental state, afraid of mystic ways
No matter how hard you try, you're bitter all the time
The light we follow, our time is on!
We must let go of the weight pulling us down
Realize you're not alone
They'll love you like a god
Get out there, you belong
Now!
Our time is now!
To conquer!
Our time is now!
Or never!
Thunder!
You raised us!
We've been deceived, today the world is blind
We've lost our sight to the bottom of the sea
No way! Our back to the wall
We'll change the rules, disobey the mentor
Realize you're not alone
They'll love you like a god
Get out there, you belong
Now!
Our time is now!
To conquer!
Our time is now!
Forever!
Go!
Realize you're not alone
They love you like a god
Get out and seize the day
Wow!
