Song Name: Start The Healing
Do you really wanna come with me?
It's hard to see through the eyes of a stranger
Are you ready for the feeling to leave
So that you can breathe and not live with the danger?
But there's always something fighting its way back in
But there's always something pushing me to give in
Do you really wanna make-believe
And try to achieve a little break from the anger?
I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
Do you really wanna prowl with me?
This travesty, it cuts sharp like a razor
Are you ready for your scars to bleed?
You will succeed pulling out the invaders
But there's always something fighting its way back in
But there's always something pushing me to give in
Do you really wanna make-believe
And try to achieve a little break from the anger?
I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
Everything I'm feeling burst into flames
Looking at a soul, it's broken and strain
Every night, the wish is always the same
Keep on hoping that I don't go insane
The more you fall for it
The more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it
The more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it
The more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it
It's never gonna quit
I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
I can take it all away, the feelings
Break apart the pain and start the healing
Break apart the pain and start the healing
Break apart the pain and start the healing
