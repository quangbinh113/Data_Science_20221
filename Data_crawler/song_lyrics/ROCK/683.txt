Song Name: Down On The Corner
Early in the evenin'
Just about supper time
Over by the courthouse
They're startin' to unwind
Four kids on the corner
Tryin' to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out
And he blows it on the harp
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Rooster hits the washboard
People just gotta smile
Blinky thumps a gut bass
And solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out
On his kalamazoo
And Willy goes into a dance
Doubles on kazoo
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
You don't need a penny
Just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel
Won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner
There's a happy noise
People come from all around
To watch the magic boy
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner
Out in the street
