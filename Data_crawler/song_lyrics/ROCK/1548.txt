Song Name: Voices Inside My Head / When The World Is Running Down You Make the Best Of What's Still Around - Live From River Plate Stadium, Buenos Aires
Turn on my V.C.R., same one I've had for years
James Brown on the T. A. M. I. show, same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car, same one I've had for years
Old battery's running down, it ran for years and years
Turn on the radio, the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go, I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo, it's played for years and years
An Otis Redding song, it's all I own
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
Plug in my M.C.I. to exercise my brain
Make records on my own, can't go out in the rain
Pick up the telephone, I've listened here for years
No one to talk to me, I've listened here for years
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When I feel lonely here, don't waste my time with tears
I run 'Deep Throat' again, it ran for years and years
Don't like the food I eat, the cans are running out
Same food for years and years, I hate the food I eat
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
Turn on my V.C.R., same one I've had for years
James Brown on the T. A. M. I. show, same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car, same one I've had for years
