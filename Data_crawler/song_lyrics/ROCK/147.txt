Song Name: Fight Alone
Feeling
Masochistic
Waiting
For you
I'm waiting
Is she taking it
What's mine
Are you wasting it
My time
Are you tempting me
I might lose my mind
Need to control it now
Feel it
When you're touching her
I die
Smell her skin on you
Dont lie
Make a fool of me
I might lose my mind
I can control it now
And I wonder
How long must I fight alone
Before you come and save me from myself
And I wonder
How long must I lie alone
While you're sleeping in a bed with someone else
Oooh
Pushing me
Were crossing it
The line
No more talking
Now's our time
Have a piece of me
I'm losing my mind
Need to control it now
Wanting it
Hit the lights
Your skin
Is touching
My sin
Just take a bite
You're losing your mind
I can control it now
And I wonder
How long must I fight alone
Before you come and save me from myself
And I wonder
How long must I lie alone
While you're sleeping in bed with someone else
Oooh
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need you
Ooh
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need you
Ooh
Ooh
I need your love
I need your love
Need to control it now
I can control it now
And I wonder
How long must I fight alone
Before you come and save me from myself
And I wonder
How long must I lie alone
While you're sleeping in a bed with someone else
Oooh
I need your love
I need your love
I need you love
I need you
Oooh
I need your love
I need your love
I need you love
I need you love
Oooh
