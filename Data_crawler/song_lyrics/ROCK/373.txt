Song Name: Pirate Radio
You can stop the sound coming through my speakers
You can't shut the mouth of the true believers
Last song plays, you can tell me NO
But you can't turn off my pirate radio
Transmission is live
Volume down
Devil's music is sneaking in
Be careful you
Don't play it too loud
The midnight show will soon begin
I'm the outsider
I'm forbidden
I'm the frequency you are not getting
I'm never all alone
Here in my headphones
With every memory I sing along
You can stop the sound coming through my speakers
You can't shut the mouth of the true believers
Last song plays, you can tell me NO
But you can't turn off my pirate radio
Turn my thoughts into words
Pen to paper, bleeding ink
I'm like no verse you've ever heard
Speak my truth to make you think
Another nation
Another station
We lose the signal when the circuit's breaking
I know they're watching
I know they're listening
I know they're listening
So keep listening
You can stop the sound coming through my speakers
You can't shut the mouth of the true believers
Last song plays, you can tell me NO
But you can't turn off my pirate radio
Cut my wires
Light my fire
Try to burn me down
Reconfigure
My transistor
You can't drown me out
You can stop the sound coming through my speakers
You can't shut the mouth of the true believers
Last song plays, you can tell me NO
But you can't turn off my pirate radio
