Song Name: I Feel Fine - Remastered 2015
Baby's good to me
You know, she's happy as can be
You know, she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine
You know, she tells me all the time
You know, she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things
You know, he buys her diamond rings
You know, she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine
You know, she tells me all the time
You know, she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things
You know, he buys her diamond rings
You know, she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Ooh
Ooh
