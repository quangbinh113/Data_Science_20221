Song Name: Divided
Never understood, does hatred do us any good?
We know the answer
Yet we repeat this chapter again and again
When will we wake up?
I can't be the only one who's fed up
Of all the blood-stained headlines
We see loved ones lost, we watch their families cry
They say that strength comes in numbers
So why do we always bring each other down, down, down?
I'm so sick of feeling like we're living life
Inside this great divide, can we find
A way to mend the brokenness?
Divided is no way to live
What will it take for us to step away
From the selfishness that drives us
And stop acting like we're kings?
We see price before we see what's right
We choose power and we don't think twice
'Bout the people that are left behind
Have you ever wondered why?
The ones with less have more inside
(More inside)
Treating every day like they could die
(They could die)
Cherishing the little things
'Cause that's what makes us all the same
I know that you know
(I know, whoa-oh)
They say that strength comes in numbers
So why do we always bring each other down, down, down?
I'm so sick of feeling like we're living life
Inside this great divide, can we find
A way to mend the brokenness?
Divided is no way to live
I don't think that we'll ever learn
'Cause we can never seem
To let go of the urge to burn
To burn everything that's different
Than what we know
But that's just how we have always been
I hope someday we'll change
They say that strength comes in numbers
So why do we always bring each other down, down, down?
I'm so sick of feeling like we're living life
Inside this great divide, can we find
A way to mend the brokenness?
Divided is no way to live
Divided is no way to live
Divided is no way to live
