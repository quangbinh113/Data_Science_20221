Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Ay
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Ho-ho-ho
Why don't you ask him what's going on?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne? (hooga haaga hooga)
Don't say that you love me (hiyee-ha)
Just tell me that you want me (hiyee-ha)
Tusk
Just say that you want me (hiyee-ha)
Don't say that you
Tusk
Real savage-like
Ugh
Tusk
Tusk
Tusk, Tusk, Tusk
Tusk
