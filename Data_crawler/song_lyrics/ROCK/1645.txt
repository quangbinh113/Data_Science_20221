Song Name: Armagideon Time
I play around don't stay around
This old town too long
Seems like I got to
Travel on
A lotta people won't get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
The battle is getting harder
In this iration, Armagideon time
A lotta people running and hiding tonight, ah
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh oh oh
This ol' town
Ivan and Fu-Manchu
They both are coming through, yeah
Yay, a lotta people [Incomprehensible]
A lotta people [Incomprehensible]
Oh remember to kick to it over
No one will guide you, through Armagideon time
It's Armagideon
It's not Christmas time anymore
It's Armagideon
A lotta people
All right, time's up, let's have you out of here
Okay, okay, don't push us when were hot!
A lotta people won't a get no a supper tonight
A lotta people sitting down, by the light, ah!
A lotta people won't a get no a supper tonight
A lotta people a won't get no a justice tonight
Remember, a kick it over
No one will guide you through Armagideon time
