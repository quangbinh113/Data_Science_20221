Song Name: CYAN1DE (feat. Pete Wentz)
Goodbye
Chlorine-clouded skies
Goodbye
I want to watch you burn alive
Yeah
Give a fuck about a party, I'ma stay in the back
I'm cross-faded, mix depression with a panic attack
Ever since I was a kid, I never fit with the crowd
I was hoping by my age I would have figured it out
Talkin' 'bout the shit I lived is like I'm swallowing razors
Try to make it go away, write it down on some paper
And it's tough, 'cause no one wants to feel like they stuck
It's getting darker now and I've had enough
(Hello?)
Goodbye
Chlorine-clouded skies
I want to watch you burn alive
I want to be your cyanide
(On and on, it never ends)
(On and on, it never-)
Tonight, be my lullaby
I want to watch you burn alive
I want to be your cyanide
Yeah
Feel the memories every time when the wind blows
I sit and reminisce about a time it was simple
I've been ruminating, going over the outcomes
A million different ways I could have changed, I was outdone
My insecurities and me, I was so numb
My brain is the only thing that I couldn't outrun, so
What would you do if everything that you touched died?
You lose the motivation to try
(Hello?)
Goodbye
Chlorine-clouded skies
I want to watch you burn alive
I want to be your cyanide
(On and on, it never ends)
(On and on, it never-)
Tonight, be my lullaby
I want to watch you burn alive
I want to be your cyanide
(On and on, it never ends)
(On and on, it never-)
Got a hurricane head for the sad songs
Half-crushed by hyper-love
The slow-killer years
Goodbye isn't-
Goodbye!
Be your cyanide, I'll be your cyanide
Be your cyanide, I'll be your cyanide
Cyanide!
