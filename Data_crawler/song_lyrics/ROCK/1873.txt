Song Name: Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
Ramble on, on and on
But when you're ramblin', days are gone
Who will love you with a love that's true
When you're ramblin', your ramblin' days are gone?
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you, with a love that's true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
