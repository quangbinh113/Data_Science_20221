Song Name: First Night Back in London
The mini cab
The driver is black
At this time of night
You better sit in the back
Got a few smokes
Under your hat
The cops are looking out
For the petrol on the back
At this time I think, so what the hell?
There's that female I know too well
Why should I lean? Get up my mind again
I'm riding in the back alone, stranger rides again
To see my lovely town
That always brings you down
Where every drifter drifts
For many miles around
We take a casual drive
For two miles up the road
The cops pull us over
And search right through our clothes
They give him hell
They check him on the air
I sit there with the drugs in my hair
As soon as I get home
I call Heathrow
Wants a standby fare to Borneo
