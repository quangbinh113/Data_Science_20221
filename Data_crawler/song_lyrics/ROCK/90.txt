Song Name: Crocus
We fight for everything we have
I'm sick of eating all your scraps
I wish I wasn't as hungry as I am
But I want what's coming to me
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
I'm not the one that you wanted
I'm the one that you got
I'm only just getting started
I'm not the one that you wanted
I'm the one that you got
I'm only just getting started
This party's kind of boring, I found out where the door is
You're all so laminated, stainless
Nothing seems to want to stick to you
Who else made it out?
Stick around and find out
'Cause I want what's coming to me
Yeah, I want what's coming to me
I'm not the one that you wanted
I'm the one that you got
I'm only just getting started
I'm not the one that you wanted
I'm the one that you got
I'm only just getting started
Crawling my way to the top
Crawling my way to the top
Crawling my way, crawling my way
Crawling my way to the top
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
Won't somebody give me what I want?
A little bit of luck in a rigged game
'Cause I'm the only dreamer in the world
A little bit of acid in the sick bay
