Song Name: See You Tonight - Live
I know it's around
I don't have any doubts about that night
I'll see you get it tonight, and if I can't, I'll cry and cry
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonight
But I know it's around
I don't have any doubts about that night
I'll see you get it tonight, and if I can't, I'll cry and cry
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonight, outside
I'll see you tonight, outside
I'll see you tonight
I'll see you, get it tonight, and if I can't, I'll cry and cry
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonight, outside
See you tonight, outside
See you tonight
I'll see you, get it tonight, and if I can't, I'll cry and cry
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonight, outside
See you tonight, outside
See you tonight
