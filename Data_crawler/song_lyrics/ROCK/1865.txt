Song Name: Festival
Havin' a nationwide festival for 14 days and nights
Ah, there's 54 bands on a riverboat spot in the lights
100 of vans and tents all on the banks of the Ohio
Bandstands floatin' from Paducah to Cairo
Be over a million freaks there diggin' the sights
There's so many beautiful people be there to love and cheer
Some of the greatest guitar playin' in the western hemisphere
Got the Who, the Band from across the north border Canned Heat
The Fifth Dimension, Creedence Clearwater
Oh, brother Hendrix, sister Joplin, we wish you were here
Early in the mornin', Johnny Cash and old Elvis got loose
By noon, Vanilla Fudge and the Woolies start paying their dues
All evening Ike Turner and Aretha right with the Drifters
And the Coasters in the Loading Zone
All night Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters in a battlin' mood
Oh, what a beautiful show, was sitting right up under the microphone
Diggin' the Grateful Dead, Little Richard and the Rolling Stones
Ray Charles, Led Zeppelin and the Everly Brothers
Bad Bo Diddley and the Beatles and some others
Everybody's laying back and freaking out all week long
