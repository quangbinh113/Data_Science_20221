Song Name: This Ain't A Love Song
Should've seen it coming when the roses died
Should've seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should've listened, when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
Baby ain't it funny how we never ever learnt to fall?
You're really on your knees
You think you're standing tall
But only fools, are know-it-alls
And I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny
Love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I've got for you's gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Baby I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
Clowns wore smiles, that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things, never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving
Oh-ooh, oh-oooh
If the love that I got for you's gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling's so strong
Is the reason, I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Oooh-oh
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I got for you's gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling's so strong
Is the reason, I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong
Yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
