Song Name: KIDS
(Kids, kids)
(Living in the city)
(Tryna make it in the world)
I don't listen to a man
I only listen to my friends and all my friends are on drugs
You don't need to understand it, yeah
'Cause you're a big man
Everything is automatic
If you want it, you can have it straight to your door
I don't think I know the answers
(But I ain't trying too hard)
Kids, kids
Living in the city
Tryna make it in the world
We're just kids, kids
Living in the city
Tryna make it in the world (yeah, oh, yeah, I)
I like boys who dress like girls
Who dress like boys that text like girls
I text my boys, "I lost my girl, 'cause she likes girls"
(That's alright, that's okay, baby)
16, fell in love with my best friend
Strawberry lip gloss kiss made my head spin
Premature love, I'll never forget it
Kids see ghosts, chase 'em down towards a dead end
Turned 18, didn't learn my lesson
No serotonin, faking all my expressions
Balancing alcohol and depression
Sweaty palms, cutting through all the tension
I don't blame you for who you are
And I don't blame you for what you did
We're just kids, kids
Living in the city
Tryna make it in the world
We're just kids, kids
Living in the city
Tryna make it in the world
(We're just kids, kids)
(Living in the city)
(Tryna make it in the world)
(We're just kids) you don't (kids)
Don't (living in the city)
Understand
