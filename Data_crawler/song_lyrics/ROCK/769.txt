Song Name: Rock the Blues Away
Drivin' in my car
I'm heading for the local bar
Pickin' up my girl tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Shootin' pool with my friends
Smokin' cigarettes
Tellin' jokes out loud
Laughing with the crowd
And we're rocking
And we're rolling
And we're laughing
And we're joking
And we rocking
Baby we rocking and rolling
We won't get the blues because we
Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
And when I'm on the way back home
Listening to the radio
I hear some great rock sounds
That make you wanna sing out loud
And we're rocking
And we're rolling
And we're laughing
And we're joking
And we rocking
Baby we rocking and rolling
We won't get the blues because we
Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day, yeah yeah
Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
