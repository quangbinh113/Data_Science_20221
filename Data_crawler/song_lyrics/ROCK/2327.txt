Song Name: Sweetest Thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
She won't catch me or break my fall
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this I'm a rain cloud
You know she like a dry kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
I'm losing you
Yeah, hey, hey
I'm losing you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
I wanted to run but she made me crawl
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
Oh oh, the sweetest thing
You know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
Mine is a blind kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
I'm losing you
Oh oh oh, I'm losing you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Oh oh yeah
My my, oh my baby
My my, oh my baby
My my, oh my baby
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
You can sew it up but you still see the tear
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
And in this I'm a rain cloud
You know we got a stormy kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Yeah
The sweetest thing
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
