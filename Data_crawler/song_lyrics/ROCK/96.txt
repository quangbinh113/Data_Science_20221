Song Name: The End (feat. Scarlxrd)
I don't feel it when they talk on me, I won't take it
Get the fuck from 'round me, let's face it
You can't dive in this back in my basement
If you don't get what I'm saying, I'm not changing for you
Problems, I got too many of 'em
So I'm running through the days to catch up on 'em
I got plenty of 'em
No one hates me more than I do
So I'm the only one that decidin' when the end is coming
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct, will you stand up in my face?
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
N-Nah you, fuck that you aimin', we bust back
Won't do representin' we bombin' and trust that
Hold my momma, issa problem whenever we come back
Y'all want that precision, with this it is unmatched, I
Notice how they look at me
I run myself right through the wall
I don't worry 'bout it at all
Understand I'm everything that you couldn't be
Because I put myself through hell
I'm guessin' that you can tell
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct, will you stand up in my face?
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
Holding myself back
Hoping I don't crash
For the last time my hands on my breaks
None of this shit was planned as my fate
Run your mouth, get you into your grave
And none of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct, will you stand up in my face?
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
Hoping this time I won't break
