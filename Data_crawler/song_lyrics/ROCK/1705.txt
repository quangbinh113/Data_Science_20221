Song Name: Dirty Love (feat. Iggy Pop)
Oh woah-oh-oh
It's Iggy POP
Oh woah-oh-oh
Yeah and Kesha
Oh woah-oh-oh
Alright, get up!
Yeah!
Ah!
Don't want your money
I got my own!
You're not my daddy
Baby, I'm full grown!
Don't complicate it
Don't tell me lies!
I'm not your girlfriend
I ain't never gonna be
Oh, your wife!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
All I need is to get
In between your sheets!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
Cockroaches do it
In garbage cans
Rug merchants do it
In Afghanistan
Santorum did it
In a V-neck sweater
Pornos produce it
But wild child can do it better!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
All I need is to get
In between your sheets!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
I don't want your fancy things
I just want your love
Champagne tastes like piss to me
I just want your love
Keep your leopard limousine
I just want your love
I just want your fucking filthy love!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love!
All I need is to get
In between your sheets!
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh!
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
I just want your dirty love
(I just want you dirty love)
(Dirty love, dirty love)
Yeah, cool, alright, I'm cool
Me too
