Song Name: tear gas
Never afraid to be despicable, no
Stood at the brink and you're still looking for the last laugh
You're only crying from the tear gas
Somebody turn us inside out
Maybe you think that I'm too cynical, yeah
Freezing to death, stood in the shadow of an avalanche
Are you looking at the hourglass?
It's do or die
Any other time than now, any other time than now
Just one life
I guess you're gonna go to Hell, guess you're gonna go to Hell
Tell a lie
Anything is possible, we could be unstoppable
Be less than no one to me, just leave me in the mercy seat
Surely this ain't the fucking pinnacle? No
These modern saints would have us writing our own epitaph
Well, we knew that it would never last
Somebody turn us inside out...
There's nothing left of ourselves that we won't sell
Do or die
Any other time than now, any other time than now
Just one life
I guess you're gonna go to Hell, guess you're gonna go to Hell
Tell a lie
Anything is possible, we could be unstoppable
Be less than no one to me, just leave me in the mercy seat
We are well aware
No one can stand without a spine
But if we never dare
We'll only flatten out the line, oh
We are well aware
No one can stand without a spine
But if we never dare
We'll only flatten out the line
Do or die
Any other time than now, any other time than now
Just one life
I guess you're gonna go to Hell, guess you're gonna go to Hell
Tell a lie
Anything is possible, we could be unstoppable
Be less than no one to me, just leave me in the mercy seat
We are well aware
No one can stand without a spine
But if we never dare
We'll only flatten out the line
