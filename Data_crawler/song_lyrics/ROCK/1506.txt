Song Name: All This Music Must Fade
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine)
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
And that's it
We never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
I'm long gone
And I ain't never coming back
I've never really quite gone bland
I'm not blue, I'm not pink
I'm just grey, I'm afraid
And it seems in a blink
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
I don't mind
Other guys ripping off my song
I'd be a liar
If I said I never done no wrong
Oh, this sound that we share
Has already been played
And it hangs in the air
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
And that's it
'Cause we never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours
(Yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
And what's mine is mine, and what's mine is yours
Who gives a fuck?)
