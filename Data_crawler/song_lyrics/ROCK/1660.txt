Song Name: Real Wild Child (Wild One)
I'm a real wild one (wild one, wild one, wild one, wild one)
Well I'm just out of school
Like I'm real, real cool
Got to dance like a fool
Got the message that I got to be a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child
Going to meet all my friends
Going to have ourself a ball
Going to tell my friends
Going to tell them all
That I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child
I'm a real wild one and I like wild fun
In a world gone crazy, everything seems hazy
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Ooh baby, I'm a wild one
Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child
