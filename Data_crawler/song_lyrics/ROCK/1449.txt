Song Name: The Unknown Soldier
Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier
Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn living, living dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head
And it's all over
For the unknown soldier
It's all over
For the unknown soldier
Company, halt!
Present arms!
Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier
Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Bullet strikes the helmet's head
And it's all over
The war is over
It's all over
War is over
It's all over, baby
All over, baby
Oh, over, yeah
All over, baby
All over
All over, baby
Oh, oh, yeah
All over
All over
