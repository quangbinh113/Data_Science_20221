Song Name: Loves Missing
She's thinking
About something we all need
All need
Clock's ticking
Not giving her room to breathe
To breathe
Love's screaming
Love's missing
Love's screaming
So quietly and in pain
Love's absent
It's failing her once again, again
Love's screaming
Love's screaming
Dark future
She just needs someone to say
To say, "I love you"
Before she gets pushed away

Love's absent
Love's absent
The center won't hold me in
Love's absent
And she cannot touch a friend
A friend
She's breathing
And that isn't gonna help
No help
Clock's ticking
It's bad when she's by herself
Herself
Love's screaming
Love's missing
Love's screaming
Screaming
