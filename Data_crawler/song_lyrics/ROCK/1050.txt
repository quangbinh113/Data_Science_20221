Song Name: Angel
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes, it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love
I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love
A dog without a bone
What can I do?
I'm sleeping in this bed alone
Baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby, baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and take me all right
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
