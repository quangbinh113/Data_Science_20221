Song Name: Parasite
Beam me up softboy
With your lines about Freud and Jung
Standing in the corner of the party
Laughing at the meme, they don't know I'm a bug
Have you even fucking lived yet?
Standing at the back of the room never having any fun
Paraphrasing nasty women
And then forgotten all the context 'cause you never finish 'em
You're itching
You can really feel it in your blood
Skin crawling
Every single time you see his name pop up
He's wretched
Kitchen full of glasses
Stolen from a two mile radius
Pint glasses
And a drawer full of out of date Valium
The prince of East London
But he lives with his parents out in Islington
Ain't got a car, he's got a skateboard
Proud owner of a DUI at age 19
You're itching
You can really feel it in your blood
Skin crawling
Every single time you see his name pop up
He's wretched
You can really feel it in his love
Heart breaking
Every single time it never feels enough
He's a parasite
But he thinks he's a comedian
You won't be laughing in the morning
When you're trying to find a clinic with a free appointment
Better safe than sorry, girl
Too little, too late and now you've been burned
But at least you ain't pregnant
He's a parasite in a parasitic world
He's a parasite
He's a parasite
He's a parasite
The boy's a parasite
You're itching
You can really feel it in your blood
Skin crawling
Every single time you see his name pop up
He's wretched
You can really feel it in his love
Heart breaking
Every single time it never feels enough
He's a parasite
Parasite for bad blood
Parasite
He's a parasite for bad blood
