Song Name: Beside You
I been hungry way down in my heart
Waiting for a reason
I been hungry like a lot of guys
I want to be beside you
Lonely people pass me in the street
Waiting for a reason
Beslde you
Grey is turning to blue
You wake up loye in me
Beslde you
Everything is new
You wake up love in me
I been hungry way down where it hurts
Waiting for a reason
I been hungry like a lot of guys
I wanna be beside you
Beslde you
Grey is turnin to blue
You wake up love in me
Beside you
Everything is new
You wake up love in me
What a world
I really need you girl
You wake up love in me
Beside you
Grey is turning to blue
You wake up loye in me
Beside you beside you
I want to be beside you
