Song Name: Live Like This
(I don't wanna die but I can't live like)
(I don't wanna die but I can't live like)
Do you feel it slipping away?
There's no meaning, just count the days
While I waste away
And I never thought that I would lose a war with myself
I'm dying for a chance to put my weapons down
Fighting is a bitter pill
When all you've got is time to kill
With my final breath
Take me home again
'Cause I've got nothing left
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this, like this
Wave the white flag, I'm at the end
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this
There's gotta be a difference
Between life and existence
There's something missing
And I never thought karma could find her way out
I'm trapped in the center of a carousel
Everyone is standing still
And all I've got is time to kill
With my final breath (with my final breath)
Take me home again (take me home again)
'Cause I've got nothing left
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this, like this
Wave the white flag, I'm at the end
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this, like this
Wave the white flag, I'm at the end
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this
(With my final breath)
(Take me home again)
('Cause I've got nothing left)
I can't live like this, (I can't live) like this (like this)
Wave the white flag, I'm at the end
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this (with my final breath)
Like this (like this) (take me home again)
Wave the white flag, ('cause I've got nothing left) wave the white flag
I don't wanna die but I can't live like this
