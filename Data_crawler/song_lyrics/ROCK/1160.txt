Song Name: Fuckin' in the Bushes
We put this festival on you bastards
With a lotta love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down
And you wanna destroy it?
Well, you go to hell
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
I love it
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
Kids running around naked fucking in the bushes
I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, I love them
Fun
Nice
Life
Youths
Beautiful
I'm all for it
I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, I love them
Fun
Nice
Life
Youths
Beautiful
I'm all for it
