Song Name: Ditch
I don't give a goddamn
About your demands
Just spit your trash and take a bow
I've heard it all before, a running mouth
The deviants and miscreants break their vows
You can all keep digging, I'm crawling out
You're face down, down in a ditch that you dug yourself
You can live and die by the hand you're dealt
Unwound consequence and you can never tell
Live or die by the hand you're dealt
Blinded by revenge
And your cowardice
They're all so scared again, it's so American
Here in the home of the brave and the terrified
Who can we blame this time? Back of the fucking line
We're running out of excuses, we're out of lies
You're face down, down in a ditch that you dug yourself
You can live and die by the hand you're dealt
Unwound consequence and you can never tell
Live or die by the hand you're dealt
Down in a ditch that you dug yourself
You can live and die by the hand you're dealt
Unwound consequence and you can never tell
Live or die by the hand you're dealt
You demand a life you haven't earned
Entitled, soft, and soon to learn
There's no shoulders here for crying
You command an ego gone unchecked
Unbridled needs for cheap respect
But your dreams were built for dying
Built for dying
You're face down, down in a ditch that you dug yourself
You can live and die by the hand you're dealt
Unwound consequence and you can never tell
Live or die by the hand you're dealt
Down in a ditch that you dug yourself
You can live and die by the hand you're dealt
Unwound consequence and you can never tell
Live or die by the hand you're dealt
You're down in a ditch
