Song Name: Rock 'N' Roll All Nite - Live
You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancing and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting
(C'mon and clap your hands, clap those hands)
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're looking fancy and I like your style
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy (Peter)
You say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun so let me in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting
(I wanna hear everybody sing, sing)
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
(Solo)
You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night (c'mon, clap your hands) and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
Thank you, thank you
Alright
Thanks so much, goodnight
