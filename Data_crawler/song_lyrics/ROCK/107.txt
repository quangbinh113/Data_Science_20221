Song Name: Soldier On!
No reason left for living, living all alone
And dying unforgiven, with unforgiven bones
Dead years and the dread years
They were all throughout your life
The road was soon your mistress
And the stage became your wife, oh
Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear
They get down on their knees and pray
Of all the battles won and lost
The lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on
Watching mankind destroy itself
Walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on
No reason left for dying, dying to be right
Days living unforgiven, and unforgiven nights
Lean years and the mean years
They were all throughout your life
Two steps forward and two steps back
You're out of time, oh, no
Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear
They get down on their knees and pray
Of all the battles won and lost
The lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on
Watching mankind destroy itself
Walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on
Of all the battles won and lost
The lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on
Watching mankind destroy itself
Walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on
Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear
They get down on their knees and pray
Of all the battles won and lost
The lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on
Watching mankind destroy itself
Walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on
Of all the battles won and lost
The lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on
Watching mankind destroy itself
Walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on
Up for a run in the morning air
(Up for a run in the morning air)
I got no job, but I got long hair
(I got no job, but I got long hair)
I got no woman waiting back at home
(I got no woman waiting back at home)
I got all I need, I just soldier on
(I got all I need, I just soldier on)
