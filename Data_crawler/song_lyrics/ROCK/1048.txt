Song Name: Amazing
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy
To see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
And when I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave
But couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin' that I would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye
You finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives
You know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
For the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings, yeah

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen
To all that righteous talk, oh yeah
Well, I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay
Alive
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye
You finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives
That you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
For the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts
Baby wanna see what I can give her tonight
Oh, baby, oh baby, oh baby no
Say you wanna go
Love is so amazing
No, no
Never let me go
No, no
It's love, love
It's love, it's love, love
It's love, it's love, love
And it's love
So, from all of us at Aerosmith
To all of you out there, wherever you are
Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel may be you
Goodnight
