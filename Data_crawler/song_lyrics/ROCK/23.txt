Song Name: Sleepwalking
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame
It's all fun and games 'til you don't wanna play now
Run away, run away, run away
It's easy to say but it's harder to say now
You're onto something else
I'm a picture left on your shelf
The dream's a lie I tell myself
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Wide awake but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til a whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicate 'til my brain goes numb
Like a dream where your feet won't run
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (gone, gone)
(Sleepwalking when you're gone)
Took a flight to the west coast
I fell asleep at the window
Suddenly I feel my body
Fallin' fast into visions of you
Movin' onto someone else
I'm a picture left on your shelf
And the dream's a lie I tell myself
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Wide awake but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til a whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicate 'til my brain goes numb
Like a dream where your feet won't run
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (gone, gone)
(Sleepwalking when you're gone)
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame
It's all fun and games 'til you don't wanna play now
Run away, run away, run away
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
(Feel like I'm sleep-)
Wide awake but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til a whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicate 'til my brain goes numb (goes numb)
Like a dream where your feet won't run (won't run)
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (gone, gone)
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (gone, g-gone, g-g-gone, gone, g-g-gone)
