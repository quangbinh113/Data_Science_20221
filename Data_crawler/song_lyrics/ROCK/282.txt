Song Name: Coming For Blood (feat. From Ashes To New)
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
'Cause I was born, bred, made for this
Battleground, we slay for this
Yeah, I was born, bred dangerous
Can't stop now, we slave for this
And I'm right back up, baby, face in the fire
Showing you what I'm made of
Come on dig my grave, try to bury me alive
I'll rise right back up
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit, bleeding 'til I bleed out
Even if the worst is yet to come
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit, bleeding 'til I bleed out
Give it all I've got to get back up
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
Yeah
This time I'm coming for blood
Yeah
Where do you think I came up?
Never had nothing but knew what the pain was
How do you think I stayed up?
Playing with fire to feel what the flame was
I've taken a beating
Every day scheming to bury my weakness
And now that you're bleeding
You'll see you've been digging in right where your grave was
And I'm right back up, baby, face in the fire
Showing you what I'm made of
(You'll never keep me down)
Come on dig my grave, try to bury me alive
I'll rise right back up (Get up)
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit, bleeding 'til I bleed out
Even if the worst is yet to come
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit, bleeding 'til I bleed out
Give it all I've got to get back up
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
And I'm right back up, baby, face in the fire
Showing you what I'm made of
Come on dig my grave, try to bury me alive
I'll rise right back up
(I'm never bleeding out, you'll never keep me down)
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit
(Get down)
Bleeding 'til I bleed out
(Right now)
Even if the worst is yet to come
(The worst is yet, the worst is yet to come)
I can take another hit, hit
Bruised, broken and beat down
Hit, hit
(Get down)
Bleeding 'til I bleed out
(Right now)
Give it all I've got to get back up
(I gotta get up, I gotta get up)
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
This time I'm coming for blood
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
This time I'm coming for blood
'Cause this time I'm coming for blood
