Song Name: Break The News
I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
We're laying in
I'm so happy that it's raining out again
I'm so made up that we're naked in our bed
Like we were twenty-four back when
Who will hammer out
The deeper question needing sorting out?
If there's an answer we'll find it
Without doubt
We're a little more than friends
We fell through time and space
And cast upon this place
And so far we've been saved
I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
I never wanna bring you down, no
I never wanna bring you down
It's raining out
I'm so made up, we've been making out
Watching movies in our dressing gowns
Like we were twenty-four or there about
What matters most, life's amazing
But it's been a bumpy road
No more than lately thing's have been a little wild
Am I an adult or a child?
Don't feel any different now
We watch the world go by
And so far we've been fine
I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
I never wanna bring you down
We fell through time and space
We cast upon this place
And so far we've been saved
I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
I never wanna bring you down
I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown
Never wanna see you down
Never wanna see you down, no
