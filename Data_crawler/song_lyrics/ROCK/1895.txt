Song Name: Stuck on You
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-sugar
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
I try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Oh yeah, uh-uh-uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
I try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah-ye, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah-ye, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah ye, because I'm
Stuck on you
