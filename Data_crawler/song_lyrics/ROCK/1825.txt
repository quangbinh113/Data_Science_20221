Song Name: Surfin' Safari - Mono/Remastered 2001
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on a safari with me
(Come on a safari with me)
Early in the mornin', we'll be startin' out
Some honeys will be comin' along
We're loading up our Woody with our boards inside
And headin' out singin' our song
Come on, baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Come along, baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on a safari with me
(Come on a safari with me)
At Huntington and Malibu they're shootin' the pier
At Rincon they're walkin' the nose
We're goin' on safari to the islands this year
So if you're comin', get ready to go
Come on, baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Come along, pretty baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on a safari with me
(Come on a safari with me)
They're anglin' in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Dohini too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild, it's gettin' bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru
Come on, baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Come along, pretty baby, wait and see (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Yes, I'm gonna take you surfin' with me (Surfin', surfin' safari)
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on a safari with me
(Come on a safari with me)
(Surfin' safari)
Yeah, me (Surfin' safari)
With me (Surfin' safari)
Yeah, me (Surfin' safari)
With me (Surfin' safari)
