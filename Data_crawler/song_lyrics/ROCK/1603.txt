Song Name: You Sound Like You're Sick - 2002 Remaster
Well, I can't understand
Anything about you
Help you if I can
What can I do
And here's your new home
That's where you must be
In the institution
'Cause you're so lazy
But if you must act up
Again and again
Well, everybody knows
You're a hopeless problem
Here's your new home
That's where you must be
In the institution
'Cause you're so lazy
You sound like you're sick
You look like you're sick too
You sound like you're sick
But if you must act up
Again and again
Well, everybody knows
You're a hopeless problem
And here's your new home
That's where you must be
In the institution
'Cause you're so lazy
You sound like you're sick
You look like you're sick too
You sound like you're sick
Well, I can't understand
Anything about you
Help you if I can
What can I do
And here's your new home
That's where you must be
In the institution
'Cause you're so lazy
You sound like you're sick
You look like you're sick too
You sound like you're sick
You look like you're sick too
Well, you sound like you're sick
You sound like you're sick
