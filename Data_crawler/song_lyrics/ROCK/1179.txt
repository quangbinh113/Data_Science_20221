Song Name: Idlers Dream
My heart it skips a beat when I behold
The light that's shining through
Your eyes of gold
From heavenly blood you seem to spring
From heavenly waters you can drink
I'll meet you on a day that never ends
I'll greet you in a way that heaven meant
You lay me down gently on the leaves
You cover me over in my sleep
I never did say and I wish I could
I never could pray 'cos it's just no good
I hope you don't break up my heart of stone
I don't wanna scream out loud
And wake up on my own
And as I close my eyes
And the sky turns red
I realise just what you are
You're an idler's dream
And your're singing shang-ri-la

Shang-ri-la
Shang-ri-la
Shang-ri-la
