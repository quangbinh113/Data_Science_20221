Song Name: The Twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And go like this
Yeah, twist, baby, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss
And do the twist
My daddy is sleepin'
And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy's just sleepin'
And mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty, twisty, twisty
Till we tear the house down
Come on and twist, yeah, baby twist (round and round and round)
Ooh yeah, just like this (round and round and round)
Come on, little miss
And do the twist, yeah (round and round and round)
(Round and round and round and round)
(Round and round and round and round)
(Round and round and round and round)
Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist
Come on and twist, yeah, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this (round and round and round and round)
Come on, little miss (round and round and round and round)
And do the twist (round and round and round and round)
Yeah, that's all rock (round and round and round and round)
Yeah, twist on now, twist (round and round and round and round)
