Song Name: Werewolf
I can feel you; I can hear you howling in my bones
There's an evil lurking in the dark (there's an evil lurking in the dark)
Ever-shifting, skin is ripping as you take control
I can't tell where you end and where I start (there's an evil lurking in the dark)
A ferocious diagnosis under moonlit hands
Will the man become the monster, or the monster become man?
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright in the full moonlight
You can run, but you can't hide
I could be honest; I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But no one can break my heart like I can
(Werewolf)
Bleed the neon from the bite marks, ever bittersweet
Smile for the camera, but don't flash your teeth (everybody loves a mystery)
Let the bodies hit the dance floor to this heartbreak beat
I feel like somebody's watching me (feels like everybody's watching me)
Seductively destructive, we are true romance
Does the man become the monster, or the monster become man?
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright in the full moonlight
You can run, but you can't hide
I could be honest; I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But you can't break my heart like I can
Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
You can't break my heart like I can
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking; feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
But you can't break my heart like I can
And in the pale moonlight, a debt to be paid
For one must suffer for all eternity
Nothing lasts forever, even guilty pleasures, oh
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
Don't wanna feel
I could be honest; I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head, oh
Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
You can't break my heart like I can
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking; feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
(Werewolf)
