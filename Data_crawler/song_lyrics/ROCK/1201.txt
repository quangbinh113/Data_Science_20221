Song Name: Emotional Rescue - Remastered 2009
Is there nothing I can say, nothing I can do
To change your mind? I'm so in love with you
You're too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you!
Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?
Just like the night, they dissolve off in sleep
I'll be your saviour, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh pfff
Yeah, the other night, cryin'
Cryin' baby. yeah I'm cryin'
Yeah I'm like a child baby, I'm like a child baby, like a child,
Yeah like a child, like a child, like a child, like a child
Ooh!
You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekinese
I'll be your saviour, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Yeah, I was dreamin' last night baby
Last night... I was dreamin' that you'd be mine
But I was cryin' yeah... like a child
Yeah I was cryin'... cryin' like a child
Could be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine all mine!
You could be mine, could be mine, could be mine all mine!
I come to you, so silent in the night
So stealthy, so animal quiet
I'll be your saviour, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, you should be mine, mine, ooh!
Mmm
Yes, you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armor coming to your emotional rescue
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine!
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine!
I will be your knight in shining armour
Riding across the desert
On a fine Arab charger
Pfff
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
(Ooh ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah)
