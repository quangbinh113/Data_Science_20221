Song Name: I Wanna Be Sedated - 2002 Remaster
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just get me to the airport
And put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh-oh-oh-oh

20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just get me to the airport
And put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh-oh-oh-oh
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair
And get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Before I go loco
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh-oh-oh-oh
20, 20, 24 hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair
And get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Before I go loco
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh-oh-oh-oh
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
Bam, bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, bam, ba-bam
I wanna be sedated
