Song Name: The Retaliators Theme (21 Bullets) (feat. Mötley Crüe, Asking Alexandria, Ice Nine Kills, From Ashes To New)
Well, an eye for an eye, a throat for a throat
A dream never dies, but sometimes it chokes
I wish you were here to show me the way
Who would you kill? Who would you save?
And now that you're gone, I've slipped off the rails
I've prayed for revenge, but I'm afraid I will fail
Because we live in a world
Where even the angels are
Retaliators, retaliators
There's blood on my hands, I see the holy father
Tasted revenge and it's as sweet as holy water
Retaliators, retaliators
I'm throwing away all the blessings I gave her
21 bullets, but it's not gonna save her
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
A fang for a fang, a knot on a rope
The sound of the dead is what gives me hope
But the blood on my tongue and the sweat on my neck
You can't outrun what comes for you next
And now that you're gone, I've slipped off the rails
I've prayed for revenge, but I'm afraid I will fail
Because we live in a world
Where even the angels are
Retaliators, retaliators
There's blood on my hands, I see the holy father
Tasted revenge and it's as sweet as holy water
Retaliators, retaliators
I'm throwing away all the blessings I gave her
21 bullets, but it's not gonna save her
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
Retaliators, retaliators
There's blood on my hands, I see the holy father
Tasted revenge and it's as sweet as holy water
Retaliators, retaliators
I'm throwing away all the blessings I gave her
21 bullets, but it's not gonna save her
Retaliators, retaliators
There's blood on my hands, I see the holy father
Tasted revenge and it's as sweet as holy water
Retaliators, retaliators
I'm throwing away all the blessings I gave her
21 bullets, but it's not gonna save her
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
21 bullets, 21 guns
21 daughters, 21 sons
