Song Name: Back Door Man
Wha, yeah
C'mon, yeah
Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Oh, yeah, ma
Yeah, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
Hey, all you people that tryin' to sleep
I'm out to make it with my midnight dream, yeah
'Cause I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand, all right, yeah
You men eat your dinner, eat your pork and beans
I eat more chicken than any man ever seen, yeah, yeah
I'm a back door man, whoa
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
Well, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
Whoa, baby, I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
