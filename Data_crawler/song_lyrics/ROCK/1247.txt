Song Name: Friends Will Be Friends - Remastered 2011
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctor's on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down
But somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life
Without him in your way
It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end
It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end
(Friends will be friends)
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause right 'til the end
(Friends will be friends) yeah, yeah
