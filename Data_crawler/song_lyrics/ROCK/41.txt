(Ahh)
Ridin' up uptown
Head down
Heart full
Look you up
Fake smile
I'm zombie proof
No killin' me
I ain't stut-stut-stut-stutter
No enemy
Pardon I pop-pop-pop my collar
My energy еndless
I'm losing it every night
I grow a nеw smile
Lay my body on ice
And I know my bad luck
My heads grow faster
Get cut right after
It's magic
One headed
Two-headed
Three-headed monster
Three-headed
Two-headed
One headed monster
One headed
Two-headed
Three-headed monster
Three-headed
Two-headed
One headed
Run 'til sundown
Sunset, no fun now
Up now
I'll chew
Two heads chopped
I'm one now
Screwed up
Black holes
No nuisance
What's a pitchfork to a shooter?
What's a villager to my monster
With a flame torch to a judas?
You gon' have to fight me
Palms up and catch the lightning
You been acting angel like a pisces
God like, isn't likely
You been evil since people been people
You gon' burn it up, ooh-hoo
(Evil, since people)
(You gon' burn it up, ooh-hoo)
(Evil, since people)
(Been evil)
