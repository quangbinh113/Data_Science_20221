Song Name: Snvkes
Am I the devil or in his wake?
Cuz everything I love is burning down around me
You say forever
And that is what we will be
But your every bite is buried breaking not only skin
I say please lover
There's a light I can see
But all the streets are dark
I'm feeling more like a freak
I'll keep on climbing up the ladder to reach
Nothing cuz I'm hoping that the devil catches me
In the moment
Ahhhh hahaha!
You're feeling lucid?
I'm feeling lucid
You're feeling lucid too?
Urghhhh
I keep on running
Away from the scene
Batter the hatches
And smell out your sin
You keep on biting to see how it tastes
If you like poison my flavour is great
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me
Am I the devil or in his wake?
Cuz everything I love is burning down around me
Well I never bought this heaven and hell
But this heat is so damn hot I feel like meat on a grill
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
My boots are full of snakes and I hope they keep me dancing
