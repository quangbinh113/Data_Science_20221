Song Name: You Never Can Tell
It was a teenage weddin'
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two-room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
700 little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a souped-up jitney
Was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was
Wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a teenage weddin'
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
