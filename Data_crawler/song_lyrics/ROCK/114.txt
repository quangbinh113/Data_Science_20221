Song Name: Golden
After all the roses have bloomed in the garden
The beauty of the song bird is not forgotten
The cracks in the sky just let the light in
The rain from below won't hide the sunshine on me
And one day you'll be free
When your golden cage is empty
And you've made your great escape
They can do what they want with your flesh and your bones
But your soul they cannot take
Before all the gods are in their glory
You wrote the greatest chapter in melody's story
Your words on the wall
They shine like diamonds
The pieces won't fall
You've stood with giants all along
A king of Babylon
When your golden cage is empty
And you've made your great escape
They can do what they want with your flesh and your bones
But your soul they cannot take
Yeah, your soul they cannot take
Because of all these dreams that you kept awake
I found the way
Back to my own sanctuary
The light of day
The light of the day
The light of the day
When your golden cage is empty
And you've made your great escape
They can do what they want with your flesh and your bones
But your soul they cannot take
Yeah, your soul they cannot take
