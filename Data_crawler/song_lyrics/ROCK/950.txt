Song Name: I Wanna Touch U
I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue
I wanna touch U - Yeah
I get high on U
I'm on fire over U
And I can't let U go
I can't let U go
I got love on the rise
And I burn like a fire
Got my eye on the prize
Got love in my sights
And I can't let U go
I can't let U go
Give me no reasons
Give me no rhymes
Give me that feelin'
All of the time
I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue
I wanna touch U - Yeah, baby, that is true
I wanna touch U - Nobody else will do, no
I wanna touch U - 'Cos a little too much
Could never be enough, no
I get wired on U
And I thrill to your touch
Yeah, I excite over U
Can't stop this landslide of love
And I can't let U go
I can't let U go, oh
I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue
I wanna touch U - I wanna touch U, yeah
I wanna touch U - Oh, till we get it right
I wanna touch U - Yeah, make it last all night
I wanna touch U - Baby U excite
I wanna touch U - 'Cos a little too much
Could never be enough, now
