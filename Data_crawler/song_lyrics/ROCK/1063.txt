Song Name: Train Kept a Rollin'
Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kinda look the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
Well, get along
Sweet little woman, get along on your way
Well, get along
Sweet little woman, get along on your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kinda looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her
Well, get along
Sweet little woman, get along on your way
Well, get along
Sweet little woman, get along on your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her
Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must've thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Lookin' so good, I couldn't let her go
Ooh, but I just couldn't tell her so
I said train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Tain kept a-rollin' all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her
