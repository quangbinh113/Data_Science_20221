Song Name: Dirty Punk
Gonna be a dirty punk
Gonna crowd your neighbourhood
To the sound of rebel funk
Turn it up loud, like it should
I could hear your mama scream
She's gonna waste herself away
When your daddy smashed that TV screen
I understood what he had to say
I'm going to get me a big, big, big, big, big car
Then I'm gonna drive, drive, drive, I'm gonna drive so far
Up your boulevard, up your boulevard
So far, up your boulevard
Gonna be a dirty punk
While my brother dresses clean
He used to be the local hunk
The girls all ride in my machine
How about the time I made them drunk
And they insult my brotherhood
I shout: "I am a dirty punk
Gonna rock your neighbourhood!"
Gonna to get a big, big, big, big, big car
Then I'm gonna drive, drive, drive, drive so far
Up your boulevard, up your boulevard
So far, up your boulevard
Gonna to get a big, big, big - go faster!
Then I'm gonna go, this ghetto blaster
Up your boulevard, up your boulevard
Go so far, up your boulevard
Gonna drive my a big, big, big, big, big car
Gonna drive, drive, drive, drive so far
Up your backyard, down the boulevard
So far, down the boulevard
