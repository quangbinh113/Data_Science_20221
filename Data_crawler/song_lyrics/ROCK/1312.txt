Song Name: A Pillow of Winds
A cloud of eiderdown draws around me, softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side, and she's breathing low
And the candle dies
When night comes down, you lock the door, the book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by, the seasons change, the wind is warm
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan, behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling in a golden dawn
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side, and she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird in the haze, when the first rays touch the sky and the night wings die
