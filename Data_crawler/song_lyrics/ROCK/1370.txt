Song Name: Voodoo Child (Slight Return)
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah
'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
Wanna say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of this days
Ha-ha-ha
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days
Oh, yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I, I'll meet ya on the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late
'Cause I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
Hey-hey-hey
I'm voodoo child, baby
I don't take no for an answer
Questions? No
