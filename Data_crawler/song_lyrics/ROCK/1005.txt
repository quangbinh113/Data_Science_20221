Song Name: War Machine
Wanna bite the hand that feeds me
Wanna turn the tides
Set the demons free and watch 'em fly

Strike down the one who leads me
I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine, yeah
Take the reins of power and seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason
Let the arrows fly
Your freedom's just a state of mind, yeah
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine, yeah
You better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
