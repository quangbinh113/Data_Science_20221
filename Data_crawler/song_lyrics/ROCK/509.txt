Song Name: Are You Gonna Be My Girl
Go
So one, two, three, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine
I say you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine
Oh, four, five, six, c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need the money
When you look like that do you honey
Big black boots
Long brown hair
She's so sweet with her
Get back stare
Well I could see
You home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
I said, are you gonna be my girl
Well it's one, two, three, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine
I say you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine
Oh four, five, six, c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need the money
With a face like that do ya
Big black boots
Long brown hair
She's so sweet with her
Get back stare
Well I could see
You home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
I said, are you gonna be my girl
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
C'mon
I could see
You home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
Uh, be my girl
Be my girl
Are you gonna be my girl, yeah
