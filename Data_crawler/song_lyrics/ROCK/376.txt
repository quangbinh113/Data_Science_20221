Song Name: Narc
Sell you all out
I'll tell you my secret
Not enough love?
How bout a pick-me-up
Year of the rooster
Forever raw
Year of the rat
Baby I'm a narc for your love
Lean in close
I'll show you what you wanna see
I'm not pretty
I just know how to work the angles
Year of the rooster
Cock of the walk
Year of the rat
Baby I'm a narc for your love
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Coming home
Home
