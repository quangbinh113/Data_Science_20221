Song Name: WHY?
I don't wanna keep feeling alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just wanna, I just wanna stop asking myself why
I don't wanna keep being alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just gotta, I just gotta stop questioning my life
Don't know what's true
My mind's talking shit, throwing fits
All the layers peeling back for you
You knew I was scared, but you weren't there
Don't talk about it, talk about it
Can't grieve now for you, I'm focused
All you gave me was a hole in
My heart, now it's a scar
And you don't even care
And you don't even care
And you don't even care
And you don't even care
And you don't even care, no
I don't wanna keep feeling alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just wanna, I just wanna stop asking myself why
I don't wanna keep being alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just gotta, I just gotta stop questioning my life
There's no time for fight-or-flight (fight-or-flight)
Think I'm gonna freeze, no peace in my head
Instead, I'm faded, finding new heights (finding new heights)
Swaying with the trees, angels speak to heal the weakness
In my heart, I don't even know where to start or when to stop
I said, "No time for fight-or-flight"
I think I'm gonna freeze
And you don't even care
And you don't even care
And you don't even care, no
I don't wanna keep feeling alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just wanna, I just wanna stop asking myself why
I don't wanna keep being alone
Isolation got me going psycho
I just gotta, I just gotta stop questioning my life
