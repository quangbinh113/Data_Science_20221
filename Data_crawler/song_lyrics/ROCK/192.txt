Song Name: Baptize
Baptize!
I have seen what I've become
Close my eyes, hide from the sun
No breath to fill the air
Where do I go from here?
I've been living in darkness all my life
Beaten, broken, brutalized
Tell me, how do I make it out alive?
Wash away my sins, baptize!
Baptize!
Can't deny this anymore
Feelings leave me wanting more
My hope will lead me there
I'll fight to live again
I've been living in darkness all my life
Beaten, broken, brutalized
Tell me, how do I make it out alive?
Wash away my sins, baptize!
Baptize!
Baptize!
I've been living in darkness all my life
Beaten, broken, brutalized
Tell me, how do I make it out alive?
Wash away my sins, baptize!
Baptize!
Baptize!
