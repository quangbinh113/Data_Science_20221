Song Name: Thrown Down
He fell for her again
She watched it happen
Every day, day by day
But more important, night by night
She watched it all come into play

He held her hands
She listened to what he had to say
Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her

And they should be together
(Together, together, together, together)
You've shaken your faith in me, no
You've shaken the faith in everything else
A decision no one makes
And now you're going home
Faith is a hard thing to hold on to
Something inside you says I don't have to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to
Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her

And they should be together
(Together, together, together, together)

You say you're sorry
Now you should walk away
But it's so overwhelming
You have nothing left to say
You can sit outside his door and wait
Well, you can dedicate your pain to him
All thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her

That he could be good for her

And they should be together
(Together, together, together, together)
About just how much he never really told her
Thrown down
About how difficult it had been to be without her
Thrown down
