Song Name: Barracuda
So, this ain't the end, I saw you again, today
I had to turn my heart away
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails

You're lying so low into the weeds,
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, barracuda? Oh
Back over time we were all trying for free
You, and the porpoise, and me
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick,
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Oh, barracuda, oh, yeah
"Sell me, sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep, down deep within you
I think that you got the blues too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western fools, silly, silly fools
If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oh, barra-barra-cuda, yeah
Ooh, hey
