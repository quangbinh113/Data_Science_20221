Song Name: Too Much Monkey Business
Runnin' to and fro, hard workin' at the mill
Never failed in the mail, yet come a rotten bill
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Salesman talking to me tryin' to run me up a creek
Say, "You can buy it, go on, try it, you can pay me next week" ah
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Blonde-haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book, ha
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Same thing every day, gettin' up, goin' to school
No need to be complainin', my objections overruled, ah
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Payphone, somethin' wrong, dime gone, will mail
I ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale, ah
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
I been to Yokohama, been fightin' in the war
Army bunk, army chow, army clothes, army car, ah
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas, ah
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
I don't want your botheration, get away, leave me be
Too much monkey business for me
