Song Name: I've Just Seen A Face - Remastered 2009
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
I have never know the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out if sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Oh, fallin'
Yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
