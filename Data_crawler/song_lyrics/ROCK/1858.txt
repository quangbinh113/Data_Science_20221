Song Name: It Hurts Me Too - Live
Yeah i love you baby
Always treats you kind
Yet you still worry me out of my mind
When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
Its hurts me too
Ahh you better quit him or he better put you down
Cos i ain't gon stand to see you pushed around
When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
Its hurts me too
(Is that all right)
(You know i really don't chance on other people)
(It's the way it lead me)
(And its the redel)
