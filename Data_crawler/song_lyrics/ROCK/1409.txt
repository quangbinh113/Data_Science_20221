Song Name: Love Me Two Times
Love me two time, baby
Love me twice today
Love me two time, girl
I'm goin' away
Love me two time, girl
One for tomorrow, one just for today
Love me two times, I'm goin' away
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah, my knees got weak
Love me two time, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times, I'm goin' away
Love me two times, I'm goin' away
All right, yeah
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time, baby
Yeah, my knees got weak
Love me two time, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times, I'm goin' away
Love me two time, babe
Love me twice today
Love me two time, baby
'Cause I'm goin' away
Love me two time, girl
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times, I'm goin' away
Love me two times, I'm goin' away

Love me two times, I'm goin' away
