Song Name: By the Way
Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'll be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Overload
Steak-knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut
Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play
Dog town
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail
Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there
Waiting for
Black jack
Dope dick
Pawn shop
Quick pick
Kiss that dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story so I told one
Song bird
Main line
Cash back
Hard top
Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Of her soul
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there
Waiting for
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah
Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Of her soul
By the way I tried to say
I know you
From before
Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there
Waiting for
