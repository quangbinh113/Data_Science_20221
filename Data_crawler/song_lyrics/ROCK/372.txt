Song Name: Eclipse
We drove all night
So we could watch the eclipse
Your hand on my upper thigh
I read you directions off an old napkin
You said the sky looked like magic
And we kissed in the half-light
We found the perfect view off trail
It was the first time I had sex outside
But you don't know that I'm fucked up and
I'm not over my last love
I think I told you about him once
But maybe I played it off too much
It's always the same excuse and
I'll never say I love you
But I'll pretend that it's alright
We can just have a good time
And you brought me home
To your parents house
And we had to sneak around like kids
Making love downstairs on that little couch
I helped your mom set the table
And she laughed at things I said
And your dad asked me if I would be
Coming back again
But you don't know that I'm fucked up and
I'm not over my last love
I think I told you about him once
But maybe I played it off too much
It's always the same excuse and
I'll never say I love you
But I'll pretend that it's alright
We can just have a good time
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know that I'm fucked up
But you don't know that I'm fucked up and
I'm not over my last love
I think I told you about him once
But maybe I played it off too much
It's always the same excuse and
I'll never say I love you
But I'll pretend that it's alright
We can just have a good time
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know that I'm fucked up
