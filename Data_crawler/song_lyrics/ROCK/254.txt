Song Name: High on Me
(Are you high?)
Blonde hair, blue eyes
Couldn't color your lies
You're so fucking black and white
Whisper to a scream
Candy or the codeine
Try and get your story right
Are you high on the pills you take
Or the crimes of our yesterdays?
Are you high on the make believe or
Are you high on me?
Are you high on me?
Mother taught me
Give her black coffee
See what spills from her mouth
Three ring circus
Rising to the surface
Who's the lion, who's the clown? (Who's the clown?)
Are you high on the pills you take
Or the crimes of our yesterdays?
Are you high on the make believe or
Are you high on me?
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh
On the cocaine kiss
On the bedroom bliss
All the cash we burned
Yeah, we lived, but we never really learned
(Now I see)
(I don't know)
(How far you'll go)
Are you high on the pills you take
Or the crimes of our yesterdays?
Are you high on the make believe or
Are you high on me?
Tell me are you high on me?
Tell me are you high on me?
