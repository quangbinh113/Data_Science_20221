Song Name: Demon Fire
He loves to drive 'em crazy with his evil lips
Great guns are blazing, what a deadly trip
Yeah, born of no family, born of no creed
Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed
You better look around
Before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel, life's all crime

Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down
Demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
Get closer, fire
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Seeking all power, gonna hunt you down
Follow along on the flash, gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear that evil sound
Give me no quarter, all drenched in grime, huh
With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down
Demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
Get closer, fire
Demon fire
Flames burn higher
Demon fire
It's an all-out hellfire
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
It glows sapphire
Demon fire
Flames burn higher
Demon fire
It's an all-out hellfire

Fire, demon fire
Fire, demon fire
Demon fire
