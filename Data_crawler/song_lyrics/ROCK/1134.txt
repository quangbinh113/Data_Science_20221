Song Name: Shining Of Your Soul
In the backyard of my soul
There's a tiny little hole
And that's where all the trouble goes
Where all the trouble goes
In the center of my heart
There's a place that keeps you warm
That's where all my loving goes
Where all my loving goes
Love has a meaning
A true lovin' feeling
How can I be sure?
I can't stop believing
It's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining of your soul
In the backyard of my soul
Li–µs the answer to it all
It's a long, long way to go
Such a long, long way to go
Love has a meaning
A true lovin' feeling
How can I be sure?
I can't stop believing
It's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining
I see the shining of your soul
(Shining, shining of your soul) shining of your soul
(Shining, shining of your soul) shining of your soul
See the shining of your soul (shining of your soul)
(Shining, shining of your soul) shining of your soul
(Shining of your soul) shining, shining
(Shining, shining of your soul) shining of your soul
See the shining of your soul (shining of your soul)
Love has a meaning
A true lovin' feeling
How can I be sure?
I can't stop believing
It's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining of your soul
You shine, shine, shine
You shine, shine, shine
When you come through the door, oh
I see the shining of your soul
Of your soul
