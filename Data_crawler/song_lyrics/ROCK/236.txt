Song Name: Epitome
Out of an observation through the undead nation
(And that's not why it's fine)
Should I believe in things I've never thought is right
Another opening, his burning drink turn sour
If I could see your chi, I hate goodbyes, hi
If it is okay enjoy your life as a boy
(My ink is pink)
And I ensure you will if it's time I'm to feel
And if you touch the sky, your feet hand glide on upside
Just when it seems to cease, forever like this, so why?
End of this world wild now, child
Never do reason, oh
Recuperating, maybe
Shower at demise's house
I stay awake all night, as long as I am me, hey
Bury a cheese of mice, oh wiggle in ice, for hire
Oh, high, ho
The sun and me sit quietly in love
I wanna lay out, all sides
