Song Name: Young Lust
I am just a new boy, stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty gal
Will some woman in this desert land make me feel like a real man, take this rock and roll refugee?
Oooh, babe, set me free
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty gal
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty gal
Hello? This is a call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd. Will you accept the charges from United States?
Oh, he hung up. That's your residence? I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?
Hello? This is United States calling. Are we reaching?
See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering
