Song Name: Line It Up (feat. LP)
I'm feeling like a stranger 'cause I'm stuck here
Living like my parents is my worst fear
They had some kids and got lost in the suburbs
Working jobs they hated made them suffer
I'd rather die
Than live my fathers life
And pretend like I'm satisfied
So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
I'm diving off the edge
Crashing in these secondhand motel rooms
Driving 'cross the country 'cause I want to
I can't slow down because I'm scared to stand still
I can't go home because it feels like hell
And I'd rather die
Than live my fathers life
And pretend like I'm satisfied
So Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
I'm diving off the edge
Why should I come back to earth
When all that's there is tears and hurt?
There's absolutely nothing there for me (for me)
Diving off the edge feels good
I'm finally not misunderstood
I know that there is no way I can stay
I'd rather die than ever live my life that way
I'd rather die than ever live my life that way
Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line It Up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
I'm diving off the edge
I'm diving off the edge
I'm diving off the edge
