Song Name: Nothing To Lose
You've got me running and I don't know why
But nothing's gonna break my stride
And I find myself walking the line
But I just can't seem to make things right
I gotta give it to you, you won't stop
When you've got something to prove
I gotta give it to you, don't give up
When I've got nothing to lose
So I get high
You get low
Oh I get high
When I've got nothing to lose
When I've got nothing to lose
Well it might not seem like it now
But everything will get worked out somehow
And each step I take along that line
I just don't know what I'm gonna find
I gotta give it to you, you won't stop
When you've got something to prove
I gotta give it to you, don't give up
When I've got nothing to lose
So I get high
You get low
Oh I get high
When I've got nothing to lose
When I've got nothing to lose
Oh, you better run rabbit run
Oh, you better run rabbit run
So I get, high
You get low
Oh I get high
When I've got nothing to lose
When I've got nothing to lose
