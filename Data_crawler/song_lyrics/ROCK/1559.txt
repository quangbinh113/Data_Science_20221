Song Name: Needles and Pins - 2018 Remaster
I saw her today
I saw her face it was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray that they go away
Still it begins
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
Oh, I thought I was smart
I stole her heart
Didn't think I do but now I see
She's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see
Just how to say please
And get down on her knees
Oh, that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Oh no, oh no
Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong?
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong?
Because I saw her today
I saw her face, it was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray that they go away
Still it begins
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
Hey! Needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
