Song Name: Talking to Myself
Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on, but nobody's home
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go?
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you
And the truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself, talking to myself
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm just talking to myself
I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home?
Oh, all the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you
And the truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself, talking to myself
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm just talking to myself
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you
And the truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm just talking to myself
I'm talking to myself, I'm talking to myself
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, talking to myself
