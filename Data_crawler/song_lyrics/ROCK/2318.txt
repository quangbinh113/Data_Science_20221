Song Name: Cut - 1990 Demo
If only you'd never speak to me
The way that you do
If only you'd never speak like that
It's like listening to
A breaking heart, the falling sky
Fire go out and friendship die
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do
But you don't
You don't feel anymore
You don't care anymore
It's all gone, it's all gone
If only you'd never look at me
The way that you do
If only you'd never look like that
When I look at you
I see face like stone, eyes of ice
Mouth so sweetly telling lies
I wish you felt thе way that I still do
The way that I still do
But you don't
You don't feel anymore
You don't care anymore
It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone
Remembеr the way
That the dream could come true
Just push
It's all up to you
Just push
