Song Name: Where Eagles Dare - 2015 Remaster
It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on
But still they must fly
No one should go
Where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night
They fall through the sky
No one should fly
Where eagles dare
They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way
But maybe too late
They've got to try
To save the day
The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go
Where no one would to try
They chose to fly
Where eagles dare
