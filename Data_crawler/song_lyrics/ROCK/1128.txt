Song Name: We Built This House
Love is the glue
That hold us together
Faith and believing is the key
Is door of forever
Baby, you and I
Where every reason on Earth
To now and again it's always us
Against the world
Against the world
When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard
Like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
This house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
There is the time
To face stormy weather
But we are always standing strong
A lifetime together
Baby, you and I
We don't regret anything
And now it's the two of us again
Against the wind, against the wind
When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard
Like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
This house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
Brick by brick, we have set it up
Oh men, if this wall could talk
Bit by bit, based it on trust
We gave it all we got
When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard
Like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
This house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
We built this house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
We built this house on a rock
O-o-o-o-oh ...
