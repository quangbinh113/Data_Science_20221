Song Name: You Make Me Feel Like Itâ€™s Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
You got me checking my mirror
You make me feel like I'm on the run
Where'd you hide the gun?
The kitchen knife in your hand
Are you the poison? Are you the cure?
I'm not so sure
I'm shackled
There is no way out
I can't escape
When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
When you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
You cut me off from my friends
You cut me off from my family
I'm in misery (I'm your number one fan)
Each day I fall to my knees
I see the writing is on the wall
Now I'm in withdrawal
I'm shackled
There is no way out
I can't escape
When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
The way you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
When you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
I see your eye in the keyhole
I feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
Won't rest until I'm possessed
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
But you are the caretaker
