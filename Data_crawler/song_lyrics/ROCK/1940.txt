Song Name: Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)
Have you ever been (have you ever been)
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits, for you
So don't you be late
Oh, (I wanna show you), the different emotions
(I wanna run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride
We can cast all of your hang-ups over
The seaside
While we fly right over the love filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the love-land, soon you'll understand (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Make love, make love, make love, make love
I wanna show you
The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings
I wanna show you
Good and evil lay side by side while electric love penetrates the sky
I wanna show you
Lord, Lord, Lord I wanna show you
I wanna show you
Hmm-mm-mm
I wanna show you
Show you
I wanna show you (yeah)
