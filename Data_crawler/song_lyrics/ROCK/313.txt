Song Name: Butterflies
Lust
You played the strangest games
Under the bridge that day
Too young to understand
The places you put my hands
You laughed and turned away
But I remember it perfectly
'Cause tattooed on your spine
Was a million blue butterflies
There were butterflies
So jump
Off the bridge
Kiss the water
Kiss the water
Doves
Cooing in the park
Just as the world got dark
The moon behind a veil
The blood underneath my nails
I just can't shake the sin
There's something beneath my skin
And all you left behind
Was a million blue butterflies
There were butterlifes
So jump
Off the bridge
Kiss the water
Kiss the water
