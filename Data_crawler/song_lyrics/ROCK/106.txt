Song Name: Black Rhino
I see us crawling out
There's a light, at the end of the tunnel
Don't try and slow it down
Don't fear the end, they're in trouble
Hold your fist up to the sky
Show them we're alive
Survival, one chance
One life you never get it back
Black rhino, one left
Fight back or never see the end
We'll bring the world to life
Let's shine the light on the devil
They'll try to burn, us out
Then blame the fire on the rebel
Throw your fist into the sky
Show them we're alive
Survival, one chance
One life you never get it back
Black rhino, one left
Fight back or never see the end
Survival, survival, survival, yell!
I feel us crawling out
There's a light at the end, of the tunnel
You'll never shut us down
Here comes the end, you're in trouble
Survival, one chance
One life you never get it back
Black rhino, one left
Fight back or never see the end
Survival, one chance
One life you never get it, back
Black rhino, one left
Fight back or never see the end
Survival, survival, survival, yell!
