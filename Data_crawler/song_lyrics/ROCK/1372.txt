Song Name: Crosstown Traffic
You jump in front of my car when you, you know all time
That 90 miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a drive
You're just like (crosstown traffic!) so hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tyre tracks all across your back, I can, I can see you had your fun
But uh, darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red?
And with you, I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead
You're just like (crosstown traffic) so hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to run over you!
(Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down
And I've got better things on the other side of town
Yeah, girl (crosstown traffic)
Look out
Look out, baby, comin' through
(Crosstown traffic,) yeah, girl now
(Crosstown traffic) Look out, look out, baby
(Crosstown traffic, yeah, look out)
What's that in the street? Move over
(Crosstown traffic, yeah, look out)
