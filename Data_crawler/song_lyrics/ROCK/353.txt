Song Name: Phenomenal
Feel my body heat temperature rising
These emotions they're feeling surprising
Don't know why but now I fantasize
I'm trying to be good
I've been studying & summarizing
Philosphicating on every time I
Tried to fake it & play it so nice
Done doing what I should
Don't need nothing from you never a thing
Forget the wedding you can keep the gold ring
Just come here baby we can vibe in our thing
Ah ah
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal baby
Never knew you'd be leaving me floating
Felt a shiver now we're overflowing
So good to light up in your smoke
And I feel electrified
Don't need nothing from you never a thing
Forget the wedding you can keep the gold ring
Just come here baby we can vibe in our thing
Ah ah
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
We can do it like we're animals
Keeping me up all night on my toes
Feel the body high it's in your bones
You're phenomenal
You're phenomenal
Baby
