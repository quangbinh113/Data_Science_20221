Song Name: Danny Says - 2002 Remaster
Danny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfin' 'cause it's 20 below
Sound checks at 5: 02
The record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
Baby, oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go
And it, it may sound funny, but it's true
Hangin' out in 100 B, watching Get Smart on TV
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me
Hangin' out in L.A. and there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radio
Oh-ho oh-ho
Sound checks at 5: 02
The record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
Baby, oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go
And it, it may sound funny, but it's true
Hangin' out in 100 B, watching Get Smart on TV
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me
