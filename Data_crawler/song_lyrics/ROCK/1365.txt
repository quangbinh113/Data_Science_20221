Song Name: I Saw Her Standing There - Remastered 2009
One, two, three, four
Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another?
Oh, when I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Woo, when I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand
In mine
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Woo, since I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand
In mine
We danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
