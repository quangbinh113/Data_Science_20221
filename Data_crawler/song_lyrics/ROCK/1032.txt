Song Name: Dirty Livin'
I can't get enough of what I need
People all around me lettin' me bleed
Waitin' for the darkness to blind the heat
I make my livin' out on the streets
Dirty livin'
Dirty livin'
I can't wait any longer
To set myself free
Flashin' lights keep runnin' through my brain
Someone find the doctor to ease all the pain
Traffic in the city is burnin' me out
She makes me wanna jump up and shout
Dirty livin'
Dirty livin'
I can't wait any longer
To set myself free
I can't wait any longer
To set myself free
Not no more, no more
I gotta get away
Dirty livin', dirty livin'
Dirty livin'
Mainline out of China is due in tonight
Mother, sister, brother are lyin' uptight
I can hear the jukebox poundin' out loud
I take my fury out on the crowd
Dirty livin'
Dirty livin'
I can't wait any longer
To set myself free
I can't wait any longer
To set myself free
Not no more, no
I gotta get away
Dirty livin', dirty livin'
It's gettin' to me, it's gettin' to me
I can't wait, I can't wait
Dirty livin', dirty livin', yeah
Why don't you set me free?
