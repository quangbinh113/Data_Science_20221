Song Name: All I Got Is You
Oh, yeah
I see the way you roll your eyes
The way you purse your lips
Throw your stuff into a suitcase
Put your hands upon your hips
I'm not moved by your evil glare.
The way you toss your hair
You make stupid accusations
By which time I've lost the thread
Sometimes I wonder how it is you get
To piss me off this much
I may be heavier handed
And I like the tender touch
You moan and groan about me staying out
And drinking with the guys
I bet I bring them home try this one for size
Something awfully wrong with this deal babe
Any fool could see it's true
Can't you understand how I feel babe
You got me, but all I got is you
I guess I just don't have it in me,
To keep you satisfied
To be honest with you babe,
I'm only in it for the ride
And you may never bring yourself to take me as I am
But in case you hadn't noticed
I don't give a fucking damn!
