Song Name: King of Dreams
It doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong
It really doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't matter if you like my song
As long as you can hear me sing
'Cause I'm the thorn in every little girl's rose
You know I cut, but never bleed
A shadow in the night, pure delight
I can satisfy your every need
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm a fantasy man
Master of illusion, magic touch in my hand
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar of love, second hand hero
King of dreams
Don't make a difference what you got
It doesn't matter what you lose
Don't make a difference if you like it or not
Baby, I'm gonna change your attitude
'Cause all around me there is mystery and wonder
Now, can't you see it in my eyes?
I'll crack the sky, make you feel the thunder
You'll never see through my disguise
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm a fantasy man
Master of illusion, with my sleight of hand
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar for love, second hand hero
King of dreams
All around, all around
Emotional squeeze through
Again and again
I know just how to please you
Now, your mind is on the bend
Can't you feel the power?
Surrender in my arms
Beyond the witching hour
We're traveling on and on
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm a fantasy man
Master of illusion, magic touch in my hand
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar of love, second hand hero
King of dreams
Real smooth dancer, fantasy man
Master of illusion, sleight of hand
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar for love
The king of dreams
