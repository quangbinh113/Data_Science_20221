Song Name: Time Should Wait
Still I wonder dear
Are you restless at the thought
Of what could be
All the picnics at the park
It's all in my head,
All the things that you said
There must be another,
Taking your time
Time doesn't wait for you
Or me
And I wonder dear, did my silence fill the hall,
Under your spell,
Electric alcohol
Our hour was there,
But we were too scared
There must be another,
Taking your time
Time doesn't wait for you
Or me
There must be another,
Taking your time
Time doesn't wait for you
Or me
Time should wait for you
And me
