Song Name: Becoming
Every morning is
A new day where we're born again
And becoming
The center of the bliss
Laughing at the past
The skin is shredded in the back
And becoming
The pieces of a mask
And with the Devil's exit, oh, baby
The flames went higher and higher
Now finding peace and in Zen
And watching the flames go higher and higher
Silence is the best
Reply to a fool, remember that
And you're not falling
But just the better man
And with the Devil's exit, oh, baby
The flames went higher and higher
Now finding peace and in Zen
And watching the flames go higher and higher
And with the Devil's exit, oh, baby
The flames went higher and higher
Now finding peace and in Zen
And watching the flames go higher and higher
And with the Devil's exit, oh, baby
The flames went higher and higher
Now finding peace and in Zen
And feeling the flames go higher and higher
