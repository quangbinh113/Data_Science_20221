Song Name: Just Pretend
I'm not afraid
Of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay
But I can try my best to just pretend
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
I know the pain
That you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day
Goes by where I don't think I feel the same
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
