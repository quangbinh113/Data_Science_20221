Song Name: Money For Nothing - Remastered 1996
I want my
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Baby, get a blister on your thumb
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We've got to move these refrigerators
We've got to move these colour TVs
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup
Yeah buddy, that's his own real hair
The little faggot got his own jet airplane
The little faggot, he's a millionaire
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We've got to move these refrigerators
We've got to move these colour TVs
Got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We've got to move these refrigerators
We've got to move these colour TVs (look at him)
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she come in stickin' in the camera
Man, we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We've got to move these refrigerators
We've got to move these colour TVs, lord
Listen here
Now, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
Chicks for free
Get your money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Oozin' money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Get your money for nothin'
Chicks for free
Money for nothin' (all that money for nothing)
Chicks for free
Get your money for nothin'
Get your chicks for free
Get your money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' (what's that?)
And your chicks for free (look at that, look at that)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money (for nothing)
Easy, easy chicks (for free)
Easy, easy money (for nothing)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
That ain't workin'
Money for nothing
Chicks for free
Money for nothing
Chicks for free
