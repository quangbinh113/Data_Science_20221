Song Name: The Boys Light Up - Remastered 2013
Let me tell you about my mountain home
Where all the ladies names are Joan

Where husbands work back late at night

Hopes are up for trousers down
With hostess on a business flight
Taxi in a Mercedes drive
I hope that driver's coming out alive
The garden is a dorsetted
That lady - she's so corseted
She's got 15 ways to lead that boy astray
He thinks he's one and only
But that lovely she's so lonely
She pumps him full of breakfast and she sends him on his way
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Silently she opens the drawer
Mother's little helper is coming out for more

Strategically positioned before the midday show
Her back is arched, those lips are parched
Repeated blow by blow
Later at the party all the MPs rave
About the hummers she's been giving
And the money that they save
To her it is skin lotion
For his promotion to
That flat in Surfer's Paradise with the ocean view

What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
