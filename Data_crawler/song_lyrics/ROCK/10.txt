Song Name: What Happens After You?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm sending out a signal
Waiting on a callback from you
Did I hear an echo?
Or am I livin' in Déjà vu?
Corrosion in the wires
Makes it hard for me to understand
Part of me is curious
And part of me is too afraid to ask
You are the only one I ever really loved
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We're zooming to the future
And there's no way to turn back the clock
I've been dependent on you
And now I'm all alone on this rock
Life is unfamiliar
Everything is written down in code
All I have is a memory
All I have is a memory (of a memory)
You are the only one I ever really loved
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Will I go crazy, sadistic, swinging 'round a big stick
Will I grow kinder when I see how fragile life is
My mind spins
What happens after (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
What happens after you?
What happens after you, you, you?
You are the only one I ever really loved
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
What happens after you?
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Will I go crazy, sadistic, swinging 'round a big stick
Will I go kinder when I see how fragile life is
My mind spins
What happens after (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
What happens after you?
