Song Name: Cretin Hop - 2017 Remaster
There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
You gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins
Cretin, cretin
Gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop doin' the cretin hop
Cretin, Cretin
One two three four cretins wanna hop some more
Four five six seven all good cretins go to Heaven
There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
You gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins
Cretin, cretin
Gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop doin' the cretin hop
Cretin, cretin
One two three four cretins wanna hop some more
Four five six seven all good cretins go to Heaven
(Hey)
