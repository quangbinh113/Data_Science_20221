Song Name: The Mirror
You think you're right but you're not at all
And you think you're tight but you're not at all
I think you're dumb when you act the part
And I think you're done with who you are
Cause you are not alive
You are just a lie
You are not alive
You are just a lie
I put the mirror on the bedroom wall
So you can look at how you're doing
I think you think there's nothing to me
But it's not my fault you see right through me
Cause you are not alive
You are just a lie
You are not alive
You are just a lie
