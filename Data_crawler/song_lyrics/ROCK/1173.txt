Song Name: All Around the World
It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I want to be
I don't believe in everything I see
You know I'm blind so why d'you disagree?
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay
'Cause all the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay
So whatcha gonna do when the walls come falling down?
You never move, you never make a sound
So where you gonna swim with the riches that you found?
You're lost at sea then I hope that you've drowned
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay
'Cause all the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na,na na naaa
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na,na na naaa
Naa-ah, naa-ah, na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
All around the world
Gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be okay
'Cause all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be ok
All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay
All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay
