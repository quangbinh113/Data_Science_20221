Song Name: Permanent Rebellion
Stare
Neither wait for your arrival
Chastise in the weight of your approval
Tongue-tied, never rest
Buried in your favourite dress
I don't want to be alone like this
Why don't you make it what you want it to be?
I don't want to be a victim here, another victim here
False alarm, defeat
The way I pick
The night fades
Apostles of deceit, and instant facts
The night shakes all around us
Everything starts to beat
I don't want to take the long way home
But I don't want to find another way
Don't need to know what your opinion is, your opinion
I don't want to be alone like this
Why don't you make it what you want it to be?
I don't want to be a victim here, another victim here
When I go
I'm out
Along the nightshade
Tongue-tied, in distress
Buried in your favourite dress
I don't want to stay shut
Sleeping through the operation
No one wants to be wrong
Long before the vaccination
