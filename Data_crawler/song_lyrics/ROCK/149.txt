Song Name: Waiting on You
I'll be gone soon
But I wouldn't hold my breath
It's a mindfuck
And it hasn't happened yet
I remember televising deep regret
To the whole world, it's better off when I forget
I learned a lesson
Second guessing my sanity
My first impression
Fell in love with a fantasy
Deal with depression
Prayed the devil was on a leash
But I could never be free
Waiting on you
Got lost in the darkness
And laid with alarmists
Who suffered the truth
Waiting on you
I found motivation
A cheaper replacement
For making a move
Waiting on you (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Waiting on you
Midday dream
And I waded through the tides of a basement
What a way to blur the lines
In a black-out
Silhouettes of paradise
Remind me I'm
Waiting on you
Got lost in the darkness
And laid with alarmists
Who suffered the truth
Waiting on you
I found motivation
A cheaper replacement
For making a move
Waiting on you (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Waiting on you (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Waiting on you
Blood-red sun
It won't be long
Keep calm
Don't back out
Pyramids of sacrifice
Remind me I'm
Waiting on you
Got lost in the darkness
And laid with alarmists
Who suffered the truth
Waiting on you
Got lost in the darkness
And laid with alarmists
Who suffered the truth
Waiting on you
I found motivation
A cheaper replacement
For making a move
Waiting on you (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Waiting on you (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Waiting on you
