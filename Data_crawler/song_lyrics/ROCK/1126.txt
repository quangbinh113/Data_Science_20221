Song Name: Peacemaker
We could turn another page
Keep the lions in the cage
The battlefield is bleeding red
Land of glory, monster dead
Into a world without frontiers
With no hate, regret or fears
We'll burn to ashes in a flash
If we don't change, we're gonna crash
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Bury the undertaker
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Black horses ride
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Bury the undertaker
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Love's next in line
The evil monster is still alive
Even after all this time
It's been written in the stars
Forever love, stop the war
A ray of light is shining down
Tomorrow's 'round the corner now
Now the future's in your hands
Do you remember? Yes, we can
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Is there a man alive
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Under the sun
Peacemaker, peacemaker
There ain't no paradise
Peacemaker, peacemaker
For anyone
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Bury the undertaker
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Black horses ride
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Bury the undertaker
Peacemaker, peacemaker
Love's next in line
It's next in line
