Song Name: Guiding Light
So if I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
Can I find enough patience in time?
Take a step back and rewind
Or stay, away
I decided to hide it and nobody knew
What I was going through
Forget it
You've said it for the longest time
I don't wanna hear anymore
So tell me who to trust
If I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that I should find my own way back to Iife
Maybe you're right
Admit it, we're finished
It's killing me that you're
Unwilling, to give in
To any of my flaws
Seamlessly, you're getting over me
So leave my open stitches, I'll be free
For the longest time
I was blindly swimming through a wave of rage
Torn inside, lost my mind
So go ahead and turn the page
If I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that I should find my own way back to life
Maybe you're right
Help me, I keep drowning, I need a saviour
Help me, I scream but no one ever hears my voice
Help me, I need to swim away from danger
You can guide me back to life
Tell me what we're waiting for
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Tell me what we're waiting for
I don't even know anymore
If I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that I should find my own way back to life
Maybe you're right
Help me, I keep drowning, I need a saviour
Help me, I scream but no one ever hears my voice
Help me, I need to swim away from danger
You can guide me back to life
