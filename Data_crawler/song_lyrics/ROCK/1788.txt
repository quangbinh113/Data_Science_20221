Song Name: New Kid in Town - 2013 Remaster
There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar
Great expectations everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new
Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down
You look in her eyes, the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after awhile, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Oh, Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you?
(A-a-h...) When you're not around...
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you

Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away, and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along
Where you been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
(A-a-h...) And he's holding her
And you're still around...

Oh, my-my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town...(Ah, ah, ah)
Ooh, ooh, Everybody's talking 'bout
The new kid in town (Ooh hoo)
(Ooh hoo) Everybody's walking like
The new kid in town (Ooh hoo)
There's a new kid in town, I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town, I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid
