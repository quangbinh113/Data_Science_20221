Song Name: Moonlighting (Theme) - 2009 Remaster
Don't You Change
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Nothing could change you
Set and sure of the way
Charming and Bright
Laughing and gay
I'm Just a stranger
Love the Blues and the Braves
There is the sun and moon
They sing their own sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Some think it's sweeter
When you meet along the way
Come walk by night
Come fly by day
Some thing is sweeter
Cause we met along the way
We'll walk by night
We'll fly by day
Moonlighting strangers
Who just met on the way
Who just met on the way
Who just met on the way
