Hmm?
You know we finally here, right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then
Then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again, 'ain, 'ain', 'ain (what?)
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out
I'm countin' down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend)
It's Friday again (oh)
Then Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend)
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
Go, jump!

Hmm, their lives again
Their lives, to pull us, mm
Their lives again, 'ain, 'ain, 'ain
This could be bad for me 'cause I want more
Wanna feel the bass vibrating through the floor
So keep it playing, I'm on a wave
And I'ma ride it all the way
When it comes like
We want that weekend (again, again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
('Gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
Again, 'gain (again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
('Gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
We want that weekend (again, again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
('Gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
Again, 'gain (again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain)
Hey, we want that weekend
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again (go!)
Then Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend)
It's Friday again
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again (go!) 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend on a wave
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend on a wave
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
