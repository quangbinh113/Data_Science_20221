Song Name: Pieces - with VIZE & Leony
I'll be falling down
You'll be watching by my side
By my side
I just need a helping hand
I just need you in my life
In my life
Clouds keep turning black
Baby, please just call me back
You keep living in my mind
Feel your soul inside, yeah, inside
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Clouds keep turning black
Baby, please just call me back
You keep living in my mind
Feel your soul inside, yeah, inside
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
Falling into pieces, I'm so alone
I'm so alone
