Song Name: Don't Hurt Me (What Is Love)
What is love?
I can see your face in the most crowded room (crowded room)
You can make me feel like it is just us two (just us two)
It's like I'm running, running out of my breath
But I'm standing still
Your touch is shooting right through my chest
How can these be real?
I know that I would be dropping dead if your looks could kill
And your looks can kill
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
Don't hurt me, no more
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
You can make me feel like it is just us two (just us two)
It's like I'm running, running out of my breath
But I'm standing still
Your touch is shooting right through my chest
How can these be real?
I know that I would be dropping dead, if your looks could kill
And your looks can kill
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
Don't hurt me, no more
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
