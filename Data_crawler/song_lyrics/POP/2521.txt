Song Name: BREAK MY SOUL
I'm 'bout to explode, take off this load
Bend it, bust it open, won't ya make it go?
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka (release ya wiggle)
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka (release ya wiggle)
Ah, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
I'm telling everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Now, I just fell in love, and I just quit my job
I'm gonna find new drive, damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine, then off past five
And they work my nerves, that's why I cannot sleep at night
Motivation
I'm looking for a new foundation, yeah
And I'm on that new vibration
I'm building my own foundation, yeah
Hol' up, oh, baby, baby
You won't break my soul (na, na)
You won't break my soul (no-no, na, na)
You won't break my soul (no-no, na, na)
You won't break my soul (na, na)
I'm telling everybody, na, na, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Release ya anger, release ya mind
Release ya job, release the time
Release ya trade, release the stress
Release the love, forget the rest
I'ma let down my hair 'cause I lost my mind
Bey is back and I'm sleeping real good at night
The queens in the front and the Doms in the back
Ain't taking no flicks, but the whole clique snapped
There's a whole lot of people in the house
Trying to smoke with the 'gnac in your mouth
(Good at night) and we back outside
You said you outside, but you ain't that outside
Worldwide, hoodie with the mask outside
In case you forgot how we act outside
Got motivation (motivation)
I done found me a new foundation, yeah (new foundation)
Shaking my new salvation (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, new salvation)
And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, baby
You won't break my soul (you won't)
You won't break my soul (break my soul)
You won't break my soul (you won't)
You won't break my soul (break my soul)
And I'm telling everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody, yeah
You don't seek it, you won't see it
That, we all know (can't break my soul)
If you don't think it, you won't be it
That love ain't yours (can't break my soul)
Trying to fake it, never makes it
That, we all know (can't break my soul)
You can have the stress and not take less
I'll justify love
We go 'round in circles, 'round in circles
Searching for love ('round in circles)
We go up and down, lost and found
Searching for love
Looking for something that lives inside me
Looking for something that lives inside me
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
I'm telling everybody, telling everybody
Everybody, everybody
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul, no, no
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
And I'm telling everybody (oh yeah, yeah)
Everybody (oh yeah, yeah)
Everybody
Everybody (oh yeah, yeah)
I'm taking my new salvation
And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah
Got motivation (motivation)
I done found me a new foundation, yeah (new foundation)
I'm taking my new salvation (new salvation)
And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah (own foundation)
I'm 'bout to explode, take off this load
Bend it, bust it open, won't ya make it go?
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka (release ya wiggle)
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka
Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka (release ya wiggle)
Release ya, release ya
Release ya wiggle
Release ya anger, release ya mind
Release ya job, release the time
Release ya trade, release the stress
Release the love, forget the rest
