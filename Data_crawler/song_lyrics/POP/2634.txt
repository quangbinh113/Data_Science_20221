Song Name: Love Me More
Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health?
Every day I'm tryin' not to hate myself
But lately, it's not hurtin' like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more
It used to burn
Every insult, every word
But it helped me learn (yeah)
Self-worth I had to earn
So I tried every night
To sit with sorrow
And eventually, it set me free
Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health?
Every day I'm tryin' not to hate myself
But lately, it's not hurtin' like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more
Just a little bit (love me more)
Just a little bit (love me more)
Oh, no (love me more)
Just a little bit (love me more)
I used to cry myself to sleep at night
I'd blame the sky when the mess was in my mind
I couldn't see, I couldn't breathe
So I sat with sorrow
And eventually, it set me free
Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health?
(If you have, let me hear you right now)
Every day I'm tryin' not to hate myself (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But lately, it's not hurtin' like it did before (sweet child)
Maybe I am learning how to love me more
Just a little bit (love me more)
Just a little bit (love me more)
Oh, I'm gonna try to (love me more)
With a little bit of love (love me more)
Love me more
Love me more (just a little bit)
Love me more (love me more)
Love me more
Oh, gonna love me more (gonna love me more)
Oh, gonna love me more (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, gonna love me more (gonna love me more)
(Oh) oh, gonna love me more
