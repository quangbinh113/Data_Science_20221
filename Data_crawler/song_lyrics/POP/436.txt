Song Name: It Ain't Me - TiÃ«sto's AFTR:HRS Remix
It ain't me
It ain't me
It ain't me
I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor of The Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you've been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the Sun won't let you sleep?
It ain't me
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and the liberties
Never growing up
I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the Sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home?
When you're drunk and all alone
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
It ain't me!
