Song Name: Horizon (feat. Leon Bridges)
The first night I sat and told
I realized, I realized
That I wasn't tryna fall for you
Those big brown eyes, big brown eyes
If I said it meant nothing to me, I'd
I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin'
I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin'
If you hurtin', if you searchin'
I'll be right here, where you left me
I'm just over the horizon
I'll be right here, where you left me
If you hurtin', if you searchin'
I'll be right here, where you left me
Wherе you left me, wherе you left me
Where you left me, oh
Where you left me, where you left me
Where you left me, oh
You and me, yeah, I'll be fine
We need space, we need time
Woah
If I said it meant nothing to me, I'd, I'd
I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin'
I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin'
If you hurtin', if you searchin'
I'll be right here, where you left me
I'm just over the horizon
I'll be right here, where you left me
If you hurtin', if you searchin'
I'll be right here, where you left me
I'm just over the horizon
I'll be right here, where you left me
Where you left me, where you left me
Where you left me, oh
Where you left me, where you left me
Where you left me, oh
