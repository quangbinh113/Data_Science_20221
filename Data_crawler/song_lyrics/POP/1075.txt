Song Name: Elon Musk (feat. Gunna)
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a recipe, cook it up
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
We just fuck, but I can't say it, but she still my crush
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Elon Musk, like I'm Elon Musk
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
Hit the blunt and I'm stuck, hey
I don't give no fucks, hey
Float away, I took a Perky, I'm geekin'
Still goin' up and all these niggas is peakin'
Book a private jet and fly out the region
Put a hundred on the dash in the demon
I know she gon' stick around for a reason
She know she can get a bag off the semen
Back to back Maybachs, me and Gunna on a double date, slatt
I'm too real, I can't cap, I'on gotta lie, I only state facts
We know you not a killa, you is not that nigga
You just got a face tat
I'm smoking on Gorilla in a chinchilla, Maybach seat lay flat
Flyin' through the 101, I did the race, yeah
I just hit my blunt, I feel like I'm in space, yeah
No more savin' hoes, I just returned my cape, yeah
I just want a billion like Elon and Ye
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
We just fuck but I can't say it, but she still my crush
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Elon Musk, like I'm Elon Musk
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
Come to my crib, everything like a museum, please don't touch
Took a Tesla pill, and it start to make me feel like Elon Musk
I'm Gunna, I showed you real deal, yeah, that's on us
You ain't gotta pinch me, I know you real, sure it ain't no luck
Bracelet on my wrist not the cuffs, gotta Richard and Dippity Duck
I done found some mo' ways to make money
I been pushin' that P and it stuck
I know niggas thought it would be over
But we steady comin' and not lettin' up
(I know niggas thought it would be over
But we steady comin' and not lettin' up)
Whole lotta money calling my name, I don't know who to trust
It's a whole lotta dummies on that truck, he ain't no plug (slime)
The difference between me and yo' man is he's a scrub (scrub)
White mink in that Phantom Rolls-Royce, same color a dove
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
We just fuck, but I can't say it, but she still my crush
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Elon Musk, like I'm Elon Musk
This smoke gon' take me straight to space like I'm Elon Musk
Whole lotta money in this safe, don't worry about us
I got a bad bitch in my place, she don't care if I touch
