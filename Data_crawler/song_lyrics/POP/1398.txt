Song Name: Good Days
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let your edge out
Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind
Can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch
While the world break up and fall on me
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in (good days), good days, always
Always inside
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear, if you let me
Feelin' like (on your own), feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit getting good with it babe
Baby, heavy on my empty mind shit
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent" (urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (my mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me
Choose to watch
While the world break up and fall on me
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in (good days), good days, always
Sunny inside
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present right now
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
