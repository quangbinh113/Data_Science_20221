Song Name: In My Place
In My Place, In My Place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it
If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me
Come back and sing
In My Place, In My Place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah
