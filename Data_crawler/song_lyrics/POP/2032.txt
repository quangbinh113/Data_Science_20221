Song Name: Rich Flex
Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten nigga to get in, we crunk, lit in this bitch, yeah
(Body up, yuh, yuh)
Know we walk around the world
(Body up, yuh, yuh)
Steppin' not givin' a damn 'bout where our feet land at
Yeah, get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy
21, can you do some' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do sum' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex to me
And 21 (21), can you do some' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing, 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing
Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than a plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty and magic (21)
I'd slap a pussy nigga with the ratchet (pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get to addin' (pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my L, your hoe a freak (fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got-
All you hoes
All of you hoes need to remember who y'all talking to
It's the slaughter gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not working, girl
If I'm busy, then, fuck no!
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low
You need to find you someone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that slaughter gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, slaughter gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies clickin' up so they don't feel alone
Ayy, man, nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PnB
I'm steady pushing P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when world was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like the DMC
I later wait a full couple days, then it's "brb"
You rappers like askin' if I fucked when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels, but she left out on a cozy shit
Ayy, I'm living every 24 like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is getting ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from 12, but I don't reciprocate
51 division, stay patroling, when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eating off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
(Slaughter gang shit, ayy murder gang shit, ayy)
(Slaughter gang shit, ayy murder gang shit, ayy)
(Slaughter gang shit, ayy murder gang shit, and you got 'em)

Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man
Boy, you, ooh, you is the man, yeah, man!
