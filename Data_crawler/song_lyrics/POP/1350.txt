Song Name: Sugar (feat. Francesco Yates)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby
Ooh, ooh, hey
She got cherry lips
Angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised
Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Ooh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Ooh, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Ooh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Ooh, sweet-talkin' lady
Love how you entice
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you
You can't run, you can't hide
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do things twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised
Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
So fly
Ooh, hey
Oh, babe
Yeah, hey
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Ooh, sugar how you get so fly?
Said, sugar, sugar how you get so fly?
But you won't get me tonight
Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby it's the ultimate feeling (Ultimate feeling)
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
Sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
Sugar, how you get so fly? (Hey)
