Song Name: Bitter Sweet Symphony
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life

Tryin' to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down

You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)
Well, I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now

But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)
I can't change it you know
I can't change it
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
Tryin' to make ends meet, tryin' to find some money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
You know, I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
It's just I can't change my violence, melody and violence
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down (sex and violence, melody and silence)
It's just I can't change my violence, melody and silence
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down (sex and violence, melody and silence)
Been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
