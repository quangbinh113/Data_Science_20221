Song Name: You Make Me Feel
I couldn't even if I tried
All I hear is this voice inside of me
But I do my best to hide it
And I pray that it is temporarily
I've been lost for so long
But you make me feel
That I am on to something true, something real
You make me believe, you make me feel again
Left behind back at the station
Suddenly there's no one else but me around
I lost my thought in translation
Oh, if I can only bring this back around
I've been lost for so long
But you make me feel
That I am on to something true, something real
You make me believe, and when I need it the most
When there are clouds over me
With insecurity
You'd be my Holy Ghost
'Cause you make me feel
That I am on to something true, something real
You make me believe, you make me feel again
Make me believe, you make me feel again
You make me believe, you make me feel again
