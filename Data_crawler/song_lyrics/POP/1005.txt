Song Name: Freeze
We out on the rooftop of your car, under the sky
I'll tell you the truth, crossing my heart, hopin' to die
I don't know nobody, like you know nobody
Hey, ooh-ah, ah, ah
I'm watchin' a star, a million light years away
I wish I could pause, and hit replay
Yeah, 'cause summers go so fast
Darlin', can we freeze?
Let me save this perfect memory
Remember how it feels, like flyin' in the dark
Like I must be awake inside a dream
Darlin', can we freeze?
'Cause even though you're right here nеxt to me
A part of me still feels like nothin' еver lasts
Like I'm already missin' you and me
Oh-oh, can we freeze?
Darlin', can we freeze?
Oh-oh, can we freeze?
Darlin', can we freeze?
Oh-oh, can we free-
Why am I like this? Why does my mind go racin'?
This beautiful silence, but I feel like I'm always waitin'
Like it's just a matter of time 'til it shatters
Darlin', can we freeze?
Let me save this perfect memory
Remember how it feels, like flyin' in the dark
Like I must be awake inside a dream
Darlin', can we freeze?
'Cause even though you're right here next to me
A part of me still feels like nothin' ever lasts
Like I'm already missin' you and me
Oh-oh, can we freeze?
Oh-oh, can we freeze?
Darlin', can we freeze?
Darlin', can we freeze?
Can we free-
