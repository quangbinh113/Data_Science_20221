Song Name: you were good to me
Lying, isn't better than silence
Floating, but I feel like I'm dying
Still no matter where I go
At the end of every road
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
I know it's easier to run
After everything I've done
You were good to me
You were good to me
You were good to me
You were good to me
Leaving, isn't better than trying
Growing, but I'm just growing tired
Now I'm worried for my soul
And I'm still scared of growing old
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
And I'm so used to letting go
But I don't wanna be alone
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah, oh
God only knows, where our fears go
Hearts I've broke, now my tears flow
You'll see, that I'm sorry
'Cause you were good to me
You were good to me
And now I'm closing every door
'Cause I'm sick of wanting more
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
Swear I'm different than before
I won't hurt you anymore
'Cause you were good to me
