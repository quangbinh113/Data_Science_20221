Song Name: Someone Like You (feat. Joy Oladokun)
Guess I'm a mess now
Lost with my head down
I haven't heard from you in weeks
You must've left town
I can't go back now
And all that I have now
Are those feelings I felt
Knowing that no one else can bring them back out
And I've been trying
To find a silver lining but I can't
But I can't
Now that I can't hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can't find you
Because the second you left yeah
The voice in my head screamed, "What did I do?"
Now you're gone and all I want is someone like you
Someone like you (someone like you)
Somеone like you (someonе like you)
It all makes sense now
But I can't repent now
Because I'm stuck like a grave in the space that you left
With no reason to get out
And I've been trying
To find a silver lining but I can't
No, I can't
Now that I can't hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can't find you (now that I can't find you)
Because the second you left, yeah
The voice in my head screamed, "What did I do?" (what did I do?)
Now you're gone and all I want is someone like you
Someone like you (someone like you)
Someone like you (someone like you)
And I've been trying
To find a silver lining but I can't
Now that I can't hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can't find you (now that I can't find you)
Because the second you left, yeah
The voice in my head screamed, "What did I do?" (what did I do?)
Now you're gone and all I want is someone like you
Someone like you (someone like you)
Someone like you (someone like you)
Someone like you (someone like you)
Now you're gone and all I want is someone like you
