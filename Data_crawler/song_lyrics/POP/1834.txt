Song Name: You'll Be In My Heart - Spotify Singles
Come stop the crying, it'll be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here, don't you cry
For one so small, you seem so strong
My arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm
This bond between us can't be broken
I will be here, don't you cry
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now, and forevermore
Yes, you'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart always
Why can't they understand the way we feel?
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all (we're not that different at all)
And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now, and forevermore
Don't listen to them, 'cause what do they know?
We need each other, to have and to hold
They'll see in time (they'll see in time), I know
When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you, but you've got to hold on
They'll see in time (they'll see in time), I know
We'll show them together
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now, and forevermore
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart always
Always
Just look over your shoulder (I'll be with you)
Just look over your shoulder (I'll be there for you always)
(Always and always) just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there always
