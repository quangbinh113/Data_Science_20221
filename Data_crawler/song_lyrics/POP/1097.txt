Song Name: Undeniable (feat. X Ambassadors)
Lied to myself, but I
Don't believe a word and I
Tried to sabotage it, but
But when you're gone, it hurts, and I
I used to get cold feet
I'd never go too deep
I was scared of the sound of a heartbeat
But it's undeniable
What I feel for you
You know I've been wrong before
But you're undeniable, oh, whoa-oh
But it's undeniable
But you're undeniable
You pull me in, and I push you away (push you away)
It's 'cause I'm so paranoid, I got PTSD (PTSD)
Yeah, I used to get cold feet
I'd never go too deep (never go so deep)
I was scared of the sound of a heartbeat
But it's undeniable (oh, baby)
What I feel for you (everything I feel for you)
You know I've been wrong before (so many times, so many times, yeah)
But you're undeniable (yeah), oh, whoa-oh (ayy)
But it's undeniable
But you're undeniable
But it's undeniable
What I feel for you
You know I've been wrong before
But you're undeniable
It's undeniable
