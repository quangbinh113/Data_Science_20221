Song Name: Blessed & Free
I've been on the highway for two days
Tryna keep my head straight
Running from my old ways, the old days
It was dust and dreams
I've been sippin' Moonshine for two nights
Tryna keep the moonlight
Rebel with a lost cause and there's no time to sleep
'Cause as long as my eyes still see
As long as my heart still beats
As long as I'm alive, I'm free
So I don't count on nothing
Don't ever stop running
I ain't hurting nobody, so just let me be
I got good intentions, I don't need your blessings
Yeah, I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm already blessed and free (blessed and free)
Yeah, I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm alrеady blessed and free
I just need to drive slow, еyes closed
Or travel where my mind goes
I'm just tryna lay low, so don't mind me
Struggle with my own fights so don't try (don't try)
To tell me that it's alright
But nothin' but my own lows and my hopes beside me
Oh, oh
As long as my eyes still see
As long as my heart still beats
As long as I'm alive, I'm free
So I don't count on nothing
Don't ever stop running
I ain't hurting nobody, so just let me be
I got good intentions, I don't need your blessings
'Cause I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm already blessed and free (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm already blessed and free (oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause as long as my eyes still see
As long as my heart still beats
As long as I'm alive, I'm free
(So I don't)
So I don't count on nothing
Don't ever stop running
I ain't hurting nobody, so just let me be
I got good intentions, I don't need your blessings
Yeah, I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm already blessed and free (blessed and free)
Yeah, I'm already blessed, yeah, I'm already blessed and free (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm already
Blessed and free
