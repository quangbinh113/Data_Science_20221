Blow me like a flute, aye
Diamonds dripping they so wet

Got no time for mood swings
Spent like 50 on the ring and I bought two rings
Remember that bitch ain't want fuck me
Now that bitch wanna just fuck me
Remember that bitch said I'm dusty
Look at that hoe like you ugly
Aye, your man ain't got no money, aye

Skeme be smoking the clove
My brother whipping the stove
Jump in the crowd at my show
Fucked the bitch in the front row
First I drop my top, aye
Then I swerve my coupe, aye
Counting all these bands, aye

Why you walk so cool? Aye

Hotel party for these bad hoes
For these bad hoes that trip
