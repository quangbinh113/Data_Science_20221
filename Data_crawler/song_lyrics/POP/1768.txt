Song Name: ...And to Those I Love, Thanks for Sticking Around
Take me home, take me home
It's the one place I can rest in peace

Turn off my phone
So many messages I wish I could just delete
Questioning my existence ('istence)
Questioning my decisions ('cisions)
Burning down all the bridges (bridges)
Dig a moat, now I'm finished
Sorry, don't want you to visit, no
No
One last pic and I'll be gone
Make it count, put the flash on
Never really felt like I belonged
So I'll be on my way
And I won't be long (be long, be long)
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn (by dawn, by dawn, by dawn...)
Scrolling through my texts
Shit I left unread
Never trying to deal with it
There's bliss up in my ignorance
Ten dope dealers (dealers)
Ex want me to see her (see her)
Can't trust her, don't believe her
Reply turn into a needle, yeah
Don't wanna do it again (do it again)
Got shit I'm not trying to relive (to relive)
Head fucked up and I'm sick
These old habits will kill me quick
Quicker than I can blink (blink, blink, blink...)
Quicker than I can think (think, think, think...)
Lift me up, don't want to sink
Pour me up, I need a drink
What the fuck do I do when sabotage is all I know? Oh
I done dug myself my own grave in this hole, whoa
Kill me slow, slow
Curtains close low
Fuck, I don't see what's the point of going on
No (no, no, no, no, no, no...)
