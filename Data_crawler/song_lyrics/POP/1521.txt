Song Name: Kiss Me
If we could take a photo, eternalize this moment
For the days when I don't believe
When our love gets stolen 'cause there's no exception
And I know time will take you far from me
Let this night invade my lungs
You're all I wanna breathe
Right beside the lake
I burn for you, you burn for me
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight
All our deepest secrets, all the darkest moments
Oh, I promise they'll be safe with me
We've all been broken, there's no exception
But you carry it so gracefully
Let this night invade my lungs
You're all I want to breathe
Right beside the lake
I burn for you, you burn for me
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight, yeah

So I let this night in my lungs
You're all that I wanna breathe
Right beside you down at the lake
I'll burn for you, burn for me
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
And hold me the way that you would
For the final time, yeah
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight, yeah
If we die tonight, yeah
If we die tonight, yeah
