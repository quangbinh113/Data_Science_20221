Song Name: Next Best Thing
I like holding your hand
But it hurts, oh I can't stand
To see you
To feel you
My insides are turning blue
I like the way that you walk
Sometimes I wish you'd never stop
My heart aches
My bones break
With each little move you make
I can't help
I can't really help it
You make me feel like
You're waiting for the next best thing
(Something had to change)
A girl you'd give a diamond ring
(It's kind of hard to explain)
I'm not mad that you don't adore me
(Wish you told me)
But when I'm with you I feel lonely
Oh-oh-oh
I've been staring outside
Spare time, was thinking I could find
Where leaves blow
Where the weeks go
When the snow comes to dampen your fall
Far from the life that we knew
Months hurtle by and I barely see you
So I've been down
Dumb as it sounds
When you're with me you're somebody else
I can't help
I can't really help it
You make me feel like
You're waiting for the next best thing
(Something had to change)
A girl you'd give a diamond ring
(It's kind of hard to explain)
I'm not mad that you don't adore me
(Wish you told me)
But when I'm with you I feel lonely
Oh, you're waiting for the next best thing
(You're saying hi to your friends)
The table won't know what to bring
(Nice to see you again)
Your intentions are so damn hazy
(Though it pains me)
I wish you'd let your guard get lazy
Oh-oh-oh
