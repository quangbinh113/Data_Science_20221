Song Name: Lose You
Yeah, I've got regrets
But they'd never measure up to the heavy hole you'd leave
Oh, if you left
I know I'd spend my life just chasing memories
Tracing back our steps
Trying to find out when
When did never ends, turn into enemies
Lying in our beds
My head is miles ahead
I'm skipping to the end
Oh, I think I would lose my mind
If I would ever lose you
I'd leave my heart behind
If I would ever lose you
Nothing in my chest, just take it
All the breath in my lungs, just wasted
'Cause I think I would lose my mind
If I would ever lose you
If I would ever lose you
If I would ever lose you
I'd be alone in the gray
Lost in the daze of heartbreak, if I ever let you go
What can I say?
Without you, I'm just a shade of someone I used to know
Tracing back our steps
Trying to find out when
When did never ends, turn into enemies
Lying in our beds
My head is miles ahead
I'm skipping to the end
Oh, I think I would lose my mind
If I would ever lose you
I'd leave my heart behind
If I would ever lose you
Nothing in my chest, just take it
All the breath in my lungs, just wasted
'Cause I think I would lose my mind
If I would ever lose you
If I would ever lose you
If I would ever lose you (don't ever lose you)
If I would ever lose you (don't ever lose you)
If I would ever lose you
