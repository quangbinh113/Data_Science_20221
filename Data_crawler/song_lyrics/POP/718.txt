Song Name: Alone Together
All I really want to do
Is be myself in front of you
'Cuz they don't get it what we do
Can you be yourself in front of me too?
We're not lonely
It's not the thing I worry
If you're lonely
Then you got me
After all,
You can be anything you want
After all,
I can be anything I want
After all,
We can be anything we want
'Cuz now we're alone together
Alone, together
We're not lonely
It's not the thing I worry
If you're lonely then you got me
And here you are still with me
Being free and let it heal
We know we've got something they don't see
So, let it be
After all,
You can be anything you want
After all,
I can be anything I want
After all,
We can be anything we want
'Cuz now we're alone together
Alone, together
