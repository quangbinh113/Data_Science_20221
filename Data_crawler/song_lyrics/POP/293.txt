Song Name: Budapest
My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you
To stop and believe
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My many artefacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words
I'll, I'll up and run
Oh, to you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, ooh
I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My friends and family
They don't understand
They fear they'll lose so much
If you take my hand
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
