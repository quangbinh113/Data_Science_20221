Song Name: The Trouble With Love Is
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Mmm
Love can be a many splendored thing
Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool you every time
The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all, oh
Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name
The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all
Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps callin' and I keep on fallin'
Over and over again
This set story always ends the same
Me standin' in the pourin' rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two
The trouble with love is (The trouble with love)
It can tear you up inside (It can tear you up inside)
Make your heart believe a lie (Make your heart believe a lie)
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is (It's in your heart it's in your soul)
It doesn't care how fast you fall (You're losing all control)
And you can't refuse the call
See, you've got no say at all
The trouble with love is (Oh yeah, yeah)
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie (The trouble with love)
