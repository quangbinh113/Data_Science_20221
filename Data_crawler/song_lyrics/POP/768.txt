Song Name: Street Walkin'
The street was darker than the last time I held your hands
Something is aching on my heart
When I struggle with my mind, I fought for my self
Should I take an aspirin?
When I don't want to see my face in a mirror
Should I break all of them inside my world?
Would you like to write something in my mind or my heart?
Something that cannot be erased
And I should empty my mind and let it all out
Should I seek for the light?
And I feel sorry for what I wrote
And rewrite a better story or a better poetry
Can I have your love tonight
Can I have your smile tonight
Don't believe that what I said
If the moon can't be seen tonight
May I kiss you one more time
I will miss you every night from now
Can I have your love tonight
Can I have your smile tonight
Don't believe that what I said
If the moon can't be seen tonight
May I kiss you one more time
I will miss you every night from now
The night seems stealing all my mind if I hold your hands
Something that make me cannot breath
When I entered my mind, I found "other mine"
It's never so far away
When it take all of my mind, will I stay alive
In another world where it's just a "something"?
Can I have your love tonight
Can I have your smile tonight
Don't believe that what I said
If the moon can't be seen tonight
May I kiss you one more time
I will miss you every night from now
Can I have your love tonight
Can I have your smile tonight
Don't believe that what I said
If the moon can't be seen tonight
May I kiss you one more time
I will miss you every night from now
