Song Name: Silent
How long will you keep pretend to your lonely other self?
Do you think it's good for you?
How long can you keep standing in a place you don't belong?
Do you think it's good for you?
Heart, where you put everything you need
Don't you ever ever detach it
Put some efforts to keep it warm
Soul, when you tired and need to go home
Don't you ever ever darken it
Put more efforts to keep it bright
How much can you keep staring to that sky that seem so far?
Do you think it's close enough?
How can you still imagine to this world that seem so vast
Do you think it's narrow?
Heart, where you put everything you need
Don't you ever ever detach it
Put some efforts to keep it warm
Soul, when you tired and need to go home
Don't you ever ever darken it
Put more efforts to keep it bright
When the night make people beg for her light
When the sun gives a little of his light
When the sunrise so bright
When the sunrise so bright
