Song Name: All About That Bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Bass, bass, bass (bass)
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it
Like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom, boom
That all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines workin' that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
C'mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama, she told me, "Don't worry about your size"
(Shoo-wop-wop, sha-ooh-wop-wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
And, no, I won't be no stick-figure silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo-wop-wop, sha-ooh-wop-wop)
So if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
Nah, I'm just playing, I know y'all think you're fat
But I'm here to tell ya every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama, she told me, "Don't worry about your size"
(Shoo-wop-wop, sha-ooh-wop-wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
And, no, I won't be no stick-figure silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo-wop-wop, sha-ooh-wop-wop)
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I said I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I said I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I said I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I said I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
'Bout that bass, 'bout that bass, hey, hey
Hey, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh
You know you love this bass, ayy, haha
