Song Name: Back to Friends
Guess you were right to hide the way you feel
We'd keep pretending like it wasn't real
Said you need space and now I finally understand
Why you refused to take my hand
When you're in love, it's hard to hide the truth
I know you better than you think I do
Lookin' back, I see I should've held my tongue
But I was immature and young
I miss the uncertainty
And all the nights of losin' sleep
Just two kids and make-believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?
'Cause I'd die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met
Or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Fallin' in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to bein' friends?
Guess I'm the right person at the wrong time
I'm the type of crazy to ignore the signs
And now I see you got some shit to figure out
And that's the reason you can't love me now
I miss the uncertainty
And all the nights of losin' sleep
Just two kids and make-believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?
'Cause I'd die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met
Or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Fallin' in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to bein' friends?
Ooh, can we go back to bein' friends?
Ooh, can we go back to bein' friends?
'Cause I'd die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met
Or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Fallin' in and out of love
If I could pick a different end
I'd go back to bein' friends
