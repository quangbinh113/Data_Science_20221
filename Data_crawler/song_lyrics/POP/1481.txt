Song Name: October Passed Me By
I keep the letters that you wrote in a secret place
Every now and then I go down memory lane
October passed me by just like any month
But I still think of the times you took the breath out of my lungs

You don't have run, mm-hm
Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
And could you really blame me though?
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you, who else could it be?
You were the first to make me feel like I was me

Just a memory
It wasn't all good, yeah, it wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip while tryna go steady
Holding on to you like, maybe one day we'll meet
I met you at the wrong time, didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars, you were looking at me
For better or for worse?
I don't know, but for what it's worth
I made you my whole world

I made you my whole world
Screamin' at the top of my lungs, I love you, my girl
Always in the back of my mind, you'll be my girl
