Song Name: Meet us in the park we used to play.
Riding bikes with kicks like 1980s again
I don't know where we goin'
But このままがいい
Say we're loved
Leave your anger
Baby, no worries
Just try, don't think too much
We are young and wild
You are beautiful tonight
Be alright
Oh, no, yea-ay
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh, ayy
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh
Oh, no, yea-ay, yea-ay
You are not alone
We live the moment
迷えば, remember how you made it, made it
Up to today, today
And I got 高鳴る胸 hold on tight
Let me dive into the sky
Just try, don't think too much
We are young and wild
You are beautiful tonight
Be alright
Oh, no, yea-ay
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh, ayy
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh
Oh, no, yea-ay, yea-ay
So when you've been high and need air
戻って来て we have our home
They don't know how but we do
We know what we need is so we are
Oh, no, yea-ay
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh, ayy
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh
Oh, no, yea-ay
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh, ayy
Oh, no, yea-ay, oh
Oh, no, yea-ay, yea-ay
