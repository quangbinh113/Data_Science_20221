Song Name: 4 And 20
They say time waits for no man
And neither does this woman
I've been trying hard to understand
Would it be?
Many moons have come and gone
And this little heart's still holding on
To what could be, maybe should be, baby
Crazy is all it's making me
I've been holding on for way too long
It can't go on
You've got 4 and 20 hours
Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power
Make me believe
You'll take me where I wanna be
4 and 20 hours
And that's me, hmm, baby
That's me, yes
They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But, hey, they've got nothing
On the patience
That it's taking me to wait
See the sands of the hourglass
Are slipping through your hands
Every grain has got to hurt you
Takes you further from your chance
I've been holding on for way too long
(It's been too long)
Either you're in or you're out
You've got 4 and 20 hours
(24 hours, one day)
Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power
(Show me)
Make me believe
You'll take me where I wanna be
4 and 20 hours
And that's me
See everyday I
I walk out of my front door
And I've been wishing and hoping
That today is the day
That you're gonna
You gonna smile in front of my face
And tell me something
Something worth talking about
Tell me that you love me
Tell me you gonna be a man
Show off for me, baby
You got one day
I will give you 24 hours, baby
That's all you should need
Ooh
24 hours should be
Should be enough for you, love
Just make me believe
(Take me where I wanna be)
Make me believe
That you're the man for me, baby
Ooh, yeah
I gotta believe you, baby
I'm gonna need more than flowers
Honey, child, more than talk
I'm telling you, 4 and 20 hours
4 and 20 hours
It should be more than enough for you
