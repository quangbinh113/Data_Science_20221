Song Name: JD's song
Tiramisu
Not as good as I want it to be
Could live without it
It wouldn't be so hard
Won't say a word
About that chocolate cake you made
You wouldn't be happy
And I would be sorry
It's not my fault you're angry
I just said I was hungry
It's better to be honest
(Pa-la-ba-pa-pa-la-ba)
No need to look so cranky
I just prefer some candy
It's better to be honest
I could have said
All the things that you wanna hear
But would it be better?
I guess we'll never know
What can I do?
I'd rather say what I really feel to you
'Cause I never wanna hurt you in any way
(Hey, ho! Hey, ho!)
(Hey, ho! Hey, ho!)
It's not my fault you're angry
I just said I was hungry
It's better to be honest
(Pa-la-ba-pa-pa-la-ba)
No need to look so cranky
I just prefer some candy
It's better to be honest
Yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la la-la la-la
