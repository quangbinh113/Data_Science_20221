Song Name: New Moon
You don't know me anymore
You don't, do ya?
This silver dress feels like a cure
It's like, "Ooh, yeah"
I don't see a metal door
I look through ya
Right at my future
Used to drain me, and push me, and pull me
But I'm not that somebody that you used to bully
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you
You're the bitter, I'm the sweet
You know I'm right, yeah
And you feel good out here with me
With every fiber (yeah)
Make a lightning in the deep
Shooting fire
It's about to rise, yeah (about to rise, yeah)
Used to drain me, and push me, and pull me
But I'm not that somebody that you used to bully
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
Don't you know it's a new moon? (Moon)
And I'm over you, over you
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you (I'm over you)
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you
Treatin' me like that, spinnin' me like that
You kept rippin' up my emotions, callin' it devotion
You won't get away with that (you won't get away)
Spinnin' it like that (no matter what)
I was drownin' in your ocean
Now I'm done with that
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you (I'm over you)
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you (I'm over you)
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me (oh, baby)
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you (I'm over you)
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me
Bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you
