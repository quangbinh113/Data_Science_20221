Song Name: Sometimes
Pink clouds over the skyline
Sitting on the rooftop with you
Red teeth drinking cheap wine
The city shines silver, gold and blue
Oh they say love's supposed to hurt
But everything you throw at me it burns
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
Even if it hurts like hell
It hurts too much to love
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
You gotta tell yourself
It hurts too much to love
Look at the people down in the city
They look so tiny from up here
And I feel calm when you're with me
Like all our problems disappear
Oh they say love's supposed to hurt
But everything we touch just starts to burn
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
Even if it hurts like hell
It hurts too much to love
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
You gotta tell yourself
It hurts too much to love
You have seen the darkness in my eyes
And I can see the demons in your smile
And even if there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
There's no coming back for me and you
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
Even if it hurts like hell
It hurts too much to love
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
Even if it hurts like hell
It hurts too much to love
Sometimes
You gotta let somebody go
You gotta tell yourself
It hurts too much to love
