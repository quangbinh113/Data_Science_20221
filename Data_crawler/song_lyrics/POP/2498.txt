Song Name: Words (feat. Zara Larsson)
I got the words "I love you" sittin' on the tip of my tongue

At your house again, are we more than friends?
There's so much that I wanna say
But I gotta hold it back, so scared how you'll react
I just hide it all away
I could give you it all, in a minute we'll fall
Any minute, but we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment, but I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down, me down
I got the words "I love you" sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth, you're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
You know we connect more than just the sex
But are you gonna let me in?
I can set your world on fire, but you're holdin' the lighter
Instead you're puttin' out our flame
I could give you it all, in a minute we'll fall
Any minute, but we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment, but I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down
I got the words "I love you" sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth, you're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away (run)
Run away (run)
Run away (run!)
I got the words "I love you" sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth, you're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
If I say it now
Then one day I'll wake up and you've walked out (you've walked out)
So I just stay here
With the words "I love you" sittin' on the tip of my tongue
(Sittin' no the tip of my tongue)
