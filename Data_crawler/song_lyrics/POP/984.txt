Song Name: iPad
I go through your iPad lookin' for
Something that I used to have
Guess I finally lost my mind
I wish that I could take my number back
Go back to the place we met
Start this up a second time
You're living in a past life, 25
All your friends are verified
Acting like they're first in line
I'm looking at your life through cellophane
Hoping things would stay the same
I was always by your side
And isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
And now we're strangers again
And now we're strangers again
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive
I wonder where your friends are
Where you go? Who you know now?
You play the same card, swear to God, do you call him?
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
And now we're strangers again
And now we're strangers again
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like 17
Hurt me 'til I feel alive
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Now both of us know, we were better as friends
When it all, yeah, when it all falls apart
Sometimes you let go just to know where to start
Something that I used to have
Something that I used to have
Something that I used to have
And now we're strangers again
Something that I used to have
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like 17
Hurt me 'til I feel alive
