Song Name: STAR WALKIN' (League of Legends Worlds Anthem)
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
On the mission to get high up, I know that I'ma die
Reaching for a life that I don't really need at all (at all)
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed too
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Been that nigga since I came out my mama (hoo)
Thanking God, daddy never wore a condom (hoo)
Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me, come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed too
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
I'm star walkin'

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight, and I'm speeding
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
