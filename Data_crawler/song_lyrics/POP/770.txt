Song Name: The Cabin
A pair of slippers are left just for me
At the front door
And I found myself happy in the dark
There's no one with me at all
Cause I fall and I long for the wild
Love watching the crescent moon hangs in the sky
Looking on the other side
I won't lie to myself anymore
Everybody wants somebody to be there for
Already miss the busy sound
That take me back to the crowd
I've been too lonely in the cabin out of town
Sometimes a habit of smiling to
Strangers happening
Cause I like making random conversation
So I found that the world is too wide
To live our life alone
We all learn to step outside of the comfort zone
Perhaps we are all chasing a mirage
The whole universe is being kind to us
