Song Name: More Than I Want To
We swore that it was over
On a pier in Santa Monica
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
At first it felt like closure
But there's no moving on from us
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
I can't forget you
I just don't know how
I know what we said
But where are you now?
I want you, I want you
More than I want to
I want you, I want you
I'll never know why
I hate that I called you
I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you
More than I want to tonight
I hate that I called you
I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you
More than I want to
More than I want to tonight
I'll be staring out the window
Waiting for your car again
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
I know that we both know
We'll be taking it too far again
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
It just might kill me
The watching you leave
But it's worth one more night
Of you here with me
I want you, I want you
More than I want to
I want you, I want you
I'll never know why
I hate that I called you
I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you
More than I want to tonight
I want you, I want you
More than I want to
I hate that I called you
I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you
More than I want to
More than I want to
I hate that I called you
I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you
More than I want to tonight
