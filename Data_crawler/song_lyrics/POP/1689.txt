Song Name: SOS (feat. Aloe Blacc)
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clear again I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow
I can feel your love
Pullin' me up from the underground and
I don't need my drugs
We could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch
Pickin' me up from the underground and
I don't need my drugs
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how but I need to now
I can feel your love
Pullin' me up from the underground and
I don't need my drugs
We could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch
Pickin' me up from the underground and
I don't need my drugs
We could be more than just part-time lovers, ay
I can feel your touch
Pickin' me up from the underground and
I don't need my drugs
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be
We could be more than just part-time lovers
Yeah, more than, more than lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
