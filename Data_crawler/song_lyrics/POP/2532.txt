Song Name: Perfect Melody
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Still don't know I did that to you
I know now that I did you wrong
You were something I wasn't used to
All I did, I did because
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
I don't know how you do this to me (oh yeah)
All I know that it's all my fault, yeah (oh yeah)
I don't know who the hell I've been fooling
Without you, I only fall apart
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
I'm falling into pieces without you
I'm caught on my feelings about you
Falling into pieces without you
Over and over again
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
