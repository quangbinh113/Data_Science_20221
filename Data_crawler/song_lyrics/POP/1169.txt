Song Name: Where Are You Now
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Five days on the freeway
Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fast lane
We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)
Playing "Sweet Child O' Mine"
And I still feel that line
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long
Too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Where are you now?)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, it's been too long
Some days I can feel it
But the feeling ain't all blue (yeah, yeah)
You got me believing
One day you gotta come through (yeah, yeah)
Lost in these city lights
'Cause I can't sleep tonight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long
Too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
