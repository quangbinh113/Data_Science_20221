Song Name: Fix It to Break It
Remember that time I made you laugh
I would give in to hear that sound again
Missing the lines on both sides of your face
And I hate that that's all I have now
Am I just fixing it just to break it?
Am I just hanging on, just so we can drown?
Like the love we thought we found, no
We're hoping that we don't just hit the ground
I've been pulling you close, but pushing me further
I've been holding it back, that I see you different
Sick of me remindin' you to love me like you say you do
And I've been hurting myself to keep you from leaving
I've been wonderin' whether we'll last the season
Wish we could've made this work
But now I know that I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more
Afraid that I'll lose you in the crowd
I wish that I was a priority
Then you walked out on me with a straight look on your face
And said you've had enough
But then you came back in to try to fix it
But never helping me when I start to drown
Like the love we thought we found
Is it worth the pain if I should stick around?
And I've been pulling you close, but pushing me further
I've been holding it back, that I see you different
Sick of me reminding you to love me like you say you do, oh
And I've been hurting myself to keep you from leaving
I've been wondering whether we'll last the season
Wish we could've made this work
But now I know that I need more

And I need more
And I need more
And I need more
And I need more, I need more
