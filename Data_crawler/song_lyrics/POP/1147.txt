Song Name: Running Wild (Tumblr Girls 2) (feat. Kossisko)
Oh my God, last night was so crazy
Story about a girl I know
Moving all crazy, missing those calls
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I'm trying to get to you, but you're making it hard
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah)
You said you're running wild, running wild, running wild
You love running wild, running wild, running wild
Girl, just slow it down, could you slow it down?
'Cause you running wild and free
Yeah
She's running wild these days
Got in a fight that other night, now we ain't spoke in three days
You raised in at South Beach, a couple of your friends had b-days
Someone said they seen you with somebody, you used up your cheat days
It's fucked up (fuck)
Pot calling the kettle black
Hate the fact you wildin' out and I'm trippin' trying to get you back
All of the sudden the tables turn, trying to keep this shit intact
Know you'll be the death of me, I'm saying, look, that's just a fact
I'm in love with these Tumblr girls with skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty face and love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man, I swear she's just like tons of girls, it's all pretend, can't see it
You just wanna live carefree, your soul's wild, go free it
Moving all crazy, missing those calls
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, you missing all my calls)
I'm trying to get to you, but you're making it hard
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, I feel like you're a million miles away)
You said you're running wild, running wild, running wild
You love running wild, running wild, running wild
Girl, just slow it down, could you slow it down?
'Cause you're running wild and free (yeah, uh)
On a flight to Miami sittin' first class with champagne
Penthouse at the Mondrian, all her model friends came
She likes running wild and free, she's the one you can't tame
Unfamiliar with the real world, she just think it's a game
On Monday she's in love with me, she can't imagine no other (facts)
Tuesday we get in a fight, on Wednesday blockin' my number (wow)
Thursday she's partying, hits Richie, 1 OAK, she's covered
Goes to sleep at six a.m., Friday shootin' the cover
I'm in love with these Tumblr girls with skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty face and love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man, I swear she's just like tons of girls, it's all pretend, can't see it
You just wanna live carefree, your soul's wild, go free it
Moving all crazy, missing those calls
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I'm trying to get to you, but you're making it hard
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah)
You said you're running wild, running wild, running wild
You love running wild, running wild, running wild
Girl, just slow it down, could you slow it down?
'Cause you running wild and free (yeah, uh)
It's all good though
Yeah, uh
