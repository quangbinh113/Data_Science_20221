Song Name: Static
Baby, you got something in your nose
Sniffing that K, did you fill the hole?
Hope you find peace for yourself
New boyfriend ain't gon' fill the void
Do you really even like this track?
Take away the drugs, would you feel the noise?
More and more, you try to run away
You're fucking yourself, do you feel the toy?
Uh, looking for a bitch 'cause I'm over boys
Would you be my girlfriend, baby? (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Something turned me off
Smoking made me-
'Cause I'm longing, for something secure
If you had to stunt your shining for your lover, dump that fucker
Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
