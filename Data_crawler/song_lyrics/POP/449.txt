Song Name: Yellow - Live from Spotify London
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
All the things you do
They were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
Everything you do
It was called Yellow
Then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
You know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
What a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
And your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
You know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
