Song Name: I Don't Know You
There's a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
I don't know you
I don't know you
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don't mind you
And babe, this isn't right
But if you ever dry your eyes
Then honestly, I'm fine
With keeping my trust in you
It's time to walk in my shoes
It's true, I tried making it up to you
If I did all that I had to do
Would you be here in my room?
There's a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
I don't know you
I don't know you
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face
And remind you
I don't mind you
I may have been alright
But babe, it's only half the time
And honestly, I'm fine
With keeping my own advice
And making up if we tried
I'm hardly unsatisfied
You're not heels over head, but darling
There's a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
I don't know you
I don't know you
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don't mind you
