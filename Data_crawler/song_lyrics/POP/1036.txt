Song Name: Circles
Don't leave, slowly
If you're goin', pull the covers over me
I need a lover to save me
To help me please
Oh, I don't care if it's for forever
I don't have to wait for the weather
Tell me when he takes you home
Does he love you like I love you?
Does he love you like I love you?
Or are we runnin' in circles?
Are we runnin' in circles?
Does he know you like I know you?
Does he hold you like he's supposed to?
Tell me, where did your heart go?
Why are we runnin' in circles?
Why are we runnin' in circles? (Ooh)
I'll try to get by
But it's slowly livin'
In this stranger's eyes
I thought I knew ya
But some things never turn out right
Now there's distance between us
That I can't climb
I hope you'll be alright
Does he love you like I love you?
Does he love you like I love you?
Or are we runnin' in circles?
Are we runnin' in circles?
Does he know you like I know you?
Does he hold you like he's supposed to?
Tell me, where did your heart go?
Why are we runnin' in circles? Oh-whoa
Oh, I don't care if it's for forever
I don't have to wait for the weather
Oh, I already know
Where you go, you know I'll follow
I don't care if you fell from Heaven
If you're gonna dance with the devil
Tell me when he takes you home
Does he love you like I love you?
Does he love you like I love you?
Are we runnin' in circles?
Are we runnin' in circles?
Does he know you like I know you?
Does he hold you like he's supposed to do?
Tell me where did your heart go?
Why are we runnin' in circles?
Why are we runnin' in circles?
