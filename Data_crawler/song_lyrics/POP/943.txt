Song Name: Do You Wanna Do Nothing with Me?
We're all looking for someone, that perfect girl
Who can take our hand and help us see the world
But I'm a little unusual, because you see
I seek a different type of thrill for my romantic fantasy
And I must say
I'm looking your way
'Cause you seem to like me, baby
And you give me all the signs
There's just one activity on my mind
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do something with me tonight?
I'll put on my finest sweatpants, and I'll order you pad thai
We'd be living our dream as our love grows
What an intimate occasion, you and me and HBO
'Til morning light
So wrong, yet so right
So say you want it, darling
'Cause you know I want it too
And there's just one thing that I wanna do
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Let's talk it through
In case you're confused
'Cause I know I can seem lazy
From these things I like to do
But they're only worth it when I'm with you
Yeah, it's true, so do you
Wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nothing with me
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nothing with me
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nothing with me
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
(Do you wanna do)
(Do you wanna do)
(Do nothing with me?)
