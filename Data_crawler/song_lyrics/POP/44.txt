Song Name: One Sweet Day
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say...
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away-ay-ay-ay...
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin' knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive alive
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
Darlin' I never showed you...
(I never showed you)
Assumed you'd always be there
(I thought you'd always be there)
And I... I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
(But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together
(I know I know)
One sweet day
And all that I know is I'll wait patiently to see you in Heaven
W-h-o-o-a-a...
Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter d... ay...
Y-e-a-h... yeah
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many (like so many) friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
Yes I know I know we'll be together
Y-e-a-h... yeah
(One sweet day)
One sweet day one sweet day
Oh, y-e-a-h...
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
(I'll see you eventually)
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(I know you're lookin' for a Heaven)
And I know I... know I... know eventually we'll be together
Ooh-ooh (yes we will)
One sweet day...
(One sweet day...)
Patiently to see you in Heaven
Sorry I never told you
(Ooh...) All I wanted to say
