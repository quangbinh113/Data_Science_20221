Song Name: Man On The Moon
What happens in dreams when we fly?
Never been a science tonight
Staring through a window in time
For someone to show me what I'm like
He said, "Hello", it's like a mirror in the sky
And I can see this from up high
Oh boy, we looking good tonight
And I just don't understand
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, we'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, we'll be okay, yeah
He said, "Hello", it's like a mirror in the sky
And I can see this from up high
Oh boy, we looking good tonight
And I just don't understand
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, we'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon (on the moon)
On the moon, yeah, I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, yeah, on the moon
We'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon, he wore his set to the side
I met the man on the moon, he asked if I had a life
He told us to hold it together, we're falling apart
He told us to light up the world when we dream in the dark, yeah
I met the man on the moon
(I met the man on the moon), on the moon
I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon (I met the man, yeah)
On the moon, we'll be okay, yeah
Lost all my tears have turned to dust
Maybe somebody is calling us
Man on the moon, yeah
Just the man on the moon
