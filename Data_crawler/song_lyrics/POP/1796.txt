Song Name: This Love (Taylorâ€™s Version)
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me (oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh oh oh)
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh oh oh)
This love
This love
This love
This love
This love
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave

Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh oh oh)
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, (oh, oh, oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh oh oh)
This love, oh
This love
This love
This love
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
