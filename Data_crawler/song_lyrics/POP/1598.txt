Song Name: Big Yellow Taxi
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop
They took all the trees, and put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'till it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot
Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop
Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'till it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot
Hey now!
They paved paradise, to put up a parking lot
Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop
