Song Name: 100sadsongs
Seat back, the air gives me peace of mind
Windows rolled down into better times
Wish I knew things would get harder sooner
Wish I knew facts were just petty rumors
So now I'm not giving no fucks
Eyes closed, hands up
Had to give away my heart to get some good luck
Betting all my chips all in
I'll see you when I see you again
Foot on the gas
In a hurry and I didn't even pack
A little blurry tryna hold tears back
I said goodbye to the life we had
I toss the phone
Friends calling but I wanna be alone
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look like I swim when I really drown
Voices in my head have been getting loud
Weigh myself down, I'm a heavy thinker
See my whole life slipping through my fingers
Is this all a test or is it a guess?
I would never stay so that's why I left
They lyin' right to your face
Life ain't getting much sweeter than this
Foot on the gas
In a hurry and I didn't even pack
A little blurry tryna hold tears back
I said goodbye to the life we had
I toss the phone
Friends calling but I wanna be alone
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs (yeah)
Ran off
Must've played about a hundred sad songs (a hundred sad songs)
Must have played about a hundred sad songs
Must have played about a hundred sad songs (bunch of sad songs, bunch of sad songs, bunch of sad songs)
Ran off
Must have played about a hundred sad songs
Must have played about a hundred sad songs
Must have played about a hundred sad songs (sad songs, sad songs)
Foot on the gas
In a hurry and I didn't even pack
A little blurry tryna hold tears back
I said goodbye to the life we had (said goodbye, said goodbye)
I toss the phone
Friends calling but I wanna be alone (I wanna be alone)
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs (sad songs)
'Bout to listen to a hundred sad songs
(A hundred sad songs, talkin' 'bout a hundred sad songs)
