Song Name: Fall in Love
It's amazing when I first saw you
Automatic you came into my life
When you gave me a reason to try
Hold me closer in your arms
Anyone who tries to break our love
Show them we'll never part
When we try to catch the stars
They will fall in love oh no
Falling in love
Just a look in your eyes
There is a promise inside your heart
We're so much in love
Forever & ever in love
I remember the night that I was with you
You were tender to keep me inside
Ooh I wonder how we are forever
Tell me my love that I'm the one
Stay with me stay in little heaven
I will ease all your mind
My heart keeps going only for your name
Cause you're the only one I'm dreaming of
Falling in love
Just a look in your eyes
There is a promise inside your eyes
We're so much in love
Forever & Ever in love
There is only you
Deep inside my heart
I'm for sure you will lead me into your love
I love you more & more
Falling in love
Just a look in your eyes
There is a promise inside your heart
We're so much in love
Forever & Ever in love
Look In your eyes
Falling in love
Look in your eyes
