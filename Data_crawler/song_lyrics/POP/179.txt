Song Name: Breathless
Go on, go on
Leave me breathless
Come on

Hey, yeah
The daylight's fading slowly, but time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you, only the slightest touch and I feel weak
I can not lie from you, I cannot hide
I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this loving, feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah
And if there's no tomorrow and all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you, you're all the love I need somehow
It's like a dream, although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)
Don't leave it (don't leave it)
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this loving, feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on (c'mon, c'mon)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I can't lie from you, I cannot hide
And I've lost my will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this loving, feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Go on, go on
