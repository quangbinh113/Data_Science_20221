Song Name: Miss You
Don't remind me
I'm minding my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't remind me
I'm minding my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
