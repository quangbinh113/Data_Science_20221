Song Name: Square (2017)
All the colors and personalities
You can't see right through what I truly am
You're hurting me without noticing
I'm so, so broke like someone just robbed me
I'm no invincible
I have much memories of getting more weaker
Know I'm not loveable
But you know what you'd have to say
"Come on, let's go to bed
We gonna rock the night away
Who did that to you, babe?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day
Would you want me in, bae?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come take my arms and go
I'll be yours for sure"
All the traces and reminiscences
You can't sense right through how I truly was
You were gripping me without noticing
Was so, so strange like someone never loved me
I'm no invincible
I have much memories of getting more weaker
Know I'm not loveable
But you know what you'd have to say
"Come on, let's go to bed
We gonna rock the night away
Who did that to you, babe?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day
Would you want me in, bae?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come take my arms and go
I'll be yours for sure"
You're the only one, who saw my yesterday
The one who knows I'm here alive today
Comfort me, say what I mean to you
You should know what you have to say
"Come on, let's go to bed
We gonna rock the night away
Who did that to you, babe?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day
Would you want me in, bae?
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come take my arms and go
I'll be yours for sure"
