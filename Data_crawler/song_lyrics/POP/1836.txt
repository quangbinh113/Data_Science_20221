Song Name: Sky is the Limit
Perfect
I didn't know what perfect was before you
Walls that I had up you came and tore through
Where did they go?
Now I'm nervous
What if you wake up and words feel empty
What if it gets easy to forget me
You need to know
I wanna take you out
Show you off to my friends
I wanna love you over and over again
It's true, the sky is the limit with you
Sometimes I think about the world that we'll make
And the life that we'll create
Love to dream it away
It's a new beginning
Isn't it great?
I was just waiting, patiently aching
You have me changing
I feel brand new
I wanna take you out
Show you off to my friends
I wanna love you over and over again
It's true, the sky is the limit with you
And on your worst days
I can pull you in
We're an endless story that I wanna live
It's true
The sky is the limit with you, hmm hmm
(Uh uh uh uh uh)
(Uh uh uh uh uh)
(Oh oh oh)
Oh I wanna take you out
Show you off to my friends
I wanna love you over and over again
It's true, the sky is the limit with you
The sky is the limit with you
