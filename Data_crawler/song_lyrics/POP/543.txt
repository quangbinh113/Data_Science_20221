Song Name: Death of a Bachelor
Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck
How do I live?
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, ooh
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck
How do I live?
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
