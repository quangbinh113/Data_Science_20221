Song Name: Baby Why
Baby, why
Am I crazy for you?
Circlin' back again
We're in love, now just friends
Funny how it never ends
Next week I'll be back with you
Then I'll feel used
Before I met you, well, I was doin' fine
Insanity seems to be our standard normality
Because I can guarantee
We'll scratch, we'll fight with such rage
And try to upstage
Then swear that we'll change
This time we'll do it right
How did you manage to come here and screw up my life?
It ain't right
Baby, why
Am I crazy for you?
Baby, why
Do you make me so blue?
He loves me, loves me not
Swear that I'm movin' on
Then tick tock like a clock
We swing back and forth
Just like pendulums
In my livin' room
We're both screamin', you're leavin'
Wait, I didn't mean it
How did you manage to come here and screw up my life?
Get out of my mind
Baby, why
Am I crazy for you?
Baby, why
Do you make me so blue?
It's hard for me to lie, lie, lie
I can't deny
I kinda like
Our lovely life
Tell me, why
Am I crazy for you?
Baby, I
Wouldn't change loving you
