Song Name: Velvet
Honey i know
I'm such a fool
What's left of you
I won't refuse
Wouldn't it be nice to spend our time
Holding hands and sleeping in my arms?
I need some time
To think it through
I need to know
Where this would go
You always seem to linger in my mind
Are you the missing piece i've long to find?
Oooh, i love you so
(I love you so)
Even when you lose your happy glow
(Your happy glow)
Cause i'll love you, forever
Honey i'm true
(I'm true)
To what
(To what)
I feel
And honey i'm sure
My love is real
I don't wanna waste another day
I'll go anyway to make you stay
Oooh, i love you so
(I love you so)
Even when you lose your happy glow
(Your happy glow)
Cause i'll love you, forever
