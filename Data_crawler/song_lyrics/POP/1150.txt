Song Name: I Want It All
All I could do, I've done
Down every road I've run
Just tryna find someone, but
I did it all for nothing
Looked for the fire that burnt
Held out so much hope it hurt
They're not mistakes, I've learnt
When it comes to love, I'm searching for
Not just someone I can live with
I want someone I can't live without
Not just someone I can be with
I need someone I can't be without
I will stop at nothing until I find the one
I want it all and then some
I want it all and then some
I was a fool, you know
'Cause who'd ever let you go?
But when the story's told
The one, it all just would be for nothing
I made you feel worthless
You should have felt priceless
I was in the wrong, yeah
But now I'm gonna right this
No, I didn't see it from the start
But now I know exactly who you are
You're not just someone I can live with
You're someone I can't live without
Not just someone I can be with
You're someone I can't be without
I will stop at nothing 'cause I know you're the one
I want it all and then some
I want it all and then some
Yeah, made you feel worthless
You should have felt priceless
I was in the wrong, yeah
But now I'm gonna right this
Didn't see it from the start
But now I know exactly who you are
You're not just...
Just another love, this story happens once
You're not just...
Just another love, this story happens once
You're not just someone I can live with
You're someone I can't live without
I want it all and then some...
And then some
You're not just someone I can live with
You're someone I can't live without
Not just someone I can be with
You're someone I can't be without
I will stop at nothing 'cause I know you're the one
I want it all and then some...
I want it all and then some...
