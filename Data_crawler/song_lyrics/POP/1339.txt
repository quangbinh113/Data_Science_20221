Song Name: Cold Water (feat. Justin Bieber & MÃ˜)
Everybody gets high sometimes
You know
What else can we do when
We're feeling low
So take a deep breath
And let it go
You shouldn't be
Drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you
And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
Cause we all get lost
Sometimes you know
It's how we learn
And how we grow
And I wanna lay with
Until I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting
On your own
And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you
And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
Come on, Come on
Save me from the rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope
Someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul (rest my soul)
I need to know, you won't let go
(I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I won't let go, go
