Song Name: Soy Boy
My skinny arms
Strong enough to pick any fruit you want
Not very tall
But I can reach on my toes
And you'll be warm
Next to a peach fuzz herbivore
Soy tu amor
No macho man
I wanna be your
Soy boy
How do I do it?
Soy boy
How do I do it, baby?
Soy boy
How do I do it?
If you knew me, boy, would you be going green
Let's spill the beans
You must be nuts to not want me
I'm in your dreams
Planted seed, let it grow
The time is ripe
I could be the apple of your eye
If I'm not your type
That's alright
But I wanna be your
Soy boy
How do I do it?
Soy boy
How do I do it, baby?
Soy boy
How do I do it?
If you knew me, boy, would you be going green
