Song Name: Charlie Be Quiet!
Charlie be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
I'm not making the same mistake
Won't be putting my heart on display
I'll just water my feelings down
I'm not going out looking dumb
Telling all my friends how you're the one
Those words never leaving my mouth
But the feeling gets
Stronger, baby
What am I gonna do now?
When you touch me
'Cause you're talking too loud
Charlie be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
Charlie be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
I'm not gonna do more than like
Won't be sleeping over every night
I'll act like I don't even care, yeah
I'm not going out lookin' dumb
Telling all my friends I found someone
Then waking up without you there
But the feeling gets
Stronger, baby
What am I gonna do now?
When you touch me
'Cause you're talking too loud
Charlie be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
Charlie be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
If she knows you're in love
She's gonna run, run away-ay-ay-ay
