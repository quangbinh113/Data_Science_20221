Song Name: break my heart
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
Woke up and I panicked for a moment
Forgot that you told me that you had to go
And I'm scared but I don't wanna show it
Feels like it's been weeks but it's only been days and
I'm slowly losing all my self-control
There's only one thing I can say, it's
"I could spend forever always loving you
But if I let you go, would you be happier?"
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours
I'll be lying if I said that it'd be easy
To realize that I wouldn't have you by my side
But I'd do it if that's what you needed
I say that I could let you go
And I pray I never have to know
You'll always be the one I love the most
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours
I could spend forever always loving you
But if I let you go, would you be happier?
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours
For yours
