Song Name: 4AM
Dark nights, shadows, I'm running on empty
Cold baths and showers to wake me up
It's been 3 hours since you called me
My spirit is losing without you
And I can't shake it, I just need some sleep
It's 4 in the morning, get closer to me
The way we figure out our bodies
They seem to connect all our feelings
And I can't shake it, I just need some sleep
It's 4 in the morning, get closer to me
And I can't shake it, I just need some sleep
It's 4 in the morning, get closer to me
And I can't shake it, I just need some sleep
It's 4 in the morning, get closer to me
