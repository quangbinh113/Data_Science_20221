Song Name: Angel
When I lay down and I fall asleep
Hope I might see you in my dreams
But it's been a few months
Since I seen you in one of these
Can't find where my faith is
I been lost in this basement
Keep searching and searching
I must be looking in the wrong places
But tonight
I swear I never felt so close
Never felt so close
'Cause tonight
I think I might've finally found what I needed most
'Cause I met an angel, an angel
Who told me she knew someone
Who looked just like me
So I asked her to tell him something for me
I said, "Hello, are you there?
And if I told you the truth
Would it be way too much to bear?
'Cause how I feel is something no one knows
My heart broke speeding down that road
Can't stop bleeding but I hide these holes
Just a facade that people want to see
If they took the time to look closely
I'm in agony
I'm in agony
'Til I met an angel, an angel
Who told me she knew someone
Who looked just like me
So I asked her to tell him something for me
