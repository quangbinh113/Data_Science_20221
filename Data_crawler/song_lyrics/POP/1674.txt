Song Name: I Try
Games, changes, and fears
When will they go from here?
When will they stop?
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together babe
But we're not
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey
And I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll try to keep my cool, but I'm feigning
I try to say goodbye and I choke (yeah)
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Here is my confession
May I be your possession?
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny
Deny
And I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
(But I'm dreaming of you, babe)
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning
I try to say goodbye and I choke (yeah)
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble (hey, hey yeah!)
Though I try to hide it, it's clear (said I love y'all)
My world crumbles when you are not here (give y'all kisses and-)
Goodbye and I choke (goodbye, I choke, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
