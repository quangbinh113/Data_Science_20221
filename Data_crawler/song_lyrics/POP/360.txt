Song Name: Head & Heart (feat. MNEK)
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my God, oh my God
This feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done, huh!
Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you, I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings, I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oooh, oh my God, oh my God
Can't believe what I've become (huh)
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh, oh my God, oh my God
When I see you should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop
Feeling feelings, I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough ('cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush (always my heart)
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum (yeah, yeah)
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
My head and my heart (head and heart)
My head and my heart (head and heart)
I can't tell them apart (can't tell them apart)
My head tells me to run, but I can't
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum (oh-ooh-ooh)
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum (yeah, yeah-yeah, ah)
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum (oh-ooh-ooh)
Oh my God, oh my God
This feeling's just begun (feeling just begun-ah-ah)
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you, I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
