Song Name: she's all i wanna be
You want the girl with the small waist, and the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday in her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out, say "it's not that hard"
But I just got a feeling, this'll leave an ugly scar
If you say "she's nothing to worry about"
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
She's got everything that I don't have, mmm-mmm
You want someone you can show off whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight-mini black dress with all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at her nice, big house
And by then I'll just be someone you've forgotten about, oh
If you say "she's nothing to worry about"
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
She's got everything that I don't have
'Cause she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be
She's all I wanna be so bad, oh-oh
Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you would hurt this bad
She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, (all I wanna be) so bad
(So bad) she's got everything that I don't have
'Cause she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad
