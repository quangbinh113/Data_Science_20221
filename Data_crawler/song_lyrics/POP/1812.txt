Song Name: I'm So Happy (with BENEE)
Put me on the first flight
Take me to wherever
Sunny days and cold nights
It don't matter the weather
What could be better
When paradise feels so right without you? (hmm)
My universe kinda works
It's true
I'm so glad to know you
Won't be here to fuck with my mood
No bullshit to argue
I don't hold a thing against you
I'm so grateful
Every day I'm smiling way more
I'm so happy you're not here
Thought that loving you would make me feel loved
When all it ever did was fuck me up
But it's over
Now I can't stand you
And I can't believe all the time
I would waste with you
You'd call me up
We'd fuck, make up
But I couldn't see it back then
That loving you is just a phase, man
And I
I'm so glad to know you
Won't be here to fuck with my mood
No bullshit to argue
I don't hold a thing against you
I'm so grateful
Every day I'm smiling way more
I'm so happy you're not here
I'm having the best time
With you not by my side
Would you rather me fucking lie?
Just don't act so surprised
If I say too much, when you call me
Please shut up, I'm really not sorry
At least it's sincere
I'm so blessed that you're not here
So I
I'm so glad to know you
Won't be here to fuck with my mood
No bullshit to argue
I don't hold a thing against you
I'm so grateful
Every day I'm smiling way more
I'm so happy you're not here
