Song Name: Feel
Come on, hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given
I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don't understand
I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life running through my veins
Going to waste
I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her
I scare myself to death
That's why I keep on running
Before I've arrived
I can see myself coming
I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life running through my veins
Going to waste
And I need to feel real love and a life ever after
I cannot get enough
I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
I got too much love running through my veins
To go to waste
I just wanna feel real love in a life ever after
There's a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face
It's a real big place

Come on, hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
