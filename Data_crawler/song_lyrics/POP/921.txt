Song Name: Futures
Bring down the cool, gray water
Voice went back on along
Need to change that filter
Where are those leaves blowing from?
Goes in a pile by the pool house
Watching the glass by your shoes
Like I'm swimming in seltzer
Diving into the blue
You never mentioned leaving
Just been up there speaking with your boy
A little place near morrow
Staring at the sea
But I'm still tryna stop your shadow slipping down the hallway
Like a train that I can't catch
Left the city here, the same as always
I always think too much
Waited to run 'til the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you'll never know
Where do all those futures go?
As long as the snow keeps falling
I'm in no rush to get back
Try to find my own temple
'Cause this city never wakes up
Tryna keep warm in this raincoat
Couple of books in my bag
Threw a coin in the fountain
Still listening out for the splash
I never saw you leaving
But I know you had some good years with your boy
Up on your own tomorrow
Staring at the sea
But I'm still tryna stop your shadow slipping down the hallway
Like a train that I can't catch
Left me sitting here, the same as always
I always think too much
Waited to run 'til the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you'll never know
Where do all those futures go?
Waited to run 'til the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you'll never know
Where do all those futures go?
