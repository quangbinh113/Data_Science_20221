Song Name: Let Me Go
I don't know what, what I'm doing here
When you look at me, I try to dress up my fears
I should learn to carry the world
But I act like a girl, sit and cry on the sofa
I let the time fly so fast
I don't even know myself
So don't expect me to be like you
Please let me go on my way
I'll just take my time for a change
Do you still believe in me?
Everything will be ok
One day, I will be the same
I can't figure out, what am I gonna do?
I'm stuck in the past, can't stop thinking about you
Looking out of the window, now is the time to grow
But I act like dont know, still lazy on the sofa
I let the time fly so fast
I don't even know myself
So don't expect me to be like you
Please let me go on my way
I'll just take my time for a change
Do you still believe in me?
Everything will be ok
One day, I will be the same
