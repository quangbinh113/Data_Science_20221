Song Name: Blow Your Mind (Mwah)
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
(Hey!)
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show

Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
(Hey!)
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah)
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah)
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
(Hey!)
Mwah!
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
