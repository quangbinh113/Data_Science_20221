Song Name: Jiggle Jiggle
Louis Theroux, Duke & Jones
Jiggle, jiggle
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I'd like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me wanna dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two, in a compact
No slack, but luckily, the seats go back
I've got a knack to relax, in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine
Shepherd's Bush, my compact push
Notting Hill Gate, my Fiat skates
With a crate of Cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the 'gnac
With Big and Reece, 200 diamonds in their piece
I'm trying to get mine, so I can shine
Jiggle, jiggle
I like to see you, wiggle, wiggle
Jiggle, jiggle
I like to see you, wiggle, wiggle
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I'd like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me wanna dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two, in a compact
No slack, but luckily, the seats go back
I've got a knack to relax, in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine
Think that went really well, don't you?
I enjoyed it, nice being in the booth
So unless you have anything else, that's a wrap
(Jiggle, jiggle)
(I like to see you, wiggle, wiggle)
(Jiggle, jiggle)
(I like to see you, wiggle, wiggle)
