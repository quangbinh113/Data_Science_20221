Song Name: Don't Bring Me Down
No trippin' up
No losing touch
Just keep your eye on what the deal was
No switchin' lanes
No second take
One full start and you lose your nerve
Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Been taking calls in the dead of night
I got my own set of complications
No one can hear me right
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Just forget what's stopping this now
Hit the lobby bell
And help you sell
Guys in here never break a sweat
Little metal joint
No compass point
Taking swings any chance they get
Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Keep hearing shouts in the dead of night
I've got my own set of complications
Nobody's counting right
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I've just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Just forget what's stopping this now
Way-faced slickers
Dough-boy trippers
Last year's figures
Someone's in a rhythm
Kick it
Riptide rhythms
Half-court visions
Quick desicions
Who's in the box seat now?
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Just forget what's stopping this now
