Song Name: One Life
It's such a beautiful night
To make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky
Empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side
Talking 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I
When I look in your eyes
What a wonderful way
To spend a moment of two
To be lying awake
And be here talking to you
I've got something to say
I know what I gotta do
To be making a change
Now the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect? Yeah
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
So I count to three
And get on my knee
And I ask you
Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time
Just to make it right
So I'll ask you tonight
Will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word
One love
One life
A gentle touch of the hand
Fingers running through hair
Lips pressed over lips
Oh, I was caught unaware
I was holding my tie
Tears run through her eyes
What a beautiful way
To spend most of our lives
Sun will reappear
Burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow
Green grass we're on was the bed
Last night was the night
One last moment of true
What a wonderful way
Falling deeper in you
Why was I feeling nervous when
Things where going so perfect? Yeah
And now I know it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
So I count to three
And get on my knee
And I ask you
Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time
Just to make it right
So I'll ask you tonight
Will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word
One love
One life
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be
