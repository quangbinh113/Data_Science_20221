Song Name: House On Fire
(You liar, now I'ma set your house on fire)
I made friends with the head of police
To make sure he'd suspect me the least
If I'm caught, I'd be out in a week
I got my story straight down to a T
Oh, I'd say, "It wasn't me", hm
And sure we dated once in a while
But if there was a motive, it's not enough for a trial
I saw you out, it was zero degrees
And you had your hands right under her sleeves
Oh, you said you don't get cold
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
Running, I'm running back to your place
With gas and a match, it'll go up in flames
Now, I know you're not at home
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
If somebody goes and calls the brigade
I'll already be too far away
I brought a map and I've planned the escape
I'll dye my hair, change my name
You should've seen this from the start
When you could've been honest, you could've been smart
Yeah, we might've touched, we might've kissed
But darling, I'm sorry, it's not enough to convict
I saw you out, it was zero degrees
And you had your hands right under her sleeves
Oh, you said you don't get cold
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
Running, I'm running back to your place
With gas and a match, it'll go up in flames
Now, I know you're not at home
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire

Now I'ma set your house on fire
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
You can look around but you won't find her
She'll be out of town with the getaway driver
That's how it feels when the flames get higher
Now I'ma set your house on fire
