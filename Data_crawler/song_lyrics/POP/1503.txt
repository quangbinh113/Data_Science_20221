Song Name: Before You
Why would I want to fly
Be on the last red eye
Talking to your voice, only hearing noise
Oh, it's not enough
All of the nights I spent
Drowning my discontent
Wasting me away, everything has changed
Now that I found us
And it feels like home
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
Let me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you
Why would I want to go?
Now that you're all I know
Smiling under stars
Playing chasing cars
Somethin' 'bout the art of music in thе dark
And it feels like home
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
Wе could just slow down time
Let me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you
Oh, before you
Uh-uh, uh-uh
I bet I was lost and alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I bet I was lost and alone
I was barley holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I must have been lost and alone
I was barley holding on
To the thought that someone like you exists
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
