Song Name: Outside (feat. Ellie Goulding)
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
Now I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you
Oh-ah, oh-ah, I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, we did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, we did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you, tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose, I'll be the strength in you
Now I'm holding on (now I'm holding on)
My self was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you
Oh-ah, oh-ah, I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, we did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-ah, we did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, I
I'll show you what it feels like, oh (ah)
Oh, I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside (ah)
Oh, we did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
