Song Name: Let It Go
Keep your feelings alive
I know they will survive in that place
Where years of change can't erase them
Let me see what's inside
There's no reason to hide
Be yourself
Nothing else will get in the way
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same
You can run around inside your mind
No fresh air and no easy times
Just the same
You can get out of that game
You can get out of that game
There's no need to explain
What is real or sane
For the love that you give
Will return to you
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same,
Hey hey heyLet the love out of your heart (Let your love flow)
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
There's no need to explain
What is real or sane
For the love that you give
Will return to you
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same
(Give it up, give it up, let your love flow)
Let it go
(Give it up, give it up)
Let it go
(Give it up)
Let it go
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
