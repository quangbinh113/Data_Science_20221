Song Name: Belly Dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you starting, girl?
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Stepping off lookin' bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see it, baby girl
When you talk, I believe it, baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Girl, I must say you the flyest thing in here
You're so hot, we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl, you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standing
Either way you do it, girl, you look outstanding
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
Don't be shy girl, go bananza
Shake your body like a belly dancer
