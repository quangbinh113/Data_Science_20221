Song Name: Somebody Like U
Reflections in the mirror, bathroom light
Both hands on the sink, I'm holding tight
Why are you still glued in my mind?
Silly little me can't win this fight
Even though I know that you're far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catching these feelings
Holding on to the pieces
It's hitting me hard now that I'm
Dancing with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're making me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you with someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you
Looking for your Prius in the parking lot
I know it's not there, but it's all I got
Rain is pouring down, drowning my thoughts
I guess you found yourself another spot
Even though I know that you're far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catching these feelings
Holding on to the pieces
It's hitting me hard now that I'm
Dancing with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're making me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you with someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you
Somebody like you
(Oh, I hate the things you're making me do)
(Somebody like you)
