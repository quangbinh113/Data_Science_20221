Song Name: Player Of Games
Baby, would you still love me
Out on Europa or will you forget? La, la, la, la
Baby, how can I compare
To the adventure out there?
Sail away
To the cold expanse of space
Even love
Couldn't keep you in your place
But can't you love me
Like that?
Can't you need me
Like that?
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay
But he has to be the best
Player of games

If I loved you any less
I'd make him stay
Player of games

I'm in love
With the greatest gamer
But he'll always love the game
More than he loves me (oh, oh, oh)
Sail away
To the cold expanse of space
Even love
Couldn't keep you in your place
But can't you love me
Like that?
Can't you need me
Like that?
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay
But he has to be the best
Player of games
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay

Player of games
Player of games
Player of games
Player of games
