Song Name: Young
Even if all we had was a love song
About this very night on the blue
I know it's okay if the wind blows
Floating us away to the moon
There maybe a shooting star, for Eden's May
There's no need to go back, and so we lay
Is this feeling just my dreaming, we would never know
Let me take you away to cities, you would never go
Is this feeling just my dreaming, we would never know
Let me show you the way to cities, you would never go
I could stay awake in my shadow
Let it hold the pass for a while
Baby, it's okay if the waves grow
Taking us away evermore
There maybe a shooting star, for Eden's May
There's no need to go back, and so we lay
Is this feeling just my dreaming, we would never know
Let me take you away to cities, you would never go
Is this feeling just my dreaming, we would never know
Let me show you the way to cities, you would never go
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
