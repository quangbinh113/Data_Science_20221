Song Name: Love's Train
One, two
Warm night, can't sleep
Too hurt, too weak, gotta call her up

Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock
And if by chance, you let me come over
Out on the street, I wanna see you, baby
And if by chance, you let me just hold ya
I'm down on my knee, I wanna please you, baby
Ooh, I'll be your righteous lover
She said, "Sugar, honey, darling"
I really wanna see you, too
I bet you do, bet you do, bet you do
It's just that someone's over
And baby, I really wanna be with you
But if by chance you let me just hold ya
I'm callin', I'm free, I wanna see you, baby
Ooh, when in need, you said you would be here
And you hold the key to my very being, baby, I
(I love you, baby) I love you, baby
If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
Sometimes, heartstrings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on the love's train
On a warm night, lady wants her baby
So she calls him up (ah-ah-auh)
When it ring-a-ling it only means one thing, come on
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock
And if by chance, you just come on over, girl
I'm sick and, please, I've got to see you, baby
Ooh, when in need
You said you would be right here
Well, I'm in need
I need you to please believe, please believe
I love you, baby
If you are (whoa) that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
You don't need, no, you don't need no ticket to ride
Sometimes, heartstrings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on the love's train
Listen baby, listen baby
If deep sorrow, you've been soakin'
But you just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Love's a hurtin' thing, yo, it makes you want to cry, come on)
If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on the love's train
Oh
