Song Name: 24/7 (feat. JC Stewart)
I got you 24/7, 365
Ever since the moment that I met ya
Swear I'll never die (you're mi-, you're mine)
I got you 24/7, 365, yeah
Mm, the only kind of heaven
That's keeping me alive (you're mi-, you're mine)
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 365
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na)
I got you 24/7, 365
Ever since the moment that I met ya
Swear I'll never die (you're mi-, you're mine)
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 365
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) (365)
Save me, I've been waiting for someone that can change me
When you came along, you stopped the crazy
Nothing lasts forever, oh, but maybe, maybe
I got you 24/7, 365
Ever since the moment that I met ya
Swear I'll never dive (you're mi-, you're mine)
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 365
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na)
I got you 24/7, 365
Ever since the moment that I met ya
I swear I'll never die
I got you 24/7, 365 yeah
Mm, the only kind of heaven
That's keeping me alive (you're mi-, you're mine)
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 365
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) 'til the end of time
(Oh-oh, na-na-na) (365)
