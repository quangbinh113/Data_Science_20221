Song Name: Die Young (feat. 347aidan)
Lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
(Great John on the beat by the way)
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and
Ayy, I don't wanna die young, so I stay with a stick
Still on that shit, fuck two times six
Forgot who I was, let me talk my shit, like
Sturdiana
Buss a move when I get up behind ya
Shorty bad, she get it from her mama
I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back
2018, I was stuck in the trap
Fell in love and I got too attached
Heart got broke, it ain't no comin' back
If we up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, said they no comin' back
Is you with it?
If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute
But, fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get it back when I'm finished
So you can't get it
When l'm cookin', l'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doing business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em a distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different
So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (ayy, ayy)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and
I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breath
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
She for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps
So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)
(I don't wanna die young) Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die, I don't-I don't wanna die young and
(I don't wanna die young) So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
(I don't wanna die young) Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and
Damn
So I'm
Damn
I don't wanna die young and
So I'm
