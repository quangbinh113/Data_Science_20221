Song Name: do you think we're old enough
Summer rain on a window
Watch the time float on
Cool air blows a memento
As I fall behind
I'm so sorry
For dreaming about the future
Maybe I'll be
Better when we're old enough
Hey I'm sorry
For dreaming about the future
You and I'll be
Better when we're old enough
Take apart all the good things
Stripped away what's there to do
So many times I've tried
But I just don't remember
I'm so sorry
For dreaming about the future
Maybe I'll be
Better when we're old enough
Hey I'm sorry
For dreaming about the future
Hey I'm sorry
Do you think we're old enough
Do you think we're old enough
