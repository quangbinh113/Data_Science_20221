Song Name: C'est La Vie (with bbno$ & Rich Brian)
Ayy, uh
Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand By Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Tall bitch, I Attack on Titan
Need a fine VP like Biden
Trap that purp in the gold like a Viking (uh)
Double cup ice like Tampa Lightning
Double cup, ain't no lean
Only sip syrup when I'm with Chief Keef
Play clean, pipe Christine
I pipe correct, I'm so P.C.
Go to the club but I don't even drink
I don't know what to think
Got a girl with me
And we pop in the kitchen
Dick all hard, my nuts on a mission
I got cash, they got coins in my milеage
E-D-D, your credit looking childish
Your girlfriend just changеd her name to my bitch
She got LASIK, I nut on her iris (nut on her iris?)
Bored in the morning, yeah, just like a virus
Tongue game nerdy, ain't talking no Cyrus
Pull up on the booty, yeah, we some pirates
I don't know why, we got huge privates (whoa)
I guess we're kinda blessed, I can't complain about it (uh)
Every day I get another check, I won't complain about it
Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand By Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Bubble bath and a bucket of cash
When your bitch said "Gravy, put it in my ass"
Let's run it (uh) 'cause you kindly asked
And I guess I'll be a gentleman and bust a smash
But then you gotta help me smoke some gas
And count some cash and trap some hash
And then I need a ride to my cooking class
Gravy train choo-choo on that ass
Starin' at a meteor the whip come fair
Bitch, I'm a king, you a peasant in the barracks (bitch)
Chillin' with a pornstar, life like an IMAX
Fuck grammar one time, no syntax
Cock real hard, yeah, I'm horny for the big racks
Crack my nuts, she can juice my gonads
Baby-yes-bucks, yeah, Selena Gomez
Always make big moves, last name nomad
Troll so much, made a song called "u mad!"
Next bar Gravy says I wrote, he mad
Ooh, ayy
Baby, c'est la vie
Finger-lickin' good like it's KFC
I learned to count a mil' before my ABCs
Fuck your doll 'til A, your bitch ate my D
Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand By Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
