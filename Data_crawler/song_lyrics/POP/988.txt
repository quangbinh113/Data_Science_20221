Song Name: gfy (with Machine Gun Kelly)
So tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends?
Wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should've said
Go fuck yourself
Look at this picture, somethin' ain't right
I'm feelin' shitty, broken inside
You cut me up in four-letter lines
Stabbin' my back with this four letter lie
You gave my hoodie to some other guy
I fell for you and I'm payin' the price
Do you do it for clout? Do you do it for hype?
Do you do it for love? Do you do it for likes?
I am so high, the stars in my eyes
I wanna go back, I wanna rewind
You got many faces, Gemini
You're worse than all of my ex's combined
I said that last time would be the last time
You always fuckin' gaslight, you're never all alone
I need to say what's on my mind, and then it's goodbye
You left me high and dry and now I gotta go
So tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends?
I wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should've said
Go fuck yourself
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wish you well but go to hell (ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Go fuck yourself (ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wish you well but go to hell (ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Please, take me out of this episode of Euphoria
Back to the Waldorf Astoria
"Do not disturb" on the door while she screamin'
My D-I-C-K B.I.G. like Notorious
Don't know who that dude on your Story is
But you dumb as fuck for ignorin' this
And I won't remember recordin' this
I'm off these red and blue pills like I'm Morpheus
You started this shit and I'ma make it end, yeah
Heard that you askin' 'bout who I been with
You should ask your friend, damn
I said that last time would be the last time
You always fucking gaslight, you're never all alone
I need to say what's on my mind, and then it's goodbye
You left me high and dry and now I gotta go
So tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends (yeah)
I wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should've said

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (hahaha)
I wish you well but go to hell
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah, ayy, ayy)
Go fuck yourself
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I wish you well but go to hell
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Go fuck yourself
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
