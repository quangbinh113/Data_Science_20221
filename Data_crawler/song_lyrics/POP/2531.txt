Song Name: American Psycho (with Mae Muller feat. Trippie Redd)
I'm a train wreck, kinda jealous
Sometimes I get a little bit selfish
Pessimistic, a little twisted
But at least, I'm not the one that can't admit it
If I had to blame somebody, then you would be that body
You put the "T" in toxic, yeah, you do
Oh, you're so bad for my health
When I should've hated you, you made me hate myself
But I know better now
All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show
True American psycho
Whoa, she said that I'm a psycho (psycho)
Whoa, she said I'm not her type though (yeah)
Ooh, I'm out my mind (mind)
Out my mind (mind)
I didn't mean to fall in love, I didn't mean to lose your trust
You used to call me on the phone
Nowadays, you're only calling me psycho
Oh, you're so bad for my health
When I should've hated you, you made me hate myself
But I know better now
All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show
True American psycho
(I'm so out of my head)
True American psycho
(I'm sorry, better off dead)
True American psycho
If I had to blame somebody, then you would be that body
You put the "T" in toxic, yeah, you do (I'm so done)
All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show
True American psycho
True American psycho
Yeah
True American psycho
