Song Name: 21 Reasons (feat. Ella Henderson)
One is you make me happy
Two is you set me free
From all the things that held me
Back from just being me
Thank you for all the sweetness
Now I can finally breathe
Now I can finally breathe
But baby, don't you see?
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (your friends)
And I hate your moods (moods)
And I still love you
But I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do
Three is the way you hold me
That's what I waited for
Five shots we're getting naughty
Moving around the floor
You took away the lonely and I let you come for me
Loving the company
But baby, don't you see?
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (your friends)
And I hate your moods (moods)
And I still love you
But I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do
My friends say you ain't good enough
And maybe I should give you up (give you up)
But I got my reasons and here comes another one
Here comes another one
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on counting
I shouldn't love you
But I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do (yeah!)
I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on counting
I shouldn't love you
But I got 21 reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I got 21 reasons why I do
