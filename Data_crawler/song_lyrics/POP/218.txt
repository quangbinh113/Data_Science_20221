All she wanna do is party all night
God damn, Roxanne
Never gonna love me but it's alright
She think I'm an asshole
She think I'm a player
She keep running back though
Only 'cause I pay her
Roxanne
Roxanne
All she wanna do is party all night
Met her at a party in the hills, yeah
She just wanna do it for the thrill, yeah
Shawty drive a poodle with no top
But if I throw this money, she gon' drop, ayy
She don't wait in lines if it's too long
She don't drive the whip unless the roof off
Only want to call when the cash out
Only take the pic when her ass out
She from Malibu, Malibu
If you ain't got a foreign then she laugh at you
Malibu, Malibu
Spending daddy's money with a attitude
Roxanne
Roxanne
All she wanna do is party all night
Goddamn, Roxanne
Never gonna love me but it's alright
She think I'm an asshole
She think I'm a player
She keep running back though
Only 'cause I pay her

All she wanna do is party all night
(I just wanna have fun!)
In LA, yeah
Got no brakes, yeah
Living fast, Ricky Bobby, shake 'n' bake, yeah
See the chain? Yeah
It's a lake, yeah
Swipe the chase, ooh
Now she wanna date, yeah
Straight to Nobu
On the coast, ooh
Shawty only like cocaine and whole foods
Yeah, snappin' all up on the 'Gram
Ass going crazy
Now she wanna fuck me in the foreign going 80
Up in Malibu, Malibu
If you ain't got a foreign then she laugh at you
Malibu, Malibu
Spending daddy's money with a attitude
Roxanne

All she wanna do is party all night
God damn, Roxanne
Never gonna love me but it's alright
She think I'm an asshole
She think I'm a player
She keep running back though
Only 'cause I pay her
Roxanne

All she wanna do is party all night
