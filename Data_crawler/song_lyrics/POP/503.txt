Song Name: When I'm Gone
Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words, I guess...
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression
No, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
What happens when you become the main source of pain
"Daddy look what I made"
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's mommy?"
"I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry"
"Why? Why is mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more"
"Daddy you're lyin'"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time"
"But you ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
"This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'"
"You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad"
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'"
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
But baby, wait!
"It's too late, dad, you made the choice"
"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
"That's what they want, they want you Marshall they keep"
"Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep"
"Just take another pill, yeah, I bet that you will"
"You rap about it"
"Yeah, word, k-k-keep it real"
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
There's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to... say
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain
Just smile back
