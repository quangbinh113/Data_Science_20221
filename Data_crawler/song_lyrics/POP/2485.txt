Song Name: Don't Leave Me Lonely
You said that you'd never
Forget me, how you could leave me behind?
Promise me you'll be there
For the good and there for the darkest nights!
You said you'd swim the deepest oceans
Rip the stars right from the sky!
You said that you'd never
Forget me, we'd have each other for life
I could paint over the scars
Take an arrow to the heart
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again
I could learn to picture you
From a different point of view
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again!
Don't leave me lonely!
You are my oxygen
But somehow you still make me forget to breath
I'd go through hell again
For you, 'cause it feels like heaven to me
I'd crush diamonds, run from sirens
Be the world beneath your feet
Oh, you said that you'd never forget me
I'm yours for eternity
I could paint over the scars
Take an arrow to the heart
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again
I could learn to picture you
From a different point of view
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again!
Don't leave me lonely!
