Song Name: Wings
If I had wings I would fly to you
Even if it doesn't make sense at all
If I lose my tongue then I'll be dancing for you
Even when I cannot find a place to do
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
If I had fins I would swim to you
Even if it doesn't make sense at all
If I lose my feet then I'll be singing for you
Even when I cannot find a place to do
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Yeah, I fell in love
Come kiss me, wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
