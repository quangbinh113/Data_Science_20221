Song Name: Snooze
Time
Tell us when to stop
When there's nothing left
To wait for
Try
To wait one more time
When there's nothing left
To wait for
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Try to stop me
Go
Forward or go back
Just make up your mind
You will be fine
There's
Nothing left to hide
I know what's inside
You will be fine
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Don't you say goodbye
Just let me sleep tonight
Till the morning light
Come shining through my eyes
Try to stop me
