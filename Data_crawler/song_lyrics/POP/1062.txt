Song Name: INDUSTRY BABY (feat. Jack Harlow)
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (hey!)
Baby back, ayy, couple racks, ayy
Couple Grammys on him
Couple plaques, ayy
That's a fact, ayy
Throw it back, ayy, throw it back, ayy
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for
I don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't laying low
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
"He don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over" (uh)
Need to, uh, need to get this album done
Need a couple number ones
Need a plaque on every song
Need me like one with Nicki now
Tell a rap nigga I don't see ya (hah)
I'm a pop nigga like Bieber (hah)
I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer (hah)
But these niggas bitches like Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy (yeah)
Oh, let do it
I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit
I blew up, now everybody tryna sue me
You call me Nas, but the hood call me Doobie (yeah)
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they're waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't laying low (bitch, I ain't running from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway (ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say (ooh, ooh)
"He don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over" (yeah)
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be getting too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (mm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talking, we taking notes
Tell 'em all to keep making posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he choking up while he making toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done making jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)
Say your time is coming soon, but just like Oklahoma (mm)
Mine is coming sooner (mm), I'm just a late bloomer (mm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here getting cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walking 'round like they ain't losers
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't laying low (bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway (ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say (ooh, ooh)
"He don't run from nothing, dawg
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over" (yeah)
I'm the industry baby, mmm (yeah)
I'm the industry baby (yeah)
