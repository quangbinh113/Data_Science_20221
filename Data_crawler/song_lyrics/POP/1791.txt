Song Name: Until I Found You (with Em Beihold) - Em Beihold Version
Georgia, wrap me up in all your-
I want you in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
Heaven, when I held you again
How could we ever just be friends?
I would rather die than let you go
Juliet to your Romeo, how I heard you say
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
