Song Name: what would you do?
You think you're such a cool kid
And everybody likes you
Now you think I'm stupid
Say you know more than I do
But what you'll never understand
Is I used to be such a fan
But now you're such a cool kid
It's like I don't even know you, yeah
I'm getting really sick
Sick of how sorry sounds
Coming right out your mouth, oh
Don't get too comfortable
'Cause I might not be there
Next time you turn around, so
What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?
I've always been a nice girl
I'm pretty understanding
But you mess up my head, boy
And you're taking me for granted
And you're prolly gonna throw a fit (throw a fit)
When I call you out on all your shit (all your shit)
Yeah, I used to be a nice girl
I bet you wish it lasted, oh
I'm getting really sick
Sick of how sorry sounds
Coming right out your mouth, oh-oh
Don't get too comfortable
'Cause I might not be there
Next time you turn around, so
What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?
We'll make plans and I won't show up
I won't listen, I'll interrupt
When your birthday comes, won't answer ya 'cause
So what? So what?
I'll go out and kiss your friends
Like, "Oh my god, get over it"
Yeah, go get drunk so you forget I'm gone
What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two (breaks you in two)
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
What would you do?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
What would you do?
