Song Name: Emily
Dear Emily
I really wanna write this carefully
Now that we're a family
It's only you, your mum and me
Dear Emily
We're gonna live forever happily
I'm gonna ask your mum to marry me
But there's some things you need to know
Your papa was a rolling stone
Playing in a sold-out show, yeah
Taking all the highs and the lows
But living with an empty soul, yeah
And if you ever read the things they wrote
I hope that you can let them go
I was living in a different world
Before I had my little girl, yeah
Emily
When I hear you cry I'll sing you back to sleep
Do you know you inspire all my melodies?
'Cause you make me a better man than I'll ever be, ever be, ever be
Because of you, Emily
Dear Emily
I saw you way before you came to me
'Cause I picked out your name and wrote it on paper
I needed life and life came and gave me Emily (it's all Emily)
Will I be good enough for you?
The truth is I'm afraid of everyone
And anything that could hurt you
Oh, Emily
If you ever feel lonely just sit next to me
Since we brought you home with us, you're everything
'Cause you make me a better man than I'll ever be, ever be, ever be
Because of you, Emily, yeah
Oh, you're all I'll ever need, baby

I've been alive
You're all I'll ever need, oh no, no-no
When I'm looking at your tiny feet
I feel your heartbeat here inside of me
I feel a love that I just can't believe
Oh, Emily
When I hear you cry I'll sing you back to sleep
Oh, do you know you inspire all my melodies?
'Cause you make me a better man than I'll ever be, ever be, ever be
Because of you, Emily
Oh, Emily
If you ever feel lonely just sit next to me
Oh, since we brought you home with us, you're everything, you're everything
And you make me a better man than I'll ever be, ever be, ever be
Because of you, Emily
