Song Name: Angels With Dirty Faces
Angels with dirty faces
Hanging outside my door
New York City, you gave me the life
But you took my heart just to even the score
And I sing all night to a neon light
And the neon shines back to me
So I pull down the shade and call it a day
And I turn up the colour T.V.
Angels with dirty faces
Calling me on the phone
I spent so many years just looking for love
And now they won't leave me alone
And I sing a song but the feeling's gone
Guess I'll go live in L.A.
And pull down the shade and call it a day
On funky old Broadway
Angels calling me up all night
Angels make me want to turn out the light.
