Song Name: Carry It Well
Come home, get high
Forget about the time between a highlights
Yeah, I know, but I'm fine
It's been a rough time
Poker face, in play
All the ways, it makes me think I'm unsafe
Yeah, I know, it's strange
Wish it wasn't this way
But no one seems to know any better
How does end it that way?
I know it seems I have it together
But
Just because I carry it well
Doesn't mean it isn't heavy and I don't need some help
I know I keep it locked down, but all I want now
Is somebody who can tell me how it's gonna turn out
'Cause I thought I'd be doing better by now
I thought I'd be doing better by now
But don't I carry it well?
I'm grateful but impatient
Get hateful, what I'm sayin' is
So those who mean the most who get the best of me
And I can't come back home and fight the rest of me
It's best to leave
'Cause no one seems to know any better
How does end it that way?
I know it seems I have it together
But
Just because I carry it well
Doesn't mean it isn't heavy and I don't need some help
I know I keep it locked down, but all I want now
Is somebody who can tell me how it's gonna turn out
'Cause I thought I'd be doing better by now
I thought I'd be doing better by now
But don't I carry it well?
Don't I carry it well?
'Cause no one seems to know any better
Just because I carry it well
Doesn't mean it isn't heavy and I don't need some help
I know I keep it locked down, but all I want now
Is somebody who can tell me how it's gonna turn out (how it's gonna turn out)
'Cause I thought I'd be doing better by now
I thought I'd be doing better by now
But don't I carry it well?
Don't I carry it well?
'Cause no one seems to know any better
