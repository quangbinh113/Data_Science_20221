Song Name: Stargazing
Think it's time that I should tell you what I've had out on my mind
Every night believing in a movie
Had a feeling i should go and make a move out of my life
Stop running around, pretending that I can go on
I'm out of time
I know, you know, I know
Searching for a live that I believe in
I know, you know, I know
Stargazing
Looking for my life
If you by my side
I know we'll make it some day
Stargazing
Searching through the night
However in my life
I know I'll make it some day
Think it's time that I should tell you what I've had out on my mind
Every night believing in a movie
Had a feeling i should go and make a move out of my life
Stop running around, pretending
Stargazing
Looking for my life
If you by my side
I know we'll make it some day
Stargazing
Searching through the night
However in my life
I know I'll make it some day
Ey oh, say ey oh
You can do whatever you wanna do
Ey oh, say ey oh
You can do whatever you wanna do
I deserve to lead the sky of beautiful
So fulfill in love
Now that I can go on
Get out of line
I know, you know, I know
Searching for the one and find the reason
I know, you know, who know
Stargazing
Looking for my life
If you by my side
I know we'll make it some day
Stargazing
Searching through the night
However in my life
I know I'll make it some day
Ey oh, say ey oh
You can do whatever you wanna do
Ey oh, say ey oh
You can do whatever you wanna do
