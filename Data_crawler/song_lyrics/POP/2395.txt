Song Name: Best Days
So much harder to be honest
With yourself at 20-something
Wish I knew what I'm becoming
And felt the ground while I was on it
Hoping, waiting on a moment
Not knowing if it's coming or it's going, mhm
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (ah, ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
If I had known to feel the fire (fire)
I would've thrown my arms up higher (higher)
Would've held on a little tighter
'Cause you don't know a thing you'll miss 'til it's behind you, mhm
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (ah, ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
What if the best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (ah, ah)
Yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh
