Song Name: Tears
You say I'm not pretty, I'm not anything
Talk me down but I'm not listening
I try so hard then fall apart
Do you realize your dirty words have weight?
Well, they do
My God, I feel the pressure
My God, I'm feeling all the lows
Writing myself this letter
Tell her go dancing on your own
Save all of your tears for later
Go ahead and buy that drink on me
You can do your thing and then you leave
You don't need anybody else
Save all of your tears for later
You got your back that's all you need
Remember that talk is cheap
And you don't need anybody
Keep my head up either way it goes
Now looking in the mirror, I see gold
Cause I've been taking all the love, for myself dress it up
Yeah, I'ma take me home
My God, it's such a blessing
Even if I been on the low
Writing myself this letter
I said, girl, go dancing on your own
Save all of your tears for later
Go ahead and buy that drink on me
You can do your thing and then you leave
You don't need anybody else
Save all of your tears for later
You got your back and that's all you need
Remember that talk is cheap
You don't need anybody
Thank God, I'm doing better
I gotta hand it to myself
I'm so glad I finally told me
Save all of your tears for later
Go ahead buy that drink on me
You can do your thing and then you leave
You don't need anybody else
Save all of your tears for later
You got your back that's all you need
Remember that talk is cheap
You don't need anybody
