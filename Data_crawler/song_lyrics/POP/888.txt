Song Name: Feels Good to Laugh
Counting the moments
Stubbornly
Facing the daylight
Promises broken
But we all make mistakes
When will you come home?
Cause I really really really don't wanna be alone now
Hey, when will you come back?
Oh it feels so good to laugh about it
La la la
Looking for answers
In my fucked up fantasies
Listening backwards
To my records on repeat
When will you come home?
Cause I really really really don't wanna be alone now
Hey, when will you come back?
Oh it feels so good to laugh about it
La la la
