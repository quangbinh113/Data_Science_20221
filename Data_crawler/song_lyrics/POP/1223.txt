Song Name: Save Your Tears (with Ariana Grande) (Remix)
Ooh (ooh)
Nah-nah, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll make you cry when I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (mm)
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
I don't know why I run away (run away, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, boy, I'll make you cry when I run away (away, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I don't know why I run away (bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I'll make you cry when I run away (save)
Save your tears for another day (ooh)
Ooh, girl (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay)
I said save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day
