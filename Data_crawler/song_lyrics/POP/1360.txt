Song Name: Dancing Kizomba
This story starts
With her standing in the spotlight
I never knew
That I could fall in love at first sight
I took her hand
And let her to the danced floor
After one dance
We couldn't let each other go
Oh uh oh
I pulled her in a little closer
Oh uh oh
And we danced a little slower
Oh uh oh
I've never felt this way before
Oh uh oh
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
She lost herself
To the beauty of the music
And I couldn't help
But fall in love without she moves it
Hey DJ
Won't you play this song again
And don't ever stop
'Cause I don't want this moment to end
Oh uh oh
I pulled her in a little closer
Oh uh oh
And we danced a little slower
Oh uh oh
I've never felt this way before
Oh uh oh
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Oh uh oh
I pulled her in a little closer
Oh uh oh
And we danced a little slower
Oh uh oh
I've never felt this way before
Oh uh oh
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
Dancing Kizomba
And we fell in love dancing Kizomba
