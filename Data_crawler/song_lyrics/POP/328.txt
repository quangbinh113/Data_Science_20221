Song Name: Bang Bang
She got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive, oh
You've been waiting for that
Step on up, swing your bat
See, anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah
Bang-bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang-bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Just wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
And wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang-bang, there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back-back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
She might've let you hold her hand in school
But I'ma show you how to graduate (mhm)
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk (hey, hey, hey)
Just come and show me what your mama gave, oh (alright)
I heard you've got a very big (shh)
Mouth, but don't say a thing
See, anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind
Bang-bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang-bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang-bang, there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, backseat of my car (seat of my car), I'll let you have it
Wait a minute, let me take you there (you know what, girls?)
Wait a minute 'til you, ah, hey (let me show you how to do it)
It's Myx Moscato, it's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki Full Throttle, it's oh-oh
Swimming in The Grotto, we winning in the lotto
We dipping in the powder blue, four-door
Kitten so good, it's dripping on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman, robbin' it, bang-bang, cocking it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie and Ari, if they test me, they sorry
Ride his, uh, like a Harley then pull off in his Ferrari
If he hanging, we banging, phone ranging, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing
Uh, B to the A to the N to the G to the-
Uh, B to the A to the N to the G to the, hey
See, anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind
Your mind, hey (okay)
Bang-bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang-bang all over you (bang, bang, bang, bang), I'll let you have it
Wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah-yeah, yeah-uh-huh, ah, hey!)
Bang-bang, there goes your heart (there goes your heart), I know you want it
Back-back seat of my car (back of my car), I'll let you have it
Wait a minute, let me take you there (let me take you there)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang-bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang-bang all over you (all over you, baby)
Yo, I said, bang, bang, bang, b-bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, b-bang, bang
Bang-bang, there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, backseat of my car, I'll let you have it (oh-oh)
Wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
