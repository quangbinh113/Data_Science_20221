Song Name: Forever (feat. Elley Duh√©)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
Yeah, the universe is one big place
It's hard to cut through all the noise
And people tell you just to play it safe
Like you don't even have a choice
I don't know how to belong down here
I don't need to be somebody to some
One day, I know that I'll disappear
So while I'm here
I run the red lights
Just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high
Not even touching the wheel
Drink in the moonlight
And the heaven I feel goes on forever and ever and ever
I run the red lights
Just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high
Not even touching the wheel
Drink in the moonlight
And the heaven I feel goes on forever and ever and ever
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
I know that I am just a drop in the ocean
But I would rather be the waves flowing in and out
To somewhere that I'm the first to go, yeah
What people only dream about
I don't know how to belong down here
I don't need to be somebody to some
One day, I know that I'll disappear
So while I'm here
I run the red lights
Just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high
Not even touching the wheel
Drink in the moonlight
And the heaven I feel goes on forever and ever and ever
I run the red lights
Just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high
Not even touching the wheel
Drink in the moonlight
And the heaven I feel goes on forever and ever and ever
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
(Forever, forever, forever and ever)
