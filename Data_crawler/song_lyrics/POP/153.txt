Song Name: Flashlight - From "Pitch Perfect 2" Soundtrack
When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don'tknow
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight (flashlight)
You're my flashlight (flashlight), you're my flashlight
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me, through the night
(Light, light, light, you're my flashlight)
Light, light, you're my flashlight
Light, light, light, light,
(You're my flashlight, light light)
You're my flash,
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see the sweet life (you and i)
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes (shinin' in my eyes)
Can't lie, it's a sweet life (sweet life)
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight (you're my flashlight)
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, light, light,
You're my flashlight, light, light, yeah yeah
(Light, light, light, you're my flashlight, light, light)
You're my flashlight
