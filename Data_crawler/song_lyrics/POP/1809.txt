Song Name: All Night Parking (with Erroll Garner) Interlude
I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just wanna spend all my time with you (feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone

When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you all night long
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (like, oh my God)
It's so hard to digest, usually I'm best alone
But every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you all night long

Maybe, it's the way you remind me of (where I come from)
Or how you made me feel beautiful (and then some)
The sight of you is dramatic, one glimpse and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you all night long

All night long
All night
