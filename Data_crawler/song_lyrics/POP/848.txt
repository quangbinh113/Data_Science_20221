Song Name: Sunrise
A big golden ball is high in the sky
Shining light get in my eyes but I feel so fine
You grow a flowers in my mind
I don't know why
Please take my hand and get away through this night
I can see the sunshine
I can see the moonlight
With you the sun is rising
With you the moon is shining
Lay down with me till the end of time
Woke up in the night no one here
Pouring rain will make a chance to cover my tears
I know something that I can do
I'm thinking of you
With you my troubles goes away
Light my life
I can see the sunshine
I can see the moonlight
With you the sun is rising
With you the moon is shining
Lay down with me till the end of time
I can see the sunshine
I can see the moonlight
With you the sun is rising
With you the moon is shining
Lay down with me till the end of time
