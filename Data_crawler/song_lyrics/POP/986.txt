Song Name: More Than Friends
Oh, baby, you, you got what I need (yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend, oh you say I'm just a friend
Oh, baby, you, you got what I need, yeah (yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend
I guess we'll never be more than friends
Look, I've had Kylies, Rileys and Holly too (ah)
Only girl I ain't had yet is Y-O-U
If I put a ring on it, would you say, "I do"?
Like the Alicia to my Usher, would you be my boo?
5'3", brown hair, that's the one I need
Cute face, thick thighs, put it all on me
'Cause I'm dying inside, baby, can't you see? (Ugh)
You the one on my mind, take a chance on me
'Cause I was down for the count 'til I met you
Ain't a chance in the world I forget you, no
If my words ever start to upset you
Then I sing you this song just to let you know
You, you got what I need (yeah, yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend, oh, you say I'm just a friend
Oh, baby, you, you got what I need (yeah, yeah), yeah
But you say I'm just a friend
I guess we'll never be more than friends
Never be more than
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I'd rather be forever, -ever, -ever, -ever though
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I'd rather be forever though (yeah, yeah)
So tell me, how for does taking it slow go? (Go)
Said you would pop out (out), but you was a no show, really?
How long until I get one chance? (chance)
Champagne and Drake songs (songs), I need me a one dance, feel me?
You like punk bands, baby, me too (right now)
Bumping three stacks, that's what we do (we do)
When we out in public, you can play like that (haha)
But what we did last summer, can't take that back
'Cause I was down for the count 'til I met you
Ain't a chance in the world I forget you, no
If my words ever start to upset you
Then I sing you this song just to let you know
You (yeah), you got what I need (you do, baby)
But you say I'm just a friend (c'mon), oh you say I'm just a friend
Oh, baby, you, you got what I need (yeah, yeah), yeah
But you say I'm just a friend
I guess we'll never be more than friends
Never be more than
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I'd rather be forever, -ever, -ever, -ever though
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I'd rather be forever though, though
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I'd rather be forever, -ever, -ever, -ever though
Never, never no, never, never, never no
I guess we'll never be more than friends
