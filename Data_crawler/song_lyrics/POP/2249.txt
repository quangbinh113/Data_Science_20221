Song Name: Baby With You
Is it something about me, baby?
I was giving enough attention to you
White lies in the morning, baby, watch out
Life's fast when you're moaning, baby with you
Baby with you (baby, with you)
I said, "Watch out", Wi-Fi isn't working, we don't need that
Spend time just in person, 'cause baby with you
Baby with you
You're an angel, but my mind is full of anger, and you're cancelled
(Still) I don't know why I'm still faithful
Even when we're not together
Let me down enough, I was strong enough to let you wild enough
Lotta DMs, let just see who loud enough
Gotta get me dollar every time you let them miles in love
White lies in the morning, baby, watch out
Life's fast when you're moaning, baby with you
Yeah, baby with you (baby, with you)
I said, "Watch out", Wi-Fi isn't working, we don't need that
Spend time just in person, 'cause baby with you
Oh, baby with you
I know I should be, oh, catching flights not catching feelings
But I'll listen to my heart, 'cause this time might be different
Baby, you should be pouring every single drop of your love on me
Keep me up all night, boy, you got me walking side to side
Is it something about me, baby?
I was giving enough attention to you
White lies in the morning, baby, watch out
Life's fast when you're moaning, baby with you
'Cause baby with you (baby, with you)
Wi-Fi isn't working (turn off the Wi-Fi)
Spend time just in person, 'cause baby with you
Oh, baby with you
Say something in the rain, and if you're in love
Then you will be caught in
(Say something in the rain) say something in the rain, and if you're in love
You'll be out of my mind
Say something in the rain, and if you're in love
Then you'll be coming last
Say something in the rain (say something in the rain)
