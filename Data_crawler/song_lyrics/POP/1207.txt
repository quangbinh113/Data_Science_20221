Song Name: The Joker And The Queen (feat. Taylor Swift)
How was I to know?
It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand
And you still let me win
And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I've been played before
If you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff (but you called my bluff)
And saw through all my tells (and saw through all my tells)
And then you went all in
And we left together
And I know you think that what makes a king is gold
A palace and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
