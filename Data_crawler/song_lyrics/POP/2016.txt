See let's keep it real
We both still young
So what's the rush
The night is young and we not drunk enough
You come around if I don't do too much
We had our downs but we had way more ups
Let's make love
That be the reason that you always hit me up
I swear
You like the way I fuck cause I get rough
You told me your new man don't make you nut
That's a damn shame
You come here, I knock yo pussy out the damn frame
Remember that last time I made you miss yo damn plane
Remember that last time I wet ya down wit champagne
Remember that?
And I know I've been the worst
But I'll love you better
If you let me
Let's catch a flight, change the weather
And I promise forever
All mine

See let's keep it real
If only I could pay the bills with my love for you
We'd be the richest in the fuckin room
We'd be so comfortable
Girl it's only you for me
No lie
I
I've tried they offered, their not who I want them to be
That's not an offer to me
If you're around baby
When you aint wit me you feel alone
And I was wondering if you always know
It don't have to be perfect, I feel like it's worth it
I know now that I've been the worst
But I'll love you better
If you let me
Let's catch a flight, change the weather
And I promise forever
