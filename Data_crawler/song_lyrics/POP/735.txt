Song Name: You Might Be Sleeping
Baby, when you're near
It's warm inside

Sometimes when you stare
Our hearts entwine

And in the morning I'll be here
You might be sleeping without a care
And in the morning I'll be here
You might be dreaming
Play with your hair
When I think about you, boy
My sadness disappears

I could lay around forever
You wipe away my tears
And in the morning I'll be here
You might be sleeping without a care
(Without a care)
