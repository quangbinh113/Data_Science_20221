Song Name: Risky Biz
You say you love me, say I'm the only
Then I watch your eyes turn to somebody else
You buy me flowers, we kiss for hours
Then you fly by night and I'm left on a shelf
I know I'm not supposed to
Be giving all myself to
A shady man with one foot in and one foot out the door but,
You're talking really smooth and
You're acting really cool so
What do I do?
Can't help but play this game with you
Ripped me off and conned a deal
Sold me out but even still
I will take a change betting all I got on you
'Cause you got that look, you got that style
You drive me mad and, you drive me wild
Yeah you make me miss a heartbeat,
Make me weak in the knees
I know you are bad
I know that you are dangerous
I know you are risky biz
I don't expect a 9 to 5
I'll work for nickels and for dimes
'Cause you make me miss a heartbeat,
Make me weak in the knees
You're the boss
And I'm out here just working to live
It's risky biz
You say you'll change but never really try
Again and again I'm asking myself why
'Cause you got that look, you got that style
You drive me mad and, you drive me wild
Yeah you make me miss a heartbeat,
Make me weak in the knees
I know you are bad
I know that you are dangerous
I know you are risky biz
I don't expect a 9 to 5
I'll work for nickels and for dimes
'Cause you make me miss a heartbeat,
Make me weak in the knees
You're the boss
And I'm out here just working to live
It's risky biz
Risky biz,
I'm in
It's called loving you
I know you're risky biz
