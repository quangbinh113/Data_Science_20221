Song Name: Losing You
Yeah, screaming, shouting, press my face through the glass
You don't hear me, see you fading to black
You don't really wanna do this
You know you don't really wanna do this
Yeah, bloodshot, howling, see you scrolling the chat
New light, scowling, rolling panic attacks
You don't really wanna do this
No, I know you don't really wanna do this (I know you don't really wanna)
You're fast asleep, your eyes are open
Catastrophizing every moment
You're tired of going through the motions now
Oh, oh
Hold on one more day
You don't need a break, no
You don't have to hide away
Pay no mind to what they say
Feels like we're standing on the edge so
Stand up, say goodbye
Let me be your lifeline, I won't let you die tonight
If you go down, I'll go down too
Feels like I'm always on the edge of
Lo-losing you
Lo-losing you
I know 'bout you, how you talk to yourself
Shut down, knocked out, feeling safe in yourself
You've been looking for a way out
You know you've been looking for a way out (way out)
My heart beats without asking questions
My body aches, my mind's a weapon
I'm face-to-face with my reflection now
Woah, just
Hold on one more day
You don't need a break, no
You don't have to hide away
Pay no mind to what they say
Feels like we're standing on the edge so
Stand up, say goodbye
Let me be your lifeline, I won't let you die tonight
If you go down, I'll go down too
Feels like I'm always on the edge of
Lo-losing you (feels like I'm always on the edge)
Lo-losing you
Yeah, so I cross my heart and I hope to die
I hurt myself and I don't know why I do
If you go down, I'll go down too
Feels like I'm always on the edge
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
I hurt myself and I don't know why I do
If you go down, I'll go down too
Feels like I'm (always on the edge)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
I hurt myself and I don't know why I do
If you go down, I'll go down too
Feels like I'm always on the edge of
Lo-losing you
Lo-losing you (oh yeah)
Lo-losing you
Lo-losing you
