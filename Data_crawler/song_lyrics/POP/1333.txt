Song Name: Company
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Oh, maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company
Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise, ah
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change
You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me "baby"
Never been around, no pressure
Ain't that serious?
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Oh, maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company
It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh, that ain't doin' too much
You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you "baby"
Never been around, no pressure
Ain't that serious? No
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Oh (Oh), maybe we can be (maybe we can be, yeah), be each other's company
Oh, company
Yeah, yeah
Can we be, can we be, be each other's company
Be each other's company
Oh, just be each other's company
Oh, be each other's company?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Oh, maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company
