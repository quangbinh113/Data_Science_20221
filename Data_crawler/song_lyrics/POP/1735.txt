Song Name: Jealous
You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
I'm nothing special
You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
You know, I'm nothing special
Be with whoever you want
I don't care, I don't care
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me about your problems
If you're not trying to solve them
Don't ask me for my help
Fix it yourself
She tried to call me yesterday
But I didn't pick up
'Cause I don't got time
I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time (no)
Do whatever you want
I don't care, I don't care
Don't even tell me
I don't really wanna know
Don't ask me how's my day's been
I just wanna be alone
Stop talking about your past
I don't wanna hear it
Just leave me alone
Just go
Only care about myself
'Cause everyone's trying to hurt me
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone

Just leave me alone
I just wanna be alone
