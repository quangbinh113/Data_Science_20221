Song Name: 18
Can we go back to 18?
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember, in the summer?
Driving around, you're not around these days (ooh-ooh)
Same paper town feels different now, and I hate (ooh)
Seeing you in every face, it's a memory that I can't shake (shake)
Where are you now and did you get out this place? (This place)
Can we go back to 18?
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember, in the summer of 2013?
Kissing in your backseat
Listening to the A-Team
I should've loved you better
But nothing lasts forever
Driving around, the city is loud these days (ooh-ooh)
This Hollywood town is bringing me down
And I've changed (ooh)
And you can see it on my face
It's a feeling that I just can't shake (shake)
Yeah, I don't know how, I gotta get out this place (this place)
And oh, it's just a dream, I know
Can we go back to 18?
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember, in the summer of 2013?
Kissing in your backseat
Listening to the A-Team
I should've loved you better
But nothing lasts forever
Ooh-ooh-ooh
It's just a dream, I know
It's just a dream, I know
It's just a dream, I
It's just a dream, I
It's just a dream, I
Ooh-ooh-ooh
It's just a dream, I know
It's just a dream, I know
It's just a dream, I
It's just a dream, I
It's just a dream, I
