Song Name: Bikini Bottom
Stop playing with 'em, Riot
How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like...
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
Bitches down bad, they be on my ass, I can hear you hating from the back
Balenciaga baddie got a bag, nigga munching, ate it from the back
Nigga fiending, gotta play it cool, got the jaddy, I'ma make it move
Breaking records, and I'm breaking news, bitch be pressed, like who you?
I get whatever I like, bitches won't bark, but they wanna bite
I got 2 milli' for using a mic', bitch, think about that when you type
She wanna party with Spice, and the body gon' eat, bon app√©tit
Ass on fat, wit' the waist on sleek, ginger hair, pretty calm beat
How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like...
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
Look in the mirror, I'm feeling me
Stacking money where the ceiling be
20 to stand on a couch when out of town, fuck if they feeling me
He like the way that I dress, throw on Balenci' to flex
Like MiMi, I got 'em obsessed
Them bitches see me as a threat, yes
The baddest in the room, so tell 'em to make room
Diamonds glisten on my boob, they gon' listen to my tune
Flow the nicest, but I'm rude, I like niggas, bitches too
Ayy-yo, baddie, what it do? Ayy-yo, Maddie, what it do?
How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like...
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feeling hot, then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
