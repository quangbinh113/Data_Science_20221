I look into the stars at night
The only substitution when it's not your eyes, yeah
Can't get enough, it's official
I want a lot and not a little
If we keep it us, it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be (woo, ooh)
Wherever you arе, wherever you are
20 minutes 'til I'm home
And tell me all the ways you wanna make this go
No, I can't get enough ('nough), it's official (yeah)
You want a lot (yup), and not a little (ayy)
If we keep it us, it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are (oh yeah)
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week (all week, yeah), I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na (mm)
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na (yeah)
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na (ooh)

Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na (yeah)
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat (what you got, I want it like)

All week (oh, ask it)
Wherever you are, wherever you are
