Song Name: Love You Like A Love Song
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
Constantly
Boy you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are
And I want you to know, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
No one compares
You stand alone
To every record I own
Music to my heart
That's what you are
A song that goes on and on
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
I love you like a love song
