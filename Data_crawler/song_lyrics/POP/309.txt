Song Name: Thunderclouds (feat. Sia, Diplo, and Labrinth)
All I need is one
One old man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Please, turn your fears into trust, to trust
Where did love go?
When all is said and done
Hey now I got your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I've never met a girl I could trust
You're sayin' those words
Like you hate me, now (whoa-whoa-oh)
Our house is burning
When you're raised in hell (whoa-whoa-oh)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (ah-ah-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
All I need is love (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is a word (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is us (da-dum, dum, dum)
You turn nouns into verbs, to verbs
Where did love go?
When all is said and...
Hey now put your hands in the air (yeah)
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust (hey, yeah)
You're sayin' those words
Like you hate me, now (whoa-whoa-oh)
Our house is burning
When you're raising hell (whoa-whoa-oh)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (ah-ah-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
These thunderclouds, oh...
These thunderclouds, oh...
These thunder clouds, oh...
