Song Name: Breakaway
Some days we get closer
Things that we never really needed
And things we never thought of keeping safe
I guess it's ever open
If we never gotta changed the change are we
Maybe we should raise a glass
Never think of looking back
We love all the things we have
When we pray for our better days
Maybe we should raise the glass
Taking all the photo back
Remember all the times we had
If we figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
Figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
If we figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
Maybe I was desperate
All my days I was spending on a wasteland
All the nights I was staring at the ceiling, I
Time would pass if we let it
I know we got so much more to give
Maybe we should raise the glass
Never think of looking back
We love all the things we have
When we pray for our better days
Maybe we should raise the glass
Taking all the photo back
Remember all the times we had
If we figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
If we figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
If we figure it all out, we gotta breakaway
For a time like this
We force someone to make
Now where we've got so much more to give
And if we figured it all out
Somehow we gotta
We gotta breakaway
