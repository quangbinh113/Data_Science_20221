Song Name: The Best Is Yet to Come
There's nothin' you could tell me that would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect and there's nothin' I would change
I've seen you on your best days, and I'll see you on your worst
My love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is endin'
Those days where nothin' seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know the last few years have been a test of character
Remind ourselves on darker days, the best is yet to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes, but you were never one
My love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is endin'
Those days where nothin' seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is endin'
Those days where nothin' seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
