Song Name: I Knew I Loved You
Maybe it's intuition
But somethings you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend
I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only a sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for, I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
(Ooh hoo ooo, hoo hoo ooo ooh)
A thousand angels dance around you
(Ooh hoo, hoo ooo, hoo ooo, hoo hoo hoo)
I am complete now that I've found you
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you
I knew I loved you before I met you, I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met
