Song Name: A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do)
A woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't
She can fool around
(Just like you do)
Unless you give her
All the loving she wants
Don't make the mistake
Of thinking old fashioned
Times have changed
From yesterday
No longer will
Those old double standards
Be accepted
By the women of today
So, when you think you've fooled her
She just might be fooling you
Remember: if you can do it
She can, too
Because a woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't
She can fool around
(Just like you do)
Unless you give her
All the loving she wants
When her eyes
Are begging for affection
Don't put her off
Don't make her wait
Don't try to give her
That worn out excuse
About being tired
And working late
I tell ya:
One day you'll come home
Early from work
(Home from work)
Open up the door
And get your feelings hurt
Because she needs it
Yeah
(Just like you do)
A woman's got to have it
Yeah
Just like you
And if you're smart
(Just like you do)
You better stop fooling around
'Cause she will, too
(Just like you do)
(Thinking that she don't)
(Just like you do)
Now, an example to you
Is by the time poor Jack
Returned up the hill:
Somebody else
Had been loving Jill
A woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't
She can fool around
(Yeah)
She will fool around, so
(Just like you do)
You better take out some insurance
And be sure she won't
Give her that love
(Just like you do)
Yeah
That sweet, sweet love
She wants it
Just like you
'Cause she can fool around
(Just like you do)
I tell ya:
She will fool around
With you or without you
Just like you do
A woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't
She can fool around
(Just like you do)
