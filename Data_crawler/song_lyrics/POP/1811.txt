Song Name: The Way I Love You
Mmh, mmh
We've yelled words we shouldn't
We fought for the best
Those tears we were crying, both happy and sad
Oh, time, it stops and people fade when you step in a room
I don't love anyone the way I love you
We don't fear the silence
You read like a book
I'd last a decade on one of those looks
I would give the ocean up to swim in your blues
I don't love anyone the way I love you
The way I love you
The way I
If I know what love is, it's because of you
You light my fire, yeah, that's the whole truth
I know it's easy to get lost in all of the issues
I'll tell the whole world, top of my lungs
Past, present, future, they know you're the one
Doesn't take a diamond ring to say that I do
I don't love anyone
No, I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone the way I love you
Mmh, mmh
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Mmh, mmh
Mmh, mmh
