Song Name: Beautiful Stranger
Hmm, mmh
Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Looked up at me and my dark curly hair
Looked back for a second didn't want to be rude
I tend to fall in love on the tube
Hmm, mmh
Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Reading the newspaper, stuck to his chair
I swore that he smiled and I felt my heart drop
Heard the doors open, came to my stop
Hmm, mmh
What if I hadn't left the train at Ladbroke Grove would I know his name?
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairytale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
Hmm, mmh
Beautiful stranger catching my stare
It's fate we collided right then back there
I wonder if he felt the same thing too
Innocent crush on the morning commute
Hmm, mmh
What if I would've stayed on the train?
Dared to stand up and ask for his name
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairytale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
Hmm, mmh
My beautiful stranger will have to remain
A love that came and left with this train
My beautiful stranger
