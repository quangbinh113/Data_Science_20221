Song Name: Wishing You a Good Life
Forever
Seemed written in the stars
I never
Dreamed we would fall so far
But now you say you gotta be free
And that if we were meant to be
That love would find a way to bring us back
Together-gether
Well if you need to go, I would never make stay
But it breaks my heart to throw it all away
Gonna dry my eyes and fake a smile
And try to move on from these
Bittersweet memories
I'm wishing you a good life
I hope you will remember
The love, the joy, the happiness
The way we used to be
And as we say our goodbyes
Let's not look back in anger
I'll always be a part of you
You were a part of me
No, I can't deny it
That sometimes I feel like crying
But I'll make it through
I pray you
Find what you're looking for
And someday you
Won't have to search no more
But now it's time I move along
Cuz the beat goes on and on
Gotta find a way to put it back together-gether
Well there's times you win, and there's times
You're gonna lose
And it seems this time the cards spell deuces
Wanna take this chance to thank you for giving
Me the best years
All those sweet memories
I'm wishing you a good life
I hope you will remember
The love, the joy, the happiness
The way we used to be
And as we say our goodbyes
Let's not look back in anger
I'll always be a part of you
You were a part of me
No, I can't deny it
That sometimes I feel like crying
But I'll make it through
Well I hope someday, baby we will find
That it wasn't just a waste of time
If all your dreams come true, there's just one
Thing I'd ask of you
Keep me, in your memory
I'm wishing you a good life
I hope you will remember
The love, the joy, the happiness
The way we used to be
And as we say our goodbyes
Let's not look back in anger
I'll always be a part of you
You were a part of me
No, I can't deny it
That sometimes I feel like crying
But I'll make it through
