Song Name: Sing Me to Sleep
Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for ya
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
Any-anytime
I would do-do-do-do-do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-day
Any-anytime
I would do-do-do-do-do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-day
