Song Name: Everyone Can See
(One, two, three, four)
Its been a while since I've seen you, of course it's like this
Been keepin' busy tryna make it, but I can't dismiss
Every time I'm with the homies I think about you
I have no choice but to ignore it like I do
I can't erase it, I can't erase what's on my mind
I gotta figure out a way to last the night
I don't wanna let you go
I just hate it when it shows
You just mean that much to me
I think everyone can see
And it would only take a heartbeat to let you back in
I wanna call ya, wanna ask ya, "How have you been?"
But I know you're on your own trip, I guess we all are
I have no choice but to watch ya from afar
I can't erase it, I can't erase what's on my mind
I gotta figure out a way to last the night
I don't wanna let you go
I just hate it when it shows
You just mean that much to me
I think everyone can see
I can't erase it, I can't erase what's on my mind
I gotta figure out a way to pass the time
I don't wanna let you go
I just hate it when it shows
You just mean that much to me
I think everyone could see
