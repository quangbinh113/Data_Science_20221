Song Name: Black Widow
I'm gonna love you, until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you, what's really crazy
You should've known better, than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby
This twisted cat and mouse game, always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nuttin' to somethin', likin' to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fuckin'?
It's like I loved you so much that now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might-might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now, you've got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...
You used to be, thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby now rest in peace (it's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you, until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show you (show 'em what? Show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (it's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby
Black, black widow, baby
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doin' whatever works
You had never meet nobody, that'll do ya how I do ya
That'll bring ya to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
That'll make ya beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'd do any and every thing for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air, and you lean forward
'Til you have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I want it
Promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here a fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want sh-
You used to be, thirsty for me (right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby now rest in peace (it's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you, until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show you (show 'em what? Show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better, than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby
Bla-bla-black, black widow, baby
