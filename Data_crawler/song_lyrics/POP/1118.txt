Song Name: Not In The Mood (feat. Fivio Foreign & Kay Flock)
Uh, yeah

Baow
Really not in the mood right now
Hennessy got me boozed right now
Mama told me to stack my chips
Feelin' like I can't lose right now (uh)
I see niggas keep playin' these games
They must got us confused right now
Straight to the top, this ain't never gon' stop (uh, huh)
I got somethin' to prove right now (yeah)
Yeah, look, this .40'll do it (baow)
It don't even matter who shootin', huh (nah)
They gettin' mad at the movement (uh)
You got a problem what we doin'? (Uh)
I saw niggas love (I saw niggas love)
And I saw niggas hate, huh (and I saw niggas hate)
I thought niggas real (I thought niggas real)
But I know niggas fake (grrt, baow)
Look, .45, that's on the waist (huh)
If they come, I do the chase (skrrt)
I couldn't breathe, runnin' from the jakes (nah)
I almost gave up every other day, huh (ayy, ayy)
We made a way, huh (we made a way)
We not the same, we never relate (nah)
It's a big food for the plate
It's time to go drill, I never do dates (grrt, baow)
I keep a knocker, I ain't come to play
Niggas be suckin' on me like they gay
But let someone run up on me, I'ma spray
I got a green dot on my pole
Still, finna hit him if he run away
I heard a couple hunnid on my soul
But they see me and look the other way
I don't promote but heavy on the gang shit
If you think I'm lackin', then you brainless
Hunnid K up on my neck
A nigga try to front it, I'ma make 'em famous
Otherwise, I ain't finna entertain it
You should get the picture I done painted
I don't go nowhere without my stainless
They know my body, I be movin' dangerous
Really not in the mood right now
Hennessy got me boozed right now
Mama told me to stack my chips
Feelin' like I can't lose right now
I see niggas keep playin' these games
They must got us confused right now
Straight to the top, this ain't never gon' stop
I got somethin' prove right now
Grrt, baow
DOA, we got the city on lock (city on lock)
Backdoor season, better have your knocks (grrah, baow)
It don't matter which
Still get shot with your bitch if you like it or not (if you like it or not)
Like, let's lace your kicks
Don't run, don't trip when I walk in the spot, like (don't run, don't trip)
Got the drop, you get smacked with the pole for thinkin' that he hot, like (pussy)
I'm with Setty (like)
Ayo Fivi' (Fivi')
Where the wettys? (Where the wettys?)
He tried to run in the store (like)
I ain't showin' remorse (grrah), he get shot in the deli (grrah)
Face shot, no belly
Layup, no jelly
I know they that mad they freed me
I ran up a milli', know they should've kept me (grrah, grrah-grrah)
Really not in the mood right now (nah)
Hennessy got me boozed right now (grrt, baow)
Mama told me to stack my chips (baow)
Feelin' like I can't lose right now (grrt)
I see niggas keep playin' these games (baow)
They must got us confused right now (uh)
Straight to the top, this ain't never gon' stop (grrah, grrah, grrah)
I got somethin' to prove right now (grrt, baow)
Hahaha
Ayy, y'all fuckin' with them niggas?
Grrt, baow
