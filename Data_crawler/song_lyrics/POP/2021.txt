Song Name: Left and Right (Feat. Jung Kook of BTS)
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)
Ever since the-the day you you ran away (no, I don't know how)
How to erase your body from out my brain (what ya gon' do now?)
Maybe I should just focus on me instead (you're all I think about)
All the nights we were tangled up in your bed
Oh, no (oh, no) oh, no (oh, no)
You're going 'round in circles
Got you stuck up in my head, yeah
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind
Your love stays with me day and night
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)
Ever since the-the day that you went away (someone tell me how)
How much more do I gotta drink for the pain? (What ya gon' do now?)
You do things to me that I just can't forget (you're all I think about)
All the nights we were tangled up in your bed
Oh, no (oh, no) oh, no (oh, no)
You're going 'round in circles
Got you stuck up in my head, yeah
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (of my mind)
Your love stays with me day and night
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)
Did you know you're the one that got away?
And even now, baby, I'm still not okay
Did you know that my dreams, they're all the same?
Every time I close my eyes
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)
Your love stays with me day and night
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)

I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind (what ya gon' do now?)
