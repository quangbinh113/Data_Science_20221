Song Name: Only Love Can Hurt Like This - Slowed Down Version
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I tell myself, you don't mean a thing
And what we got, got no hold on me
But when you're not there, I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die, 'til I feel your touch
Only love
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Say I wouldn't care if you walked away (oh-ooh)
But every time you're there, I'm begging you to stay
When you come close (when you come close), I just tremble
And every time, every time you go (go)
It's like a knife that cuts right through my soul
Only love
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this
But it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture
Makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt like this)
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt)

Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt this
And it must have been a deadly kiss
