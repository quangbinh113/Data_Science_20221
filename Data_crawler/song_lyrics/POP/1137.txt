Song Name: Promises
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
Don't hide from me, I'm not here to love myself
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
And don't lie to me, I'm not here to trust myself
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
Do you ever wonder why it's never in our hands? Oh-oh
Do you ever wonder why it's never in our hands?

It's not my fault that you feel alone
I've kept my promises, I might be gone
All by myself, I've been holding on
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
There was a time that we, we could really lose ourselves
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
I think you were made for me, we're not here to choose ourselves
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
Do you ever wonder why it's never in our hands? Yeah, oh, yeah
Do you ever wonder why it's never in our hands? Oh
It's not my fault that you feel alone
I've kept my promises, I might be gone
All by myself, I've been holding on
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
All by myself, I've been holding on
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
Can't make no promises, I'll still be home
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
(Can't make no promises, yeah)
