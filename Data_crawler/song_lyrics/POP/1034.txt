Song Name: I Blame The World
Why fall in love if I fall out?
Why get high if eventually everyone comes down?
Why play the game if it ain't fair?
Why talk to God if I ain't got any proof He's even there?
And why say "hi" if I gotta say "bye" someday?
And why get close if I know my heart could break?
Can't see the good in all the bad
Can't make me happy when I'm sad
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Can't see the silver in the lines
Can't make the best of a bad time
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Why paint my nails if they chip off?
Why try to find myself if I know I'll end up gettin' lost?
And why say "hi" if I gotta say "bye" someday?
And why get close if I know my heart could break?
Can't see the good in all the bad
Can't make me happy when I'm sad
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Can't see the silver in the lines
Can't make the best of a bad time
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Oh, I wanna run away
Oh, I wanna run away
Can't see the good in all the bad
Can't make me happy when I'm sad
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Can't see the silver in the lines
Can't make the best of a bad time
I blame the world
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl

I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Oh, I wanna run away
I'm a glass half empty kinda girl
Oh, I wanna run away
