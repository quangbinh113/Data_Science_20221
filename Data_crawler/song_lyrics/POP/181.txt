Song Name: Wicked Game - Live In Turku
The world was on fire, no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you
I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
And I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
...With you
What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you
I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
And I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
...With you
World was on fire, no-one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
No and I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I'll never dream that I lose somebody like you, no
I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
And I wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
...With you
Nobody loves no one
