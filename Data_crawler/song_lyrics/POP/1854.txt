Song Name: Crash & Burn
(Right until I crash and)
See that you're doing well
Working hard on yourself
Really happy for you
If you couldn't tell
It's been hard since we fell
But I'll keep that to myself
Cause it's not like I've been going through hell
I haven't felt the aftershock I'm supposed to
But I'll do anything to not have to
So I'll party till it all goes away
Hoping to forget your name
Anything to numb the pain
I'll just keep on running from the part where it hurts
And I don't want to hit reverse
Say the road I'm taking works
Right until I crash and burn
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Right until I crash and burn
Into all my feelings
Get my demons screaming
Hear my pulse increasing
Ah ah ah
Throw me in a whirlwind
Pull me out the deep end
Just to keep repeating
Ah ah ah
Cuz I know I'm headed for disaster
If I keep on saying it doesn't matter
Play it down but my heart's about to shatter
I'll worry about it after
Oh I
I'll party till it all goes away
Hoping to forget your name
Anything to numb the pain
I'll just keep on running from the part where it hurts
And I don't want to hit reverse
Say the road I'm taking works
Right until I crash and burn
Ah-ah ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Right until I crash and burn
Ah-ah ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Ah-ah ah ah ah
Right until I crash and burn
Swear to god that I'm okay
Nothing that my heart can't take
Anything to numb the pain
Right until I crash and
Swear to god that I'm okay
Nothing that my heart can't take
Anything to numb the pain
Right until I crash and burn
