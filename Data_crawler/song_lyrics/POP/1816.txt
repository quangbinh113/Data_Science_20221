Song Name: Not Alone - from Devotion
Another step on your own
Another mile that you've flown
And I've been right by your side
There's so much more than you see
Like the wind that blows through the trees
Or the time that's passing by
I see the tears, they're rollin' down but they're not here to stay
I know you're starin' at the clouds, tryna wish them away
When you call the stars, know I'm callin' out your name
(Ooh)
You are not alone (ooh)
I watch over you, ooh (ooh)
Won't let you go, you gotta know, you're not alone (ooh)
You are not alone (ooh)
I watch over you, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Won't let you go, you gotta know, you're not alone
I didn't give you the wings to not go fly
And don't you know this ain't goodbye
'Cause everything I am is who you are
Who you are
Sometimes it hurt, don't know how to be here
Sometimes you question if anything's real
But you call the stars, you're callin' out my name
You, ooh, ooh-ooh, you
You are not alone
I watch over you, ooh-ooh, ooh
Won't let you go, you gotta know, you're not alone
You are not alone
I watch over you, ooh-ooh, ooh
Won't let you go, you gotta know, you're not alone
