Song Name: Hear Me Now
If you get to hear me now
I know you'll get stronger
When you get older, oh
Just don't shrug your shoulders
When you get older, oh
The things aren't easy
So just believe me now

If you don't keep it cool now
You'll never make a sound
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
Leave excuses aside
Speak out your mind, no
And don't let it slide
You're not always right, no
The things aren't easy
So just believe me now
Don't learn the hard way
Just let me show you how
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
