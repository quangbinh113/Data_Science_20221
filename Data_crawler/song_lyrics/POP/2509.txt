Song Name: Questions
How, where, when, why
Did it all go wrong?
Who, where, when, why
Did I get it wrong?
In the midnight hour, I'm restless
Lately, I can't sleep at night
'Cause you threw me in a spiral
And I need some peace of mind
If you don't ask questions then you won't know why
Like, "Where's the moon all day, or where's the sun at night?"
Like, "Why, if we're so broke, can't we turn back time?"
I wonder why, ooh, ooh
If you don't ask questions, then you won't know why
Like, "How is this so easy when you say goodbye?"
Like, "How am I supposed to live without you in my life?"
I wonder why, ooh-ooh, ooh
So I asked myself
How, where, when, why
Did it all go wrong?
Who, where, when, why
Did I get it wrong?
So wrong, so wrong
Did I get it wrong? (Wrong, was I wrong?)
Did I get it wrong?
I know I should have the answers
But my head was in the clouds
Should've listened to your warnings
Just look at where it's left me now
If you don't ask questions, then you won't know why
Like, "Where's the moon all day, or where's the sun at night?"
Like, "Why, if we're so broke, can't we turn back time?"
I wonder why, ooh, ooh
If you don't ask questions, then you won't know why
Like, "How is this so easy when you say goodbye?"
Like, "How am I supposed to live without you in my life?"
I wonder why, ooh-ooh, ooh
So I asked myself
How, where, when, why
Did it all go wrong?
Who, where, when, why
Did I get it wrong?
So wrong, so wrong
Did I get it wrong?
So wrong, so wrong
Did I get it wrong?
