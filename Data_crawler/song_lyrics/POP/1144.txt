Song Name: Love (Sweet Love)
Oh
I've been waiting patiently like all my life, yeah
Nobody ever seems to get it right
It's like I'm the only one who knows just what I like
What can I say? I just can't help it
Tonight I'm feelin' selfish (oh)
What I do shouldn't phase you, no
It's just human nature, yeah
Do I invalidate ya?
I don't need your love to love me (uh)
Need my own celebration, yeah
Solo stimulation, yeah
Kiss my imagination
I don't need your love to love
I been spendin' time on everybody else
It's time I did it for me (love, sweet love)
Oh, baby
Never kept my magic all to myself
So now I'm gon' give it to me
When it's said and done
I'm gonna show me some
Love, sweet love
I'm gon' give it to, give me some of that
Love, sweet love
Yeah, I'm gonna give it to me, give me some of that
Love, sweet love
Yeah, I'm gon' give it to, give me some of that
Love, sweet love
I'm gonna show me some (ow)
Now I think I should spend a little more time on me (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I like him, but he ain't nothin' but a guy to me, oh, no (guy to me)
So me and my tips gonna get me all I need
What can I say? I just can't help it
Tonight I'm feelin' selfish
What I do shouldn't phase you, no
It's just human nature, yeah (yeah)
Do I invalidate you?
I don't need your love to love me (uh)
Be my own celebration, yeah
Solo stimulation, yeah
Use my imagination
I don't need your love to love
I been spendin' time on everybody else
It's time I did it for me (me) (love, sweet love)
Oh, baby (yeah, yeah)
Never kept my magic all to myself (all to myself)
So now I'm gon' give it to me (give it to me)
When it's said and done (give it to me)
