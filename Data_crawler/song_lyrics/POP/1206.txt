Song Name: Love You
Oh baby, do you wanna hold me?
Come closer, I want you my lady
I know you're never gonna love me
Oh your touch feels like in the 80's
Baby I don't wanna love you, love you
Tell me do you wanna something new
All this time I do, I do
Share my mind
So baby I don't wanna love you, love you
Tell me do you wanna something new
All this time I do, I do
Share my mind
Oh baby, do you wanna hold me?
Come closer, I want you my lady
I know you're never gonna love me
Oh your touch feels like in the 80's
Baby I don't wanna love you, love you
Tell me do you wanna something new
All this time I do, I do
Share my mind
So baby I don't wanna love you, love you
Tell me do you wanna something new
All this time I do, I do
Share my mind
