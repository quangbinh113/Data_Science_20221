Song Name: One Right Now (with The Weeknd)
Na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na, oh no
Yeah, yeah
Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (oh!)
You think it's so easy fucking with my feelings
I got one coming over and one right now (uh)
One right now
(One right now, one right now, oh-oh-oh)
I got one coming over and one right now
Said you want to have my babies
I fucked you so good, you should pay me
Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong
(When you did me so wrong)
But I got over what you did already
Body for body, so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad"
Baby, Herm√®s, but you dropped the bag
Baby, truth is, maybe one's just not enough
You say you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (that he fucked you on)
You think it's so easy fucking with my feelings (feelings)
I got one coming over and one right now (uh)
One right now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(One right now, one right now, oh yeah)
I got one coming over and one right now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(One right now, one right now, oh-oh-oh)
I got one coming over and one right now
You're a stain in my legacy
We can't be friends, can't be family (oh)
You probably fuck all my enemies (ooh)
I can't let you be next to me
Oh, you belong to the world now
So just leave me alone now
We're not in touch no more
You say you love me, but I don't care (no, I don't care)
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (oh)
You think it's so easy fucking with my feelings (feelings)
I got one coming over and one right now
One right now (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Fucking with my, fucking with my feelings)
I got one coming over and one right now
(Ooh-yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah)
(One right now)
I got one coming over and one right now
(Hey!)
(One right now, one right now)
(Ooh-yeah)
I got one coming over and one right now
