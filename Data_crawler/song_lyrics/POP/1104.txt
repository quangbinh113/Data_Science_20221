Song Name: Come For Me (Unlocked) (feat. Khalid & Lucky Daye)
Look me in my eye, know you know the vibe
In you, I confide something I can't hide
Tell me what it's worth, I put in the work
You know I'm the one that you prefer
But you hit a nerve
Yeah
Look me in my face (yeah)
Tell me what's the case (yeah)
It's all in my head (yeah)
Everything you say (yeah)
Are you good now?
Are you staying 'round?
I just wanna know what that's about
Is it too much to need someone to come for me?
Just need someone to run to me
I need someone to come for me
And that'll be enough for me
Why you bring me up (why?)
Just to bring me down? (Yeah)
Yeah, you bring me up (yeah)
Just to bring me down (yeah)
Why you bring me up
Just to bring me down?
Yeah, you bring me up
Just to bring me down
Loving you out loud
There will be no doubt
Gotta love me loud
Let it drive you wild (please tell me)
It's the pretty brown, brown
Make me feel away
Make me proud, proud
Every word you say to me
In the end, I gotta say a prayer for ya
After all, you know that I'll be there for ya
I wish I could show you how I care for ya, for ya
Is it too much to need someone to come for me?
Just need someone to run to me
I need someone to come for me
And that'll be enough for me
Why you bring me up (why?)
Just to bring me down? (Yeah)
Yeah, you bring me up (yeah)
Just to bring me down (yeah)
Why you bring me up
Just to bring me down?
Yeah, you bring me up
Just to bring me down
Bring me up to bring me down (why you bring me)
Why do you bring me up (why you bring me)
To bring me down? (Yeah)
Why do you bring me up (bring me up, bring me up)
To bring me down? (Bring me down, bring me up)
Why do you bring me up (bring me down, bring me up)
To bring me down? (Bring me down)
Tell me why
(Why, tell me why, oh-oh, tell me why, please)
(Oh, why, why why why, why, why, why, why)
Tell me why
(Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why)
(Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, ooh-ooh)
Tell me why
(Oh, why, why, why, why, tell me why, tell me why, why don't you just)
Tell me why
(Oh, oh, tell me why, tell me, tell me)
