Song Name: So What
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na
I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight!
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
Uh, check my flow, uh
The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps, shit
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I wanna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
He's gonna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
We're all gonna get in a fight
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
You never were
You want it all
But that's not fair
I gave you life
I gave my all
You weren't there
You let me fall
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done (We're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)
No no, no no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)
Woo-hoo
Ba-da-da-da, da-da
