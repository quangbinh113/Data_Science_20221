Song Name: Bitch (I Said It)
I tried to call you today
To apologise for your mistakes
I guess I'm just so used to it
Being the one that's in the wrong
And taking all the blame
I'm glad you didn't pick up
I swear to God, I'm better off
I'd probably be too scared to say it to your face but anyway
I'll text it you instead, yeah
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is, bitch
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is
I'm done with all of the games
You're just a waste of space in my brain
I'm just so, over it, but I'll admit, it hurts a little bit
When I hear your name
And it's such a shame, mm
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is, bitch
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is, bitch
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is, bitch
I know I said it but I don't regret it
'Cause you're still so pathetic, yeah
I really meant it
And I wish I could change you, but
I fucking hate you
And it's time that someone told you how it is
Ugh, you're such a bitch
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (bitch)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, bitch
