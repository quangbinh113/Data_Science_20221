Song Name: Cake By The Ocean
Mm, na-na, ayy
(Cake by the ocean)
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl, why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah-ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (huh)
But you're moving so carefully, let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh

Goddamn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, "Yes ma'am"
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah-ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (huh)
But you're moving so carefully, let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Ooh, ah-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Ooh, ah-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
You're fucking delicious
Talk to me, girl
Talk to me, baby (talk to me, baby)
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy (that's right)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, huh
