Song Name: OPEN A WINDOW (feat. Tyler, The Creator)
Can I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore
Stuck here and I never seem to get away, but I'll hang on
Seasons change but you don't ever, oh
Oh, soon as I can see your face, I'm fine I'm sure
I'm tryna find a way to get out
So can I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore
Fuck this, I might leave the people tellin' me what I should do
They want change, but you don't ever, oh
Oh, tryin' to ignore the thought of wantin' to
But every single time that I do, I'm like, uhm
Could I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore, no
Yeah, so what the fuck?
Niggas feelin' stuck, really feelin' stuck
Like the middle car on freeway pile up with semi-trucks
Open door, but you can't
Try to run, but you pant
Out of breath, you can't vent
'Cause the AC actin' up
Nah, really, if somethin' feelin' dirty to me
At the roots like a tree, see, I just up and I leave
It ain't pertainin' to me, I don't engage, I don't care
They like, "You get it?", I'm like, "Yeah", and get the fuck out of here
See, I concur, I'm modest, I'm Tyler, I'm honest
I never bite my tongue, it's for the better, I promise
You stuck, then move, because I'm running, like sinus
I knows, they quiet like that last E in "silence"
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore
No
