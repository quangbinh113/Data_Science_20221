Song Name: barcelona
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali alone
I'm jealous of that whole damn city
That's making you forget me
Don't know if you'll ever come home
I'm jealous of the Spanish wine
On the lips that should be mine
Got you spilling the secrets I told
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali alone
I'm just waking up, you're out with your friends
Did you tell them 'bout the boy that you met?
Are you still in love, or did you forget?
All the clubbing must be clouding your head
The city is holding you
The way that I wanted to
Yeah, it's laughing in my face
You got on a plane and it took you away
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali alone
I'm jealous of that whole damn city
That's making you forget me
Don't know if you'll ever come home
I'm jealous of the Spanish wine
On the lips that should be mine
Got you spilling the secrets I told
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali, crying in Cali alone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) just come home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
While I'm crying in Cali, crying in Cali alone (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Did you lose your phone? 'Cause you disappeared
Couple days and, darling, it feels like years
I try to move on, my heart interferes
Wouldn't have to, honey, if you were here
The city is holding you (the city is holding you)
The way that I wanted to (the way that I wanted to)
Yeah, It's laughing in my face (in my face)
You got on a plane and it took you away
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali alone
I'm jealous of that whole damn city
That's making you forget me
Don't know if you'll ever come home
I'm jealous of the Spanish wine
On the lips that should be mine
Got you spilling the secrets I told
I'm jealous of Barcelona
'Cause it's getting to know you
While I'm crying in Cali, crying in Cali alone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) just come home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
While I'm crying in Cali, crying in Cali alone (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
