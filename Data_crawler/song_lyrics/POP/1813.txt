Song Name: All For You
Wakin' up, there's a storm outside
We layin' here with nothin' to do
I wish you'd open and say what's on your mind
And you would know all I wanted was you
If you could only see you through my eyes
You'd see you're
Worthy of the light, you bring that blocks out the darkness
And if you really needed some space to find who are
You can take it
And I'll love you until your heart breaks
Until you can open and see
I want you with all your mistakes, my girl
I'm fallin' in you, would you fall into me too?
I never thought much of who I was
'Til you came around and made me believe
You showed me that, there's beauty in this world
I wanna give you what you gave to me
If only you could only see you through my eyes
You'd see you're
Worthy of the light, you bring that blocks out the darkness
And if you really needed some space to find who are
You can take it
And I'll love you until your heart breaks
Until you can open and see
That I want you with all your mistakes, my girl
I'm fallin' in you, would you fall into me too?
And the hardest places you have to go
You don't have to be alone
When you're scared and lost, and on your own
I'll cary you back home
Oh, oh, oh, 'cause it's all for you, babe
It's all for you
'Cause it's all for you, babe
Ooh, it's all for you
'Cause it's all for you, babe
Ooh, it's all for you
Mm-hmm
And I'll love you until your heart breaks
Until you can open and see
That I want you with all your mistakes, my girl
I'm fallin' in you, would you fall into me too?
'Cause I'm fallin' in you
Would you fall into me too?
