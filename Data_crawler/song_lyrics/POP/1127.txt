Song Name: Sobriety
Ma'am, I'm gon' need you to uh, pee in this cup

Alright
Xanny, packed in my Off-White fanny
I been going off, I'm manic
Shit wearing off, I'm landing
More on the way, don't panic, oh-oh
Drank too much, god, damn it (damn)
Shut that door, don't slam it
Shit too loud, can't stand it
I can't stand it
Wasted, hiding in the basement
Careful when you do me wrong
I don't ever chase shit
Life is what you make it
They say that when you make it
How I gonna turn it off? All these expectations
I got anxiety, they told me the pill should've helped me
But I think they lied to me
Motherfucking mess, I don't fit in society
Demons inside of me, fuck my sobriety
I got anxiеty, no, I won't piss in no cup
Know that my liver is fucked
Know that we living it up
Fuck my sobriеty, fuck my sobriety, fuck my sobriety
Sing me a motherfucking lullaby
Hard as I'm trying, not tryna to die
Spirits, I'm tryna hide
Wide awake, thinking 'bout suicide
Suicide, on the line, on my mind
Bitch, I can't sleep, I'm in the deep end
Fuck the Z's, unless it's O-Z's then
I got anxiety, they told me the pill should've helped me
But I think they lied to me
Motherfucking mess, I don't fit in society
Demons inside of me, fuck my sobriety
I got anxiety, no, I won't piss in no cup
Know that my liver is fucked
Know that we living it up
Fuck my sobriety, fuck my sobriety, fuck my sobriety
I know I might seem like a mess and
I got some heavy obsessions
Depression ain't easy, but I'm just confessing
I'm sick of pretending
I'm sick, but I'm mending
I'm probably offending some bitches with stitches, they all sacrilegious
So I'm saying, "Fuck them" (fuck my sobriety) I'm saying, "Fuck them"
I got anxiety, fuck my sobriety
Go 'head, put that shit in variety (bitch)
