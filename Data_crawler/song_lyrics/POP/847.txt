Song Name: Burgundy Red
Burgundy
Like old times passing by
Is the color of the tides
Sweet memories comfort me
And give me the light
Burgundy
Like glooming in your eyes
Is the color of the night
When the waves rhymes, repeatedly
Oh, this is the sign
Alright, let's surf on the time
Only we own the ride tonight
Maybe we could come find out
Secrets in burgundy red sky
Burgundy
Like old times passing by
Is the color of the tides
Sweet memories comfort me
And give me the light
Burgundy
Like glooming in your eyes
Is the color of the night
When the waves rhymes, repeatedly
Oh, this is the sign
Alright, let's surf on the time
Only we own the ride tonight
Maybe we could come find out
Secrets in burgundy red sky
Alright, let's surf on the time
Only we own the ride tonight
Maybe we could come find out
Secrets in burgundy red sky
