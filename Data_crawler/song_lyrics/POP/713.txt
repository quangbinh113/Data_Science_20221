Song Name: These Nights
Come on over
Oh pretty lover
It's the dead of the night
And we hardly know each other
Don't you worry
I'll be waiting with the lights kept dim
The many colors in your eyes they
Make me weak they make me high start to hypnotize
I think I've fallen for her spell once again
Don't wanna stop this feeling
You make it so hard to resist
I hear to voice of the demons
Running around inside my head
Don't know if I can believe in
All these love songs and fairytales
I can't help this feeling
These nights never seem to end
Come on over
Oh pretty lover
It's the dead of the night
And you need a little comfort
Don't you worry
Let's run wild live like we've never lived
We'll find a way to
Forget everything
Let's cover up the mess we wrote
Intoxicated by her spell once again
