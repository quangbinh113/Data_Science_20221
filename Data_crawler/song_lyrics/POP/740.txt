Song Name: Little Joy
Would it be too much?
If I ask you
How do you do?
How your day went by
Or maybe just a simple hi
Wouldn't it be nice, if we live side by side?
Walking hand in hand
Life will be a little joy
Hi, it's been a while
Since I was five and had a smile
You bring so much joy and made my life a little joy
Wouldn't it be nice, if we live side by side?
Walking hand in hand, life will be a little joy
Wouldn't it be nice, if we live side by side?
Walking hand in hand, life will be a little joy
