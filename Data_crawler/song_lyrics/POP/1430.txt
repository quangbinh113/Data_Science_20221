Song Name: Talk (feat. Disclosure)
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're going
Before we get lost, lend me me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm moving too far
Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're going
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wanting more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me something I ain't heard before
Oh, I've been dreaming about it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinking about it
Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're going
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowing (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm moving too far
Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're going
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock
Oh, you've been dreaming 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinking 'bout it
Can we just talk?
(Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're going
Before we get lost, let me out first
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm moving too far
Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're going
Figure out where we're going
