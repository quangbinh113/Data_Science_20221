Song Name: Island Island
Feels like I'm in a dream alone
Trying to keep myself
Just not to regret
I don't belong to this city on fire
I think that I can find
My own place tonight
Feels like I could be strong enough
To make it by myself
Oh yeah I'll be free
I don't belong to this city of liars
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Cause I'm having
A dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
A dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
Feels like I could be strong enough
To make it by myself
Oh yeah I'll be free
I don't belong to this city of liars
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Cause I'm having
A dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
A dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
Always
I'll always keep my dream alive
Until I find the way you're on
Always
I'll always keep my dream alive
Until I find the way you're on
Dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
A dream like eternity
A longing for liberty
Feels like I can go anywhere tonight
