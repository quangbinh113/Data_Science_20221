Song Name: Don't Tell My Mom
Daddy just cut your hair today, didn't he?
Yeah
Do you like it?
No, I cried
You did cry a little bit
I cried
Sweetie, will you come home?
We're tracking your car
Who are you with? What are you on?
Pick up the phone
When I was young
My problems were her problems
Now, I don't wanna 'cause trouble at all
I don't want the call
Sayin', "We're worried about you, we're worried about you"
Don't worry about me, just worry about you
So, don't tell my mom, I'm fallin' apart
She hurts when I hurt, my scars are her scars
She'll talk to her friends, impress all of them
At least in her mind, hеr daughter is fine
Oh, pleasе (please) don't (don't) let (let) her hear
I'm dyin' inside
'Cause she's dealt (dealt) with (with) this (this) for years
I got it this time
I wait 'til I'm home
Cry in the shower for two to three hours
'Til the tears are gone
Then pick up the phone
Now when we speak
I lie and say I slept for eight hours
All seven nights of the week
She'll get to sleep
'Cause I worry about you, I worry about you
Don't worry about me, just worry about you
So, don't tell my mom, I'm fallin' apart
She hurts when I hurt, my scars are her scars
She'll talk to her friends, impress all of them
At least in her mind, her daughter is fine
Oh, please (please) don't (don't) let (let) her hear
I'm dyin' inside
'Cause she's dealt (dealt) with (with) this (this) for years
I got it this time
What you don't know won't hurt you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mama, I'll lie, just for you, no
What you don't know won't hurt you, oh (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mama, I'll lie, just for you
So, don't tell my mom, she's wearin' my heart
Her daughter might cry, but she'll be alright
