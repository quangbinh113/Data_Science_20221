Song Name: complex (demo)
I'm 21
The edge is razor-thin
Between being numb
And feeling everything
Good days only serve as relief again
Now I'm watching as I
Waste away my days and then
It's a cross dissolve
It's a scene I've played before
And the leading role that I thought I'd hold
Doesn't listen to me anymore
But I'm wearing his boxers
I'm being a good wife
We won't be together
But maybe the next life
I need him like water
He lives on a landslide
I cry in his bathroom
He turns off the big light
I'm being the cool girl
I'm keeping it so tight
I carry him home while
My friends have a good night
I need him like water
He thinks that I'm alright
I'm not feeling human
I think he's a good guy
But it's complex
It's a complex
It's a complex
I'm a complex
Triangular
I can see them now
Three points at which
I let myself down
I was just a girl
What's the excuse now?
Too regular, this pattern
I've been taking shelter in
Reaching new highs
When I was 19
I wanted to die
Now I just want to kill you
But I don't want to paint you the victim
And I talk a good game
I'd die for just the promise you'd listen
But I'm wearing his boxers
I'm being a good wife
We won't be together
But maybe the next life
I need him like water
He lives on a landslide
I cry in his bathroom
He turns off the big light
I'm being the cool girl
I'm keeping it so tight
I carry him home while
My friends have a good night
I need him like water
He thinks that I'm alright
I'm not feeling human
I think he's a good guy
But it's complex
It's a complex
It's a complex
I'm a complex
