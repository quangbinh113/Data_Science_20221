Song Name: Drunk Enough To
Getting dizzy as I look into your eyes
Spinning fast, Maserati
Swear I fell in love already like once or twice
Since we met at the party
I came solo
And I got nothing on tomorrow
You drink so slow
Time is turning, what are we waiting for?
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough to
Give me what I'm missing?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or looking good for me?
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough for
Bedroom education?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or is it time to leave? yeah-yeah
Picture you and me spinning like cubes of ice
In a glass of Bacardi
To the rhythm we both get intertwined
Feel the beat through your body
I came solo
And I got nothing on tomorrow
You drink so slow
Time is turning, what are we waiting for?
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough to
Give me what I'm missing?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or looking good for me?
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough for
Bedroom education?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or looking good for me?
Are you drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
When is it time to leave?
Are you drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
When is it time to leave? (Yeah-yeah)
I know I can't be the only one
Thinking 'bout you and me tonight
I know I can't be the only one
Thinking 'bout you and me tonight
I know I can't be the only one
Thinking 'bout you and me tonight
I know I can't be the only one
Thinking 'bout you and me tonight
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough to
Give me what I'm missing?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or looking good for me?
Are you drunk enough to
Give me your attention?
Drunk enough for
Bedroom education?
Are you looking good for no reason
Or looking good for me?
Are you drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
When is it time to leave?
Are you drunk enough to
Drunk enough to
When is it time to leave? Yeah-yeah
