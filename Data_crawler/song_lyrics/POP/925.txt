Song Name: Want Me Back
I know I was a fool to think that you would wait for me
Why did I let you go?
But I can't help but find your picture one more time to see
Your face light up my phone
I don't know what the future will be holding
All I know is I wanna be holding you
No, I didn't think I needed your love
But you're the only one that I've been thinking of
I'll do anything to get back your love
Say that you want me, say that you want me back
Just tell me what I gotta do to get you in my life
Just like we were before
Before I quit, I lost my grip, I let you slip
Out into the night
And watched you close the door
I don't know what the future will be holding
All I know is I wanna be holding you
No, I didn't think I needed your love
But you're the only one that I've been thinking of
I'll do anything to get back your love
Say that you want me, say that you want me back
No, I didn't think I needed your love
But now I don't think I could ever get enough
I'll do anything to get back your love
Say that you want me, say that you want me back
No, I didn't think I needed your love
But you're the only one that I've been thinking of
I'll do anything to get back your love
Say that you want me, say that you want me back
No, I didn't think I needed your love
But now I don't think I could ever get enough
I'll do anything to get back your love
Say that you want me, say that you want me back
