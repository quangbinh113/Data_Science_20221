Song Name: Potion (with Dua Lipa & Young Thug)
In the whip on a Tuesday night with the music high
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide, yeah
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkle with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment (ah), yeah (ah, ah, ah, yeah)
I've been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your love, that's what this track for
Fuckin' every bitch and never tell 'em, no
I'm pushin' P, they black and white, an Oreo
I've been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your love, that's what this track for
Buy niggas' bitches from the corner store
Thug, why you wanna do that? I don't even know
Ball like LeBron James in the finals
We 14Hunna, just like a minor
I'm yellin' "Free Big Meech" with designers
15 main hoes 'cause I'm undecided
I'm kickin' shit, karate, ooh
I'm servin' bricks somebody hood
Fuck the bitch, kept the challenge, ooh
Gucci flip flops and joggers, ooh
In the whip on a Tuesday night with the music high
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide, yeah
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah, yeah
Feelin' fly tonight, yeah, yeah
Goin' with the motherfuckin' vibe, yeah
It's goin' down tonight, oh, yeah
But don't you leave, don't you move
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom 'bout you, one, oh
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkle with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex, and it's a potion, yeah
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal, and it's a moment, yeah
