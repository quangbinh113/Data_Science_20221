Song Name: Summertime
When I close my eyes
You are always on my mind
When I turn off the light
I just want you by my side
Can you tell me a lie?
We are still together like old times
Can I call you tonight?
Can I, tonight?
When I close my eyes
The first time I saw your smile
Like sun in my summertime
I just want to go back
Under the Brooklyn bridge
The night we two first kissed
Why I still think about you?
It's been a long time
But everyday and every night
Can I call you tonight?
I think I'm still in love with you
Girl loving you, I'm loving you, still loving you, loving you...
