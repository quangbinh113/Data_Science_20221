Song Name: Roses
Yeah, I'll just leave 'em here on the table
I found an open letter asking if I feel better
I think my mama read it all last night
Now she feels worried 'bout me
'Cause I've stayed inside this whole week
Don't work that way, deep down I know she's right
I'm still too good at thinking 'bout you
Can't help myself
I can't forget that night
I went to say goodbye
Go get the last things I left at your house
I held you one last time
But then they caught my eye
Wrapped in a paper I'd not seen before
Who gave you all the roses?
Who gave you all the roses?
I wish I hadn't noticed
But who gave you all the roses?
I haven't left our bubble
I think I'm seeing double
I must be drunk, could swear these walls do talk
That night the rain was pouring
And all those lazy mornings
Am I the only one that wants them back?
I'm still too good at thinking 'bout you
Can't help myself
I can't forget that night
I went to say goodbye
Go get the last things I left at your house
I held you one last time
But then they caught my eye
Wrapped in a paper I'd not seen before
Who gave you all the roses?
Who gave you all the roses?
I wish I hadn't noticed
But who gave you all the roses?
I bought a set of lilies
Moved to another city
Looking for someone I could give 'em to
