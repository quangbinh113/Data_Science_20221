Song Name: Little Bother (feat. Foushe√©)
I guess
I'm screwed from my past life
And that's why I lost you
But if I think of the timeline
You were exhausting
But we couldn't have said goodbye (we couldn't have said goodbye)
Yeah, it wasn't an option
While you're watching the paint dry
Remember you lost me
And do you feel like you should?
Could have tried a little harder
It didn't make me feel good
I was just a little bother
(One, two, three)
Was I a crumb on your sleeve?
You were something like a god to me
I can't lie, it got to me
People suck, never us, you were my favorite person
It burns, I'm separating your words
You're not who you said you were
I put you up with the birds
This love shit is for the birds, I found peace
Remember, you lost me
And do you feel like you should?
Could have tried a little harder
It didn't make me feel good
I was just a little bother
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
You're a little bother
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
I guess I'll see you around (I guess I'll see you around)
You're a little bother
And do you feel like you should?
Could have tried (could have tried) a little harder
It didn't make me feel good
I was just a little bother
