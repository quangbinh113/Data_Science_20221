Song Name: Finally Came Around
I'm amaze whoo whoo
That I have all these feelings for you
You were there
All along in all these time
I'm nowhere I must that time
Can't try to find the one to be by my side
Cause my hopes, my dreams, my everything
And I found that all in you
Oh what can I say
I guess all that I found it something strange the way
So I wanna thank you
Thank you for waiting on me
I finally came around
Should've know, should've seen it all along
Oh I understand
There's ups and there's downs
But I'm grateful
So grateful we found each other
Cause I've been looking around
For the love that's true
Girl I found it all in you
And when I realize
I've been lose myself in your eyes
All this moments take me step towards baby
Only if you knew
Oh what can I say
I guess as I found it something strange the way
So I wanna thank you
Thank you for waiting on me
I finally came around
Should've know, should've seen it all along
Now I know (now I know)
Now you really meant to me
I finally came around
All this time pretending
But ain't it's funny how things all things turn out
We have enjoy the hypes and endure the lows
But together we have come this far and it's amazing
So yeah it's just beginning
And I cannot find the word to explain or express
How I feel this is true
This is love, this is real
But I want tell you and I really want to show you
How much you really mean to me
I wanna thank you
Thank you for waiting on me
I finally came around
Should've know, should've seen it all along
Now I know (now I know)
Now you are really meant to me
I'm finally came around
All this time pretending
But ain't it's funny how things turn out
