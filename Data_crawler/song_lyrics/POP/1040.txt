Song Name: Deja Vu
You'll never no what you're missing until you've had it
Now you're my living addiction and I'm an addict
I hit my limit, I'm giving into the habit
Breaking my heart, you're breaking my heart
I used to pray to the Devil, "Give me an angel"
I don't want nobody thinking that I'm ungrateful
But how could something so heavenly be so painful?
You're breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Like I'm caught in a wave, in a wave that's pulling me to you
Aww, it's like I'm stuck in a cycle of pain
But I don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose you
Ooh, it's déjà vu
It's killing me
No matter what I do
I keep falling back to you
Ooh, it's déjà vu
Playing on repeat
No matter what I do
I can't stop this déjà, déjà vu
You connect the new me to the old me
You're illuminati, you control me
You've been keeping secrets, never told me
Can't say goodbye
And I don't know why
You're my lifeline in the night-time
When I just need a taste
You're the red wine and the white lines
When I need my escape
You're my wartime in the peace time
I die every day
Yeah, you fuck me up
I can't get enough
Of you, it's déjà vu
It's killing me
No matter what I do
I keep falling back to you
Ooh, it's déjà vu
Playing on repeat
No matter what I do
I can't stop this déjà, déjà vu
Like I'm caught in a wave, in a wave that's pulling me to you
Aww, it's like I'm stuck in a cycle of pain
But I don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose you
Ooh, it's déjà vu
It's killing me
No matter what I do
I keep falling back to you
Ooh, it's déjà vu
Playing on repeat
No matter what I do
I can't stop this déjà, déjà vu
