Song Name: Dirty Shoes
Go baby go
It's wasting time to hold it
Or stay, baby stay
Stay here, I will throw it away
Keep my finger crossed this is just for you
Oh your land will be green and blue
Who needs a shelter, 'cause I'm with you
Heavy rain may clean your dirty shoes
So let's step out
And feel the ground sometimes
(Feel the ground sometimes)
Catch your clouds
And beat your bounds to the sky
(Your bounds to the sky)
Kissing, piles of dust this is just for you
Oh your land will be green and blue
Who needs a shelter, 'cause I'm with you
Heavy rain may clean your dirty shoes
So let's step out
And feel the ground sometimes
(Feel the ground sometimes)
Catch your clouds
And beat your bounds to the sky
(Your bounds to the sky)
So let's step out
And feel the ground sometimes
(Feel the ground sometimes)
Catch your clouds
And beat your bounds to the sky
(Your bounds to the sky)
