Song Name: High Hopes
High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, "Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy"
Manifest destiny back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, "Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams"
Museum victories everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, "Don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting"
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
Mama said, "It's uphill for oddities
Stranger crusaders ain't ever wannabes"
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Stay up on that rise, stay up on that rise
And never come down, oh-oh
Stay up on that rise, stay up on that rise
And never come down
Mama said, "Don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done, but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run, and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh"
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
