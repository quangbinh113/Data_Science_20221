Song Name: Conscious Club
Whew
Long flight (long flight)
It's my first night in Berlin, and I wanna dance
Where should I go?
Well, uh, there's Berghain
Or you can go to the Sisyphus
Actually, I read about this place
The Conscious Club?
Oh, the Conscious Club, with Joe Dart!
Vulfpeck is the house band
Yeah, yeah, Vulfpeck! That's it!
Do you know how to get there?
Actually, I do, but it's very, it's very, very complicated
Welcome to the Conscious Club (Conscious Club)
Conscious and we're filled with love
Welcome to the Conscious Club (welcome to the Conscious Club)
Conscious and we're filled with love
Breathe with me
Come everyone, let's have some good times
Gonna dance our past away
Welcome to the Conscious Club (welcome to the Conscious Club)
Conscious and we're filled with love
Welcome to the Conscious Club (welcome to the Conscious Club)
Conscious and we're filled with love
Breathe with me
Come everyone, let's have some good times
Gonna dance our past away
Close your eyes and earth-dive in this mud
Watch your thoughts, we're going to the Conscious Club
Every night at 9 p.m., there's a special cab
Get inside and say: "I feel," he'll ask you for your chant
Think of something interesting, this isn't relaxation
If he likes your improvisation, he'll take you to the train station
There, so close, you're so far from the start
Relax your face and say the password, "Ich bein Dart"
Breathe with me
Come everyone, let's have some fun
Gonna dance our past
Gonna dance our past away
The Conscious Club is under new management
