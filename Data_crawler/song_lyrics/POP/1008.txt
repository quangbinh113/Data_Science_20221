Song Name: Monica Lewinsky
I wanna make, wanna make history (like who?)
Like Britney, like Lindsay
Stunna like Monica Lewinsky (so cute)
No, really, that stone-cold, hot girl feelin'
Unapologetic with the fucked-up mind
Doin' all the crazy like it's ladylike
Like woo! History (I wanna make)
I wanna make, wanna make history
The year that I was born (yuh)
Girls were fucking presidents, in the residence
Then, when I was four
Shavin' all their heads and toyin' with the press
Yeah, I, I, I just gotta know
Where'd bad bitches go?
Who's gonna do it like they did back then?
One, two, three, check
Wanna make, wanna make history (like who?)
Like Britney, like Lindsay
Stunna like Monica Lewinsky (so cute)
No, really, that stone-cold, hot girl feelin'
Unapologetic with the fucked-up mind
Doin' all the crazy like it's ladylike
Like woo! History (I wanna make)
I wanna make, wanna make history
All of these songs goin' viral (goin' viral)
But when's the last time you saw a pop star spiral?
Too many tits with the blurred out face
I just dropped an album, so I think I'll drop a tape
Hannah raised me, Miley made me
Pulled some Psycho on the daily
I'll make you love me 'til you hate me ('til you hate me)
'Cause, baby, lately
I wanna make, wanna make history (like who?)
Like Britney (yuh), like Lindsay
Stunna like Monica Lewinsky (so cute)
No, really, that stone-cold, hot girl feelin' (yuh)
Unapologetic with the fucked-up mind
Doing all the crazy like it's ladylike
Like woo! History (I wanna make)
I wanna make, wanna make history
I-I did not have
Sexual relations with that woman
Miss Lewinsky
These allegations are false
Not like Monica Lewinsky (like Monica, like Monica, like Monica)
Monica, Monica Lewinsky (like Monica)
I just wanna make, I just wanna make
Wanna make history
