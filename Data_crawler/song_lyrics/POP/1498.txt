Song Name: Damn (Youâ€™ve Got Me Saying)
Let me explain it
When I did you wrong
I didn't know I'd feel this regret ('gret, 'gret, 'gret)
But it drives me crazy
To see you move on
While I lay alone in my bed (bed, bed, bed)
If I could rewind, take a step back in time
I would never do you like that
I made a mistake, so now it's too late
And there ain't no way I'm getting you back
You've got me saying, damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (ugh)
I should've treated you right
I should've been by your side
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (eye-eye-eye-eye)
And now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside
Like damn, I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life
I should've treated you right
I should've been by your side
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (eye-eye-eye-eye)
And now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside
Can't get no closure
But we said goodbye
I still feel the same as before (before)
Keep my composure
Believe me, I've tried to accept you're not mine anymore (no)
If I could rewind, take a step back in time
I would never do you like that, baby
I made a mistake, so now it's too late
And there ain't no way I'm getting you back
You've got me saying, damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (ugh)
I should've treated you right
I should've been by your side
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (eye-eye-eye-eye)
And now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside
Like damn, I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (walk right out my life)
I should've treated you right (ooh)
I should've been by your side (by your side)
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (eye-eye-eye-eye)
And now I can't even lie (lie), it's killin' me inside
Damn, I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, it's killin' me inside
Damn, I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, it's killin' me inside
Damn, I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, killin' me inside
Damn, I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me inside (Woah)
Damn, I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (my life)
I should've treated you right (you right)
I should've been by your side
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (oh-oh)
And now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside (inside)
Like damn, I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life
I should've treated you right
I should've been by your side
Like damn, I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye
And now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside
Damn
