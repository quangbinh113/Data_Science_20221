Song Name: Sugar
I'm hurtin', baby, I'm broken down
I need your lovin', lovin', I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm somethin' weak
You got me beggin', beggin', I'm on my knees, yeah (hey)
I don't wanna be needing your love (hey)
I just wanna be deep in your love (hey)
And it's killin' me when you're away, ooh, baby (hey)
'Cause I really don't care where you are (hey)
I just wanna be there where you are (hey)
And I gotta get one little taste
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Ayy, uh, uh)
My broken pieces, you pick 'em up
Don't leave me hangin', hangin', come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for (hey)
I don't wanna be needing your love (hey)
I just wanna be deep in your love (hey)
And it's killin' me when you're away, ooh, baby (hey)
'Cause I really don't care where you are (hey)
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar (your sugar), yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? Yeah
I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it, unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
I don't wanna play no games
You don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy sh-
No makeup on, that's my
Sugar, yes, please (please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
I'm right here (I'm right here) 'cause I need ('cause I need)
Little love and little sympathy
So baby (yeah), you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life (yeah, yeah, hey)
Your sugar (sugar), yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
Sugar, yes, please (woo)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
I'm right here (right here) 'cause I need (I need)
Little love and little sympathy (show, show, show)
Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar (sugar), yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me, down on me)
Ooh
