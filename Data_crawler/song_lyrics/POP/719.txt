Song Name: You Got Dreams
Why, why do I bother?
Even trying
I could say what's on my mind but
I'd be lying
Cuz I know
You want a better life
And that means leaving me behind
I can't keep you from going on
But I can't imagine moving on cuz
You got dreams
Somewhere without me
You got dreams
Somewhere without me
But that's okay
I'll find my way
To you
Why, why do I bother even trying
I could say what's on my mind but
I'd be lying
So for now I'm down and blue
It'll be a while till I see you
I hope we could still come through cuz
I don't know what I'd do if
You got dreams
Somewhere without me
You got dreams
Somewhere without me
But that's okay, I'll find my way
To you
And that's okay, I'll find my way
To you
You
You
