Song Name: Timber (feat. Ke$ha)
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
Ooh-ooh (Timber), ooh-ooh (Timber)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (It's goin' down)
Ooh-ooh (Timber), ooh-ooh (Timber)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (It's goin' down)
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's the way we like to what? (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down (Oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's going down (It's going down)
I'm yelling timber
You better move (You better move)
You better dance (You better dance)
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget (You won't forget)
Oh-oh (Timber), oh-oh (Timber)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's goin' down)
Oh-oh (Timber), oh-oh (Timber)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's goin' down)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like LeBron now, Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, why?
'Cause it's about to go down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down (Oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's going down (It's going down)
I'm yelling timber
You better move (You better move)
You better dance (You better dance)
Let's make a night (Let's make a night)
You won't remember
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
You won't forget (You won't forget)
Oh-oh (Timber), oh-oh (Hey)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's goin' down)
Oh-oh (Oh), oh-oh (Timber)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's goin' down)
Oh-oh (Timber), oh-oh (Come on)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's goin' down)
Oh-oh (Timber), oh-oh (You won't forget)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Timber)
