Song Name: Delilah (pull me out of this)
So, when I just got here
I was just a bit like
I don't want to be here anymore
Pull me out of this
(Hey Fred)
(Hahaha holy shit)
Pull me out of this
Pull me out of this
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
Pull me out of this
Pull me out of this
The music
The music
The music
The music's getting faster
(Oh my god)
Touch me
(Oh my god)
Talk to me
(I knew we were gonna dance, but)
(We danced so hard)
Touch me
(Hahaha holy shit)
Talk to me
Touch me
Talk to me
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down (play that shit Fred)
Pull me out of this
So they're all going harder
Big man ting, link up do fam, link up over do
My G Freddy
