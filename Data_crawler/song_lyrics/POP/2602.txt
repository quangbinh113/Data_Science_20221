Song Name: Victoria's Secret
God, I wish somebody would've told me when I was younger
That all bodies aren't the same
Photoshop, itty-bitty models on magazine covers
Told me I was overweight
I stopped eating, what a bummer
Can't have carbs and a hot girl summer
If I could go back and tell myself when I was younger
I'd say, "Psst"
I know Victoria's Secret
And girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me
Cashing in on body issues
Selling skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's Secret
She was made up by a dude (dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude (dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude
I wish somebody would've told me that thighs of thunder
Meant normal human thighs
The fucking pressure I was under
To lose my appetite
And fight the cellulite
With hunger games like every night
If I could go back and tell myself when I was younger
I'd say, "Hey, dummy"
I know Victoria's Secret
And girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me
Cashing in on body issues
Selling skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's Secret
She was made up by a dude (dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude (dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude
I know Victoria's Secret
And girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me
Cashing in on body issues
Selling skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's Secret
She was made up by a dude
I know Victoria's Secret
And girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me
Cashing in on body issues
Selling skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's Secret
She was never made for me and you
