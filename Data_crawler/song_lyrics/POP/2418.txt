Song Name: i'm sorry
I thought about what I would say
But I'm two years too late
I can't imagine how you're doing these days, hmm
Sure, it wasn't perfect back then
I'll be first to admit
But it was better than being strangers again, oh
I'm drunk too late talking to the moon
Writing songs I can't sing to you, 'cause
Ever since that day
The things I didn't say
They haunt me, oh
And I know that I'm to blame
So, go ahead and
Blame it on me, oh
I know that I'm too late
But I'll say it anyway
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Though it's far too late
And it was me, it wasn't you
It's clich√©, but it's true
I wasn't thinking how I usually do, oh
And is your momma doing well?
Or does she hate me still?
But it was hard to watch me put you through hell
I'm drunk, too late, talking to the moon, ooh
Writing songs I can't sing to you, 'cause
Ever since that day
The things I didn't say
They haunt me, oh
I know that I'm to blame
So, go ahead and
Blame it on me, oh
I know that I'm too late
But I'll say it anyway
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, hmm
I'm sorry
Though it's far too late
And if you ever hear this
I hope you know that
I'm not proud of who I've been, ooh
And if I see you again
I hope you know that
I wish you nothing but the best
And my biggest regret
Ever since that day
The things I didn't say
They haunt me
I know that I'm to blame
So go ahead and
Blame it on me, ooh
I know that I'm too late
But I'll say it anyway
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Hmm, I'm sorry
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry
