Song Name: Serotonin
My father told me
"Can't wake up happy everyday
Can't have the sun without the rain
Can't have the moments where you're truly on top of the world
Without the moments where you're down in the dirt"
It's something they don't really teach you in school
About anxiety, depression and the weight of the world
We're all looking for some gratification
A little love, a little validation
That's why
I'm glad I found someone like you
To see the sadness and the truth
I'm glad I found someone like you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like a pill takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
My father told me
"That's the thing about life
It only matters who you have by your side
Not the money or the cars that you're driving
That's some temporary high shit
Always chasing a climax"
That's why
I'm glad I found someone like you
Whose seen the sadness and the truth
I'm glad I found someone like you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like a pill takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like serotonin, serotonin
I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like a pill that takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I've found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like serotonin, serotonin
Like serotonin
