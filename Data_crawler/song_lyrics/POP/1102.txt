Song Name: Christmas Bells
Daylight is fading, turn on the lights
I'm drinking daily into the night
The radio's playing that old song by Slade
So I sit here blazing, memories we made
Mhm-mmm
When the Christmas bells ring out, they don't sound
Like they did every year you were here
When the mistletoe comes round, we don't kiss
Like we did all the years you were here
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Mhm
Everyone's praying this year it's white
Radio's playing the same old tune
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
When the Christmas bells ring out, they don't sound
Like they did every year you were here
When the mistletoe comes round, we don't kiss
Like we did all the years you were here
Snow fell down all around
On the day that you left town
Children sing in the streets
Songs you used to sing to me
Close my eyes until December ends
And all of the whiskey has been drank
All the wrapping paper has been torn
Just like my heart when you left home
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
When the Christmas bells ring out (the bells ring out)
They don't sound
Like they did every year you were here
When the mistletoe comes round (when it comes round)
We don't kiss
Like we did all the years you were here
When the Christmas bells ring out (the bells ring out)
They don't sound
Like they did every year you were here
When the mistletoe comes round (when it comes round)
We don't kiss
Like we did every year you were here
When the Christmas bells ring out (the bells ring out)
They don't sound
Like they did all the years that you were here
When the mistletoe comes round (when it comes round)
We don't kiss
Like we did all the years you were here
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
