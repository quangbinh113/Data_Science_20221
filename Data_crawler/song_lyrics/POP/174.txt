Song Name: You Don't Know Me
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak,
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell,
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
Mmmmm
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
Who longs to kiss your lips,
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend,
That's all I've ever been
Cause you don't know me
I never knew the art of makin' love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by,
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky girl
Oh you will never know,
The one who loves you so,
Well, you don't know me
You give your hand to me,
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky girl
Oh you will never know,
The one who loves you so,
Cause you don't know me
Ohhhhh, no you don't know me
Oooooh, you don't know me.
