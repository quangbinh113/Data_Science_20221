Song Name: Half of the Way
Used to think I was fine on my own, yeah
Had a house but you made it a home
I'll be your light on your darkest day
Just don't love me, love me, half of the way
Used to carry the weight of it all, yeah
Before I had you there to break my fall
Pay no mind to what your friends may say
Just don't love me, love me, half of the way
We're half of the way
To being broken hearted
We're half of the way
Unless you let me in
We're half of the way
From being back to the start
So don't love me, love me, half of the way, hoo
I could see you were lonesome as me, yeah
You said you could have used some company
I chip away but your walls don't break
You still love me, love me, half of the way
We're half of the way
From being broken hearted
We're half of the way
Unless you let me in, darling
We're half of the way
From being back to the start
So don't love me, love me, half of the way
You can say that it's only a game
I don't mind playing the fool
But nobody wants to hold half of a hand
And nobody breaks half the rules
No, no, hoo
Yeah
Oh baby
I'll be your light on your darkest day
Just don't love me, love me, half of the way
We're half of the way
To being broken hearted
We're half of the way
Unless you let me in, darling
We're half of the way
From being back to the start
So don't love me, love me, half the way
We're half of the way
Yeah, yeah, baby, oh yeah
We're half of the way
Yeah
We're half of the way
From being back to the start
So don't love me, love me, half of the way
Just don't love me, love me, half of the way
Just don't love me, love me, half of the way
Oh, oh, no, no
Play, yeah, yeah, on
