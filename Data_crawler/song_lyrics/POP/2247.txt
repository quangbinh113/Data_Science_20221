Song Name: WDIA (Would Do It Again)
Time didn't change me
But what about you?
I think of you lately
And I wonder if you do
If you try to erase me
Do I kill you in ways
That kill me too?
'Cause I'll take all the pain, all the bruises and blame
And repeat it 'til I go insane
If I could go back
Chasing what we had
Straight through the pitch black
I would do it again
You pulled me inside
Into your riptide
Under a landslide
But I would do it again
I was a child
Imitating a woman
Caught in the wild
And you trained me what to do
And I was chained to the feeling
The sickness, the habit, the highs, and the tragic
The depths that you fall to for love
And I'll take all the pain, shoot it inside my veins
And repeat it 'til I go insane
If I could go back (go, go back)
Chasing what we had (we, we had)
Straight through the pitch black (pitch black)
I would do it again (again, again, again)
You pulled me inside (in-inside)
Into your riptide (rip-riptide)
Under a landslide (landslide)
I would do it again, I would do it again, yeah
I would
Lie to myself just to make you the truth
I would
Run through the flames to get closer to you
I would
And if I could go back (go, go back)
Chasing what we had (we, we had)
Straight through the pitch black (pitch black)
I would do it again (again, again, again)
You pulled me inside (in-inside)
Into your riptide (rip-riptide)
Under a landslide (landslide)
I would do it again
I would do it again, yeah, I would
