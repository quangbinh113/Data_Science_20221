Song Name: World We Used To Know
Wild, wild, wild horses, tell me
Where did they all go?
They used to roam, used to run, used to run right here
And all I see is an empty road
Wild, wild, wild roses, tell me
Where did they all go?
When I was young, I was young, they would spread like fire
And now the roots don't know where to grow
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this
Is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know
White, white, white oceans, tell me
Where do you lead?
When the sun and the sky come to meet at night
I wonder, would you carry me?
Why won't you tell me if I'm on my own
You used to be, used to be, used to be right here
And now I don't know where to go
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this
Is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know
I could show you the places that we had
In the world we used to know
Take me home and show me love can last
There's a world we used to know
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this
Is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know
