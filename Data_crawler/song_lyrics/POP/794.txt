Song Name: Feelin' Lucky Lately - Remastered
Feeling lucky lately
I can feel this is my time
And I think that I can make it
Feeling lucky lately gonna experence and no crime
And i'm feeling is my turn
And it's coming around
You used to be the most of a person you didn't have no more confidence
You know it diddn't make no sense
Had so many nights with expetations
You didn't have your self-steem
I can you ever fill your dreams
Until now ooooh eh Ah
But i didn't stay the night (stay the night)
Believing in myself (in myself)
Feeling lucky lately i can feel this is my time
And I think that I can make it (think that i can make it)
Feeling lucky lately gonna experence enough you
Crime got i feel enough your journeys coming around
(Feeling) feeling lucky lately i can feel this is my time
And I think that I can make it (I think that i can make it)
You used to feel the luck was not a potion and you will try to
Reached out your hand somebody's elses turning
Instead When life gets hard you think you'll never make it
When you have a steady love
Got to think you're reaching your goal Until now ooooh eh Ah got a
Strong state of mind(state of mind) Believing in myself Feeling lucky
Lately i can feel this is my time and I think that I can make it
Feeling lucky lately gonna experence and no crime Got to get that
Feeling yeah If your world won't change around and it's going make no
Sense goes around your confidence If you'd better wait for that
Moment Will be a turning to shine So believe
In yourself You can change your (state of mind)
