Song Name: Fantasy
Loving you is easy
It's a tragedy
It's a fantasy
Wasting night and day
It's a tragedy
It's a fantasy
I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
No, I won't, no, I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
Rushing through your thoughts
It's a tragedy
It's a fantasy
Having you inside me
It's a tragedy
It's a fantasy
I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
No, I won't, no, I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
No, I won't, no, I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
No, I won't, no, I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
Don't wanna leave you today
No, no, no, I wanna stay
I won't leave
All that I need is to stay
All that I need is to st-
