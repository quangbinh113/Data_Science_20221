Song Name: Woman
Hey, woman
Hey, woman
Woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Know what you need
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed
She can grow it from the womb, a family
Provide loving, overlooked and unappreciated, you see? (Yeah)
You can't reciprocate, I got delicious taste
You need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say
"(Boy), let me be your woman"
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your lady, I'm a woman
I'm a motherfucker, but they got a problem
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in the picture, like a diorama
Gotta face it, lot of people love the opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got that common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you will never know a god without the goddesses, honest
It's fucking honest, kid, and I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til it's pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just like a Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ahead of these niggas' dream, girl
They wanna pit us against each other when we succeed
And for no reasons, they wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (wow)
Woman (daddy)
Let me be your woman (be your-)
Woman, woman, woman (I need to be your-)
I can be your woman (daddy)
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)
Let me be your woman (I need)
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)
I can be your woman (I want)
Woman, woman, woman
Be (hey woman, woman)
Be, mmm-hmm (woman, hey woman)
Mmm-hmm (woman)

Hey, woman
