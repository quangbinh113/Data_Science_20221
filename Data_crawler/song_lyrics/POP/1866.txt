Song Name: 10:35
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
Everyday, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now
They look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end
I don't know where this night is goin' (goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin' (somethin')
So many things that I'm afraid of (afraid of)
But right now I ain't scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know is)
(All I know is, all I, all I)
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry
About tomorrow
Don't you worry
Just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
Every night, I go places in my dreams
So many never-ending alleyways
I don't know what it means
But this is it
I know the sun will wake me up
Tell me I'd be dumb to not get what I want
I don't know where this night is goin' (goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin'
So many things that I'm afraid of
But right now I ain't scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know is)
(All I know is, all I-, all I-)
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry
About tomorrow
Don't you worry
Just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me (uh-oh, oh)
It's 10:35 (ooh-oh)
10:35 (uh-oh, oh)
Know it's 10:35 (uh-oh, oh)
Know it's 10:35 (uh-oh, oh)
