Song Name: better off without me
Hard to say
If its haunted in these hallways
But the ghost of us is always hanging round
I'll take the blame
But I can't change the hurt you're feeling
Falling too hard left us needing solid ground
When we started this with
Reckless promises
I never wanted it to end
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day i'll just be a memory and you'll be better
Better off without me
I like to think
I was not the destination
Just a long night at some station on the way
Temporary stop along your way
Won't be long now
Someday when you're someone else's
Yeah You'll say it's for the best we walked away
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day i'll just be a memory and you'll be better
Better off without me
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day i'll just be a memory and you'll be better
Better off without me
