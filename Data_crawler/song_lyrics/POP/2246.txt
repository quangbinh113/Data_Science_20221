Song Name: Heaven (feat. Hoàng Duyên)
I used to count the stars in the sky
Now I count the ones in your eyes
I used to think that my paradise
Was somewhere waiting on the other side
But you, ooh-ooh
Take me higher than I've been
Laying hands on my skin
It's true, ooh-ooh
Nothing compares to you
So tell me why, what good is life
If we're all just waiting to dance in the sky?
I'm already there, here in your eyes
We climb the gates every time that you lie down next to me
I rest in peace
They say it's better, but how could that be?
If everyone had a love like us
They wouldn't call that place above
Heaven
Waking up to you feels like a pinch-myself moment
If we're only here for a while
I wanna spend all of it holding you, ooh-ooh
Take me higher than I've been
Got me questioning everything I knew, ooh-ooh
'Cause nothing compares to you
Bài ca đang mở, váy hoa nên thơ
Đèn đường phát sáng góc phố sớm khuya hẹn chờ
Trời cao trong thanh, chúng ta hiền lành
Tìm bình an quý cất một đời này yêu mãi nhất
Nỗi nhớ ngày hè thành ấm áp ngày thu
Cười trong veo tan giòn kìa bé lon ton chạy
Thời trẻ qua đi rồi, già nua sẽ tới
Có sao tâm tình bình đạm sẻ chia thôi
Heaven
Nothing comes, nothing comes close to this
Looking up, looking up even if it exists
My heaven is on your lips
So tell me why, what good is life
If we're all just waiting to dance in the sky?
I'm already there, here in your eyes
We climb the gates every time that you lie down next to me
I rest in peace
They say it's better, but how could that be?
If everyone had a love like us
They wouldn't call that place above
Heaven
