Song Name: Secrets - Radio Edit
Oh won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for a while?
Show me goggles baby
Show me deep inside
Oh won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for a while?
Show me goggles baby
Show me deep inside
Oh won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Stay a while
Stay a while and I will make it worth your while
Worth your while
Stay a while
Stay a while and I'ma go the extra mile
Extra mile
Boy if you wait until the lights goes down
I got some drinks that'll help scream right now
So stay a while
Stay a while and I'll make it worth your while
Worth your while
Oh won't you stay for a while?
Oh won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh
