Song Name: Hardcore
Seven inch, ride like that
We could get high like that
Look at this body, looking all godly
I could be all you need
All your wild fantasies
Look at this body, sweeter than honey
One million diamonds don't shine as bright, yeah
You got me losing my mind, and
I won't ever let you go
Baby, it's all hardcore
Go, make my heart explode
I want you hardcore
Baby, it's only one life right now
I could just die right now
Baby, so classic
I'm all up in your magic
I could be yours to keep
Pretty please, on your knees
Come a little closer
Deeper than an ocean
One million diamonds don't shine as bright, yeah
You got me losing my mind, and
I won't ever let you go
Baby, it's all hardcore
Go, make my heart explode
I want you hardcore
Baby, it's yeah-yeah, hardcore
Yeah-yeah, hardcore (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Baby, it's yeah-yeah, hardcore (yeah)
Yeah-yeah, hardcore
Baby, it's-
