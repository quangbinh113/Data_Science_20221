Song Name: i tried
Why is loving you so hard?
Why is letting go the hardest part?
Did we love too fast?
Can we not go back now
And leave the weapons lying on the ground?
When did all these scars take the place of us?
I need some reminding of who I was
I tried to hold on so tight
But you left when I needed you most
I guess hearts like mine were meant to be broke
I know I thought we had more time
When you left, didn't know what I'd lost
You only know it's love when it's gone
And now it's too late
I can still see that look on your face
Was every tear you cried meant for me?
Did we start in the darkness?
Did it just find us?
Or are some things just not meant to be?
I tried to hold on so tight
But you left when I needed you most
I guess hearts like mine were meant to be broke (meant to be broke)
I know I thought we had more time
When you left, didn't know what I'd lost
You only know it's love when it's gone
And now it's too late
And now it's too late
You only know it's love when it's gone
And now it's too late
