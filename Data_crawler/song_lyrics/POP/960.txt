Song Name: Hypotheticals
Obviously, we're at the beginning of something
I don't expect you to know how it's gonna go
But I believe we might be onto something
And I just thought maybe you should know
I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the posibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should be livin' next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see
Immediate action is unnecessary
It's a fatal attraction, it's a little scary
But I got a plan of attack
And I'll get us there someday soon, I know it
I got a Plan A, and I got a Plan B
And if it's absolutely necessary, we'll go to Plan C
Whatever I gotta do to be with you
I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the posibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should be livin' next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see
Nobody can see into the future
Even the weatherman gets caught in the rain sometimes
But I see something in you that I've never seen before
And I can't be sure, no, maybe not
But I think it's worth a shot
Hypothtically, yes
Theoretically, forever
We'll see what happens
But I hope we will never be apart
Hypothetically, yes
Theoretically, forever
We'll see what happens
But I hope we will never be apart
Oh, hypothetically, yes
Theoretically, forever
We'll see what happens
But I hope we will never be apart
Oh, hypothetically, yes
Theoretically, forever
We'll see what happens
But I hope we will never be apart
I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
(Playing out a lot of hypotheticals)
I've been writing your name down next to mine
(I've been writing your name down next to mine)
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams (all the possibilities)
You're alone when you should be livin' next to me (oh, yeah)
Baby, let's not wait and see
