Song Name: Kingston
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
