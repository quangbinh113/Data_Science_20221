Song Name: Wellerman - Sea Shanty / 220 KID x Billen Ted Remix
There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
O blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey)
One day when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below (huh)
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey)
One day when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey)
One day when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
