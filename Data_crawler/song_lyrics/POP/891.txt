Song Name: Anna
I long to tell you
How much I need you
If I can find the words to say
I'd never have to feel this way
Not knowing just what to do when I'm with you
My friends, they tell me
That I shouldn't hurry
Yet, this feeling keeps going strong
Because you keep it going on
Though, I have to say how much I love you
Anna, can't you tell and see
What you're doing to me?
Oh, Anna, this feeling I just can't hide
Keeps driving me wild
Oh, Anna, I need you here with me
I wish it could be
Oh, Anna, won't you stay with me?
Your eyes, they look through me
Your smile, babe, it fools me
I never thought I'd love again
But this time, I hope it never ends
I have to let you know I love you
Anna, can't you tell and see
What you're doing to me?
Oh, Anna, this feeling I just can't hide
Keeps driving me wild
Oh, Anna, I need you here with me
I wish it could be
Oh, Anna, won't you stay with me?
Oh, Anna, can't you tell and see
What you're doing to me?
Oh, Anna, this feeling I just can't hide
Keeps driving me wild
Oh, Anna, I need you here with me
I wish it could be
Oh, Anna, won't you stay with me?
Oh, Anna
Oh, Anna, can't you tell and see
What you're doing to me?
Oh, Anna, this feeling I just can't hide
Keeps driving me wild
Oh, Anna, I need you here with me
I wish it could be
