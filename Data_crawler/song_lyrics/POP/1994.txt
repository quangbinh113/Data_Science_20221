Song Name: i'm yours sped up
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
I know that you love me
Darling, you don't have to say it
You know you can trust me
It's okay, it's complicated
Nervous, trip over my words
You're so pretty, it hurts
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more, I'll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
Is it too late to see you?
I love the view of your headlights
Wanna get to know you (know you)
Brought you to my house for the night
Nervous, trip over my words
You're so pretty, it hurts
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more, I'll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
We're gettin' closer, inches away
Lose composure, favorite mistake
Friendship's over, won't be the same (won't be the same)
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(I need something more, more, more)
(But baby, I'm yours)
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more, I'll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
