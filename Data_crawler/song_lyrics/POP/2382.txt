Song Name: when was it over? (feat. Sam Hunt)
Was it that night you didn't ask where I had been?
Was it that fight we didn't have when I came in?
Was it the first time that you saw me drunk?
Second time that I said, "I'm sorry"?
Third time that I didn't call?
Stayed out and missed your party?
That time I met your friends, I was indifferent
The way you act has got me questionin'
When was it over for you?
When was it over?
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
It's still not over for me
I didn't ask if you were okay
After a fight with your mom
The last timе I stayed over at your place
And you wokе up alone
Was it the first time you pulled away?
Second time that we drove to Texas?
Third time we ran into one of my random exes?
So was it ever real?
Or was it all pretend?
The way you act has got me wonderin'
When was it over for you?
When was it over? (When was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
It's still not over for me
I'm still holdin' on to you
But I know you're already gone
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long
When was it over for you?
When was it over? (When was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
Tell me, when was it over for you?
When was it over?
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
I'm still holdin' on to you
But I know you're already gone
It's still not over for me
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long
(When was it over)
