Song Name: New Love (feat. Ellie Goulding)
Think I forgot to breathe
Did you forget my name?
I wrote your symphonies
They all just sound the same
Don't know what I believe in
'Cause I just kept moving on
Said, I should take a seat
I know where I came from
I got new love, love in me
I got new love, love in me
I got new love, love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
Didn't always like myself
Didn't always get it right
Thought I was someone else
And that's the girl you liked
Don't know what I believe in
'Cause I just kept moving on
Said, I should take a seat
I know where I came from
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love
If you could see me now
I got a feeling you'd be dancing next to me
I'm on my own, but I could never be lonely
I got new love in me now
Got electricity in every bone like woah
Now I'm overthinking that I'm not who I should be
I got new love in me
I got new love, love in me
I got new love, love in me
I got new love, love in me
I got new love
If you could see me now
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love, I got new love in me now
I got electricity in every bone like, woah
Now I'm overthinking that I'm not who I should be
I got new love in me (I got new love)
If you could see me now
I got new love, I got new love in me
I got new love
