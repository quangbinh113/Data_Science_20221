Song Name: Goosebumps - Remix
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
713 through the 281, yeah, I'm ridin'
Why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh, no, I can't fuck with y'all, yeah
When I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong, yeah
Saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed, yeah
They gon' pull up on you (brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate, yeah
'Cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
Feels way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
