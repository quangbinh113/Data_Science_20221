Song Name: Prada (feat. Lil Tecca)
(Perfect)
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
Designer (yeah), shorty said she really like designer (designer)
Bought that bitch a body, I designed her (yeah, yeah)
Riding Kawasaki, better slide up (skrrt, skrrt)
Bro' just got his re-up, better cop up (oh-oh)
If I'm in the city, you should know (you should know)
I'm in that four-door, me and three hoes (three hoes)
Ayy, if I'm with your bitch, then you should know (you should know)
She fuck with us, now she ain't comin' home (coming home)
My new bitch see me everyday (my new bitch see me everyday)
Tinted windows on the whip, you can't see me anyway (oh-oh)
Make a lot of wishes, need a genie any day
And she ain't really want you, all she really want is
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
Flashy clothes, you know a nigga getting hoes
And plenty dough, won't let the game change me
Go and go, and then I had to go some more
These niggas hoes, but they don't really faze me
'Cause I was 18, broke as a fiend, did what I had to do (ooh)
19, stuck in a dream, acting irrational (ooh)
20 thousand on me, we caught a casual (ooh)
All these .48s at 21 though
And still ain't chasing hoes
'Cause they ain't give a fuck way back 'fore I was up (oh-no)
And I ain't savin' hoes
'Cause they be tryna front, but I know what you want
She want some
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
Prada, that's on my shoes, that's on my shirt, that's on my collar
I hit it once, ain't hit her back 'cause I'm a baller
I told that bitch to do a trick and she said, "Ta-da"
I get a lot of guala, spent it all on
