Song Name: Heartbreak in a Box
It's the morning and I still can't feel a thing
How 'bout you?
When they told me it was comin' to an end
Your lips got better too
I wish I had a chance to throw away the key
Or hide this little wooden box from you and me
But we both know by now
It's the only thing that's here to stay
Lips on my neck
I won't forget
You no, no
I'm feelin' like it's
Too good for us honey
But I know sometimes the good ain't good enough
And it's so hard to
Leave it all like it's nothin'
Now we're waitin' on the day
When tomorrow runs away
And I'm holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
To this heartbreak in a box
And I'm holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
If only time would take a break from all its movin'
These impressions seem to paint me as a fool
But when the evening donned her favorite kind of blue
I found my heart did too
Lips on my neck
I won't forget
You no, no
I'm feelin' like it's
Too good for us honey
But I know sometimes the good ain't good enough
And it's so hard to
Leave it all like it's nothin'
Now we're waitin' on the day
When tomorrow runs away
And I'm holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
To this heartbreak in a box
And I'm holdin' on, holdin on, holdin' on
And as the seasons changed
They said our love would fade
Just like the leaves in September
And in this endless rain
Our story stays the same
Won't you remember?
And as the seasons changed
They said our love would fade
Just like the leaves in September
But in this endless rain
Our story stays the same
Won't you remember?
I'm feelin' like it's
Too good for us honey
But I know sometimes the good ain't good enough
And it's so hard to
Leave it all like it's nothin'
Now we're waitin' on the day
When tomorrow runs away
And I'm holdin' on holdin' on holdin' on
To this heartbreak in a box
And I'm holdin' on holdin on holdin' on
To this heartbreak in a box
And I'm holdin' on holdin' on holdin' on
To this heartbreak in a box
And I'm holdin' on holdin' on holdin' on
