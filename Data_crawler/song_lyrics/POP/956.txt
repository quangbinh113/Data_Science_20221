Song Name: Fly Girl
Never thought you were the problem
Always thinkin I could solve em
But then I realized that you and I were toxic from the start
Your heart is broken
You should learn to love yourself before you love that someone else
I hope you do
You just put me down
When you are around
I just wish that you could see me too
But look inside your heart
Now tell me who you are
You are
And I say fly girl
You cant make your mind up
Always in my lineup
And ditch me when you want girl
All these games your playin
Maybe you should stay in
Cause your always sayin
Baby I dont know
You care too much if people like you
You think theyre always trying to spite you
You change your hair too much
Its all because you just want to be seen
My mama thinks you crazy
And I finally agree
That your the most and they all know
But I just hope yourself?
Though you put me down
When you are around
I just wish that you could see me too
But look inside your heart
Now tell me who you are
You are
And I say fly girl
You cant make your mind up
Always in my lineup
And ditch me when you want girl
All these games your playin
Maybe you should stay in
Cause your always sayin
Baby I dont know
And Im sorry you
Havent had the time to get to know yourself
Yeah
And Im fallin too
Well be so much better
So much better
I say fly girl
You cant make your mind up
Always in my lineup
And ditch me when you want girl
All these games your playin
Maybe you should stay in
Cause your always sayin
Baby I dont
I dont I dont
I wanna hear yall sing it
