Song Name: Kindness
I'm in love with your kindness
In love with the mystery
You and I, we were meant to be
It's algorithm, baby
And if I'm lost in the darkness
I'm sure that you will come search for me
I'm in love with your kindness
It's algorithm, algorithm, algorithm, baby
I hear the whole world talk
But I'm stuck on my keyboard
Yeah, I forgot how to walk away (boo-yeah)
Now my boyfriend's gone
So is my luck and my ties
I know I gotta stay strong, gotta stay strong
But when I see you I come back to life
Lying in your hands, baby, victory smile
When you grab me hands to the sky
Carrying me through the room
I'm in love with your kindness
In love with the mystery
You and I, we were meant to be
It's algorithm, baby (algorithm, baby)
And if I'm lost in the darkness
I'm sure that you will come search for me
I'm in love with your kindness
It's algorithm, algorithm, algorithm, baby
Man, I've been so gloomy
Thinking about what used to be
Now in my dreams I see reality (boo-yeah)
I hear the whole world talking at once, talk as one
Let me in, shake me out of my shell
I wanna feel like myself again (woo!)
But when I see you I come back to life
Lying in your hands, baby, victory smile
When you grab me hands to the sky
Carrying me through the room
I'm in love with your kindness
In love with the mystery
You and I, we were meant to be
It's algorithm, baby (algorithm, baby)
And if I'm lost in the darkness
I'm sure that you will come search for me
I'm in love with your kindness
It's algorithm, algorithm, algorithm, baby
We're in love with the star power
In love with the pure serenity
The whole world might be burning up
But we're holding up, give us star power
We're in love with the star power
In love with the pure serenity
The whole world might be burning up
But we're holding up, give us star power
Boo-yeah
