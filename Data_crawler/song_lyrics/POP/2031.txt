Song Name: Spinnin
(One hunnid)
(Hey, Maui)
Yeah, look
They said that I couldn't do it, so I went and (woo)
(Yeah) did it (ah)
Ws only, you know I've been
(Winnin') winnin' (ooh)
Top of the world, the globe is
(Spinnin') spinnin' (yeah)
If you know, you know, I've been on a
What? (Mission) mission (go), okay, let's get it
Got a little time on my hands like a wristwatch
I don't got time for the breaks and the pit stop
Race through the gridlock, take it like Chris Rock
Right to the chin, still win, heavy metals like Slipknot
Got the drive and I got tunnel vision
I just hit my stride the way I run the business
I've been makin' paper like I'm Dunder Mifflin
See the endgame, I got WandaVision, look
I don't еver bother wit' a critic
Hit 'em wit' a Chroniclе of Riddick, boom
Bottle full of Ritalin, I hit 'em with a little bit of riddle-me-this
Riddle me that, my bad, fell asleep at the gas
No time to wait, though
Elon Musk, I'm tryna bankroll
New Tesla just 'cause I say so
Electric whip like Ivan Vanko
I just (I just) did it (did it)
Ws only, you know I've been (you know I've been)
Winnin' (winnin')
Top of the world, the globe is (ayy)
Spinnin' (spinnin')
If you know, you know, I've been on a (yeah, yeah)
Mission, okay, let's get it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've been on a mission like Totally Spies!
On my bed and she bad, but she totally nice (nice)
Nails are blue and her toes, they look white (what?)
They completely match out at the shoe for my leg (yeah, yeah)
He knew it for sure, but he left wit' a "Why?" (Why)
Yeah, we live, but we destined to die (uh)
And you'd say that I'm mad, but I'm endin' a lie (uh)
I'm a lion, ik voel me net Memphis Depay (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
En ik jaag op de cool thing to see (see)
Moest eigenlijk rennen we lopen misschien
En ik wil niet eens kijken mijn ogen die zien
En ze weet niet genoeg dat ik hoop op een tien
Who finna be? (Uh) Y acosta (really?)
I got five in my name, he got new stuff (okay)
Come to me just to see how my shoes are (yeah)
They said that I couldn't do it, so I went and (woo)
(Yeah) did it (ah)
Ws only, you know I've been
(Winnin') winnin' (ooh)
Top of the world, the globe is
(Spinnin') spinnin' (yeah)
If you know, you know, I've been on a
What? (Mission) mission (go), okay, let's get it
