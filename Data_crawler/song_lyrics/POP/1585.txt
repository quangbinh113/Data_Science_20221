Song Name: All That She Wants
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
When she woke up late
In the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up
Her eyes and thought
Oh, what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach
And having fun
She's going to get ya
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)
So if you are in sight
And the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice
That talks to you
Won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get ya
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)
