Song Name: I Love U
(いけいけ 団長!)
(頑張れ 頑張れ 団長!)
In the Range outside and I'm thinking about loose ends
Even though we cut ties I don't wanna be just friends
From the day I got your number like Paris in the summer it ends
Every day that goes by I wish I was in your bed
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, God
Oh-oh-oh
Tryin' to find a reason why we can't work this out
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, my God
Oh-oh-oh
It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh (love ya)
I love you, oh, my God
You were on the west side, I was driving down the I-10
And the song came on, got me thinking who you chose instead
Oh, I never thought twice, but I wonder what you see in them
Another day goes by that I can't get you out of my head
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, God
Oh-oh-oh
Tryin' to find a reason why we can't work this out
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, my God
Oh-oh-oh
It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh (love ya)
(I love you)
When it hits, I'm convinced that you know it's not over
All my loves counterfeit unless you're comin' over
Do you think of my voice when your city gets colder?

(頑張れ 頑張れ 団長!)
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, God
Oh-oh-oh
Tryin' to find a reason why we can't work this out
Oh-oh-oh
I love you, oh, my God
Oh-oh-oh (oh, my God)
I love you
Ooh-oh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh (it's hard, it's hard)
(It's hard to find) it's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
