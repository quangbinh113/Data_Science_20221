Song Name: Miss Summer
I can feel the rhythm of my heartbeat
When I smell your scent the summer breeze
I still remember the heat of your body
Its hard to control myself when you're next to me
Cause you like me crazy sunshine
Can't get you out of my mind
Don't set my heart on fire
Girl you're too hot for the summertime
You like me crazy sunshine
Can't get you out of my mind
Don't set my heart on fire
Girl you're too hot for the summertime
Please don't come to close
I can't take it anymore baby
Please don't come to close
I can't take it anymore (can't take it anymore)
Please don't come to close
I can't take it anymore baby
Please don't come to close
I can't take it anymore (can't take it anymore)
Cause you like me crazy sunshine
Can't get you out of my mind
Don't set my heart on fire
Girl you're too hot for the summertime
You like me crazy sunshine
Can't get you out of my mind
Don't set my heart on fire
Girl you're too hot for the summertime
