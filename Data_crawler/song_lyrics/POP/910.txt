Song Name: Gun
Do you remember
When you're feeling all alone
We're talkin' over for a while
Slow down your heartbeat
So many things, to say
Let me tell you everything
Crazy about your love
Thinking about you every night, everytime
Oh baby baby baby
Crazy about your, love
You and I feel so lucky tonight
For your love
Just pray for peace in this world
Smile and kiss me, one more time
For your love
Baby I wish on a shooting star
It is over
Put down your blazing down
They're peace and magic, in this world
A sleepless city
I'm dreaming of the street
A miracle had happened, tonight
Crazy about your love
Thinking about you every night, everytime
Oh baby baby baby
Crazy about your love
You and I feel so lucky tonight
For your love
Just pray for peace in this world
Smile and kiss me, one more time
For your love
Baby I wish on, a shooting star
For your love
Just pray for peace in this world
Smile and kiss me, one more time
For your love
Baby I wish on, a shooting star
