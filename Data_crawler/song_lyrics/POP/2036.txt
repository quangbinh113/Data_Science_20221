Song Name: Bleed
You were cold blooded
Cold, cold blooded for me
Cold blooded
Cold, cold blooded for me
I'd been running circles
Tryna figure out things I didn't know (ooh-woah)
All the things you told me
Were they meaningless? I needed to know (ooh-woah)
So I take another lap
While your knife pushed through my back
I told you I'm not mad
So let's stop before we crash (crash)
'Cause I don't wanna run anymore
Yeah, I'd let you bleed
Waste time that I need
But lately it feels like I'm dying to leave
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging for peace
But maybe it's you that nobody believes
So take what you want
And take what you need
You eat me alive just like a disease
Yeah, I'd let you bleed
Waste time that I need
'Cause you know that I wear my heart on my sleeve
('Cause you know that I wear my heart on my sleeve)
You'd be praying on my downfall
Each and every phone call
Just to see if I'd stay away
You and I could never break this
Never ending focus
Seeing who could keep playing games
So tell your lies
We pretend it's everlasting when everything is rotten
So you and I
Let's take a ride
You lie through your teeth
Feels so incomplete
Wait for your story to take you too deep
And I call out your name
Yeah, I'd let you bleed
Waste time that I need
But lately it feels like I'm dying to leave
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging for peace
But maybe it's you that nobody believes
So take what you want
And take what you need
You eat me alive just like a disease
Yeah, I'd let you bleed
Waste time that I need
'Cause you know that I wear my heart on my sleeve
You were cold blooded
Cold, cold blooded for me
Cold blooded
Cold, cold blooded for me
Cold blooded
Cold, cold blooded for me
