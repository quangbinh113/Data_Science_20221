Song Name: It's Corn
For me
I really like corn
What do you like about corn?
It's corn!
A big lump with knobs
It has the juice (it has the juice)
I can't imagine a more beautiful thing (Woo)
It's corn!
I can tell you all about it
I mean look at this thing
When I tried it with butter, everything changed!
Well, the best thing about corn is the grease
The corn break can restore your energy
You really appreciate the hard work when you love something
If you or anyone loves corn
If you come to me, I can tell you all about it
If I was surrounded by corn
I would eat all of it, grow big and strong
Look at this, take a lump with the knob
Spread butter on
Boil it and toast it with the grease
Butter spreads out the good taste
I just saw corn as disgusting
But everything changed
It's corn!
A big lump with knobs
It has the juice (it has the juice)
I can't imagine a more beautiful thing (Woo)
It's corn!
I can tell you all about it
I mean look at this thing
When I tried it with butter, everything changed!
I hope you have a corntastic day (A corntastic day?)
What? It's just a pun about corn, okay? (Woo)
It's corn!
When it's like negative in the world
Take the corn break! (Corn break)
Take the corn break! (Corn dance!)
(Mmm corn)
Ippety, bibbly, diddly-bop (Corn dance)
Anything else you wanna say about corn before we go?
Yeah
What?
It's corn!
A big lump with knobs
It has the juice (it has the juice)
I can't imagine a more beautiful thing (Woo)
It's corn!
I can tell you all about it
I mean, look at this thing
When I tried it with butter, everything changed!
It's corn!
A big lump with knobs
It has the juice (it has the juice)
I can't imagine a more beautiful thing (Woo)
It's corn!
I can tell you all about it
I mean, look at this thing
When I tried it with butter, everything changed!
It's corn!
