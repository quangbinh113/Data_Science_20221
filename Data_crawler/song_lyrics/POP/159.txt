Song Name: I'm Yours
Well, you done, done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate, no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (hey, hey)

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our Godforsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate, no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
Do you, do, do, do you
But do you, do you, do, do
But do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soon da-ba-ba-ba-ba-bum
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-whoa-whoa
Uh-huh, hmm
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate, no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh, this, oh, this is our fate
I'm yours
Brr-ba-mmm, da-ba-mmm-day
T-du, du, t-du, du, t-du, du, du, du, du-du-du
Hmm-mm, oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, hmm
