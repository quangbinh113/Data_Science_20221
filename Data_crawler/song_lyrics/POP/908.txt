Song Name: Darwin Derby
Gotta be an early birdy if you want that worm
Gotta get your feathers dirty
You can't wait your turn
Gotta kick the drum like Pretty Purdie
And the track will burn
Gotta win your heat in the Darwin Derby
That's your main concern
That's your main concern, yeah
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin'
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin'
Gotta be an early birdy if you want that worm
Gotta get your feathers dirty
You can't wait your turn
Gotta kick the drum like Pretty Purdie
And the track will burn
Gotta win your heat in the Darwin Derby
That's your main concern
That's your main concern, yeah
Shine up your fins and show your teeth
Shake off your skin and clap your feet
Open your wings and start to fly
It's a beautiful day to be alive, alright
Of all the creatures in the sea
My favorite is the bass
It climbs up all the rocks and trees
And slides down on its hands and knees
But why does the shark have teeth?
The shark has teeth to eat, I see
And why does the whale have feet?
Well it- I don't know
Gotta be an early birdy if you want that worm
Gotta get your feathers dirty
You can't wait your turn
Gotta kick the drum like Pretty Purdie
And the track will burn
Gotta win your heat in the Darwin Derby
That's your main concern
That's your main concern, yeah
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin'
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' (Yeah)
You-o-o-oh, gonna party with you, gonna party with you, uh
You-o-o-oh, gonna party with me, gonna party with me, aye-ee
You-o-o-oh, gonna party with you, party with you, uh
You-o-o-oh, gonna party with me, gonna party with me
Shine up your fins and show your teeth
Shake off your skin and clap your feet
Open your wings and start to fly
It's a beautiful day to be alive, alright
Gotta be an early birdy if you want that worm
Gotta get your feathers dirty
You can't wait your turn
Gotta kick the drum like Pretty Purdie
And the track will burn
Gotta win your heat in the Darwin Derby
That's your main concern
That's your main concern, yeah
Shine up your fins and show your teeth
Shake off your skin and clap your feet
Open your wings and start to fly
It's a beautiful day to be alive, alright
