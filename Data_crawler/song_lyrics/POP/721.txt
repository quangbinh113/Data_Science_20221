Song Name: Chasing Your Shadow
I'd like to watch you from afar
I know you don't like it
You don't know someone might really love you
It could happen even from the outer space
There's nothing i can do
I don't think it will do
You might love someone that really really close to you
There's nothing i can do
I don't think it will do
You might love someone that really really close to you
I try to chasing your shadow
In the deep of my heart i really love you
I never know if it will reach you
Ooo i try to chasing your shadow
In the deep of my heart i really love you
I never know if i can reaching you
I just can only pray and try
Oh my lady, oh my lady please try me, try me
Oh my lady, oh my lady please try me, oh baby baby please, please try me
