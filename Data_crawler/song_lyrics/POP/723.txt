Song Name: Fire Flower
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Taking off this evening to fight this winter day
Brokenhearted I've been, I'll leave it on the land to stay
I've got an island in my back-pocket, lookin' for a way to find love anyday
I'll spend the holiday inside these sapphire waves as the sunset's sinkin' away
Light the night
Starry-eyed
Waved goodbye
So long, this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one my heart's dreaming of
Shallow glasses breaking, the longing never ends
Letting go of ways that we changed, still I pretend
I've got an island in my back-pocket, lookin' for a way to find love anyday
I'll spend the holiday inside these sapphire waves as the sunset's surfin' away
Ba--ba-ya-ohh
Ba--ba-ya-ohh
Ba--ba-ya-ohh
Light the night
Starry-eyed
Waved goodbye
So long, this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one my heart's dreaming of
Turn to dark
Fire flower
Don't pass me by
I've waiting all the years to find the tears falling from everything my heart could dream of
Do, do, do...
