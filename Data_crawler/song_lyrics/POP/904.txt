Song Name: Believe It or Not (Theme from "Greatest American Hero")
Look at what's happened to me
I can't believe it myself
Suddenly, I'm up on top of the world
It should have been somebody else
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me
Just like the light of a new day
It hit me from out of the blue
Breakin' me out of the spell I was in
Makin' all of my wishes come true
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me
This is too good to be true
Look at me
Fallin' for you
(Believe it or not)
(Believe it or not)
(Believe it or not)
(Believe it or not)
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
