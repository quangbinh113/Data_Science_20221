Song Name: Shinin’ You, Shinin’ Day
When I wake up in the morning
Sunshine through the window from the sky
Then I make up my mind
What I've got to do for you in this life
In my life
I need you all the time
I've gotta love,
I've gotta love shinin' you
I found your heart in the bright
We must be children
What you think about it I want your power I've got it
Shinin' you shinin' day
Shinin' you shinin' day
When you're crying, it's a rainy day
But, you try to make me have a happy time
Love somebody
Sing a song with a smiling face, feeling good
Nothing wrong with a shiny day, shinin' day
I need you all the time I know you make me smile
I found your heart in the bright
We must be children
What you think about it
I want your power I've got it
Shinin' you shinin' day
Shinin' you shinin' day
