Song Name: broken
I'm broken, tell you I'm fine
But you wouldn't believe me
If you knew the things that crossed my mind
And I'm hurting, but I show no sign
'Cause I'm afraid to give in, break down and waste your time
(Two, three)
Now I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire
Come and save me like you did when we were young
Oh please come bring me up from my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?
I'm lonely, it's been so long
Since I've felt loved, smiled, felt strong
And what can I do when I'm not friends with my reflection
When I don't understand affection like you do
(Two, three)
I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire
Come and save me like you did when we were young
Oh please come bring me up from my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?
You say that you'll help me, tell me I'm worth it
But I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
It's easy for you 'cause you know you're perfect
And I need your hand but I don't want to burn it
There's blood on the counter and tears on the pages
While I write you a letter and then I quickly erase it
I'm shattered and beat down, broken and weak now
So I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire
Come quickly, 'cause I'm burning up inside
Ooh please just bring me up from my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?
Pull me out
Pull me out
Pull me
