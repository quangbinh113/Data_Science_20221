Song Name: No Money
Sorry I ain't got no money I'm not trying to be funny
But I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down, you might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away (run away, run away)
This time
This time
This time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run...
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Sorry I ain't got no money I'm not trying to be funny
But I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down, you might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away (run away, run away)
This time
This time
This time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run, run...
Not this time
(Run, run, run, run, run...)
Not this time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
