Song Name: Fall In Love Alone
I'm familiar with unrequited
I know you got a heart that's undecided just like mine
It takes its sweet time
I been tryin' to dive into the deep end
'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend, but I might
Find something divine
It's electric every time we touch
I've been livin' for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much
If we never try
How will we know?
Baby, how far this thing could go
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind
I don't wanna fall in love alone
I wish that I could tell what you were thinkin'
I hate that I slip up when I've been drinkin', but oh, well
I can't help myself
I'm gettin' really tired of this back and forth
Why don't we just give in to this drivin' force, I mean
There's somethin' between us
It's electric every time we touch
I've been livin' for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much
If we never try
How will we know?
Baby, how far this thing could go
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind (do you mind a chair on my mind?)
I don't want to fall in love alone (I don't wanna fall in love alone)
If we never try (I don't want to fall in love alone)
How will we know? (Oh, yeah)
Baby, how far this thing could go (just how far this thing will go)
Give me a sign (give me a sign, a sign)
If I'm on your mind
I don't wanna fall in love alone
Ooh...
Fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love alone (get a seat here, girl, right here, next to me)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (next to me, next to me)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I don't wanna live without you, baby, anymore)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (anymore)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I-I-I can't be alone)
Fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love alone
