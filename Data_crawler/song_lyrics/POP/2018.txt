Song Name: After Last Night (with Thundercat & Bootsy Collins)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) mmh
Damn, I don't even who I was last night (ooh, ooh, ooh)
There's just somethin' about you (ooh)
You just made me feel, mmh (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh) was it good for you?
Ooh, baby
Now I don't know what you did, when you did, what you did
But you did it, girl
See, normally I don't stutter
But you d-d-d-d-do it to me (Silk Sonic)
Wishin' on a shootin' star, say a prayer for me
And hope it comes true
Ooh-woo-woo-woo (ah, yeah)
Throw my phone out the window, there's no player in me
Those days are through (those days are over, baby)
Ooh-woo-woo-woo (uh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (wait a minute now)
(Ooh) you put it on me like I never felt before
(Ooh) that gushy, gushy good, girl, I want some more
(Ooh) sweet, sticky, thick and pretty
You changed the game (what'd you do?)
After last night
After last night, I think I'm in love with you
(I think I'm in love with you)
Woke up and I can't get you out of my head
(I've tried, I've tried, come on)
After last night, I don't know what to do
(Baby, you've got to tell me)
When I'm gon' see you again
(Ah, suki, suki now)
If I still had my phone, I'd call every girl I know
And tell them goodbye
Ah, bye-bye (uh, toodle-doo, ooh)
Cars, clothes, diamonds, and gold
Anything you want, anyplace you want
We'll fly, fly, yeah

(Ooh) you put it on me like I never felt before
(Ooh) that gushy, gushy good, girl, I want some more
(Ooh) sweet, sticky, thick and pretty
You changed the game
After last night
After last night (woo), I think I'm in love with you
(I think I'm in love with you)
Woke up and I can't get you out of my head
(I've tried, I've tried, come on)
After last night, I don't know what to do
(Baby, you've got to tell me)
When I'm gon' see you again (mm, mm, mm)
(Sock it to me one more time, come on)
Ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ooh, yeah (sing)
Ah-ya-ya, ah (Silk Sonic, sing)
Ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ooh, yeah (uh, here I come, baby)
Ah-ya-ya, ah (here I come, girl, oh-oh, ooh)
(After) after last night (last night)
I think I'm in love with you (I think I, I think I'm in love with you)
Woke up and I can't get you out of my head
(I woke up this mornin' and you're runnin' through my mind, baby)
After last night (after last night, baby), I don't know what to do
(Oh, you got to, got to tell me)
When I'm gon' see you again (ah, yeah, baba)
