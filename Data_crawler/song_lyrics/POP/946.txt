Song Name: Skate
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes, you would be a hundred dollars
If being fine was a crime, girl, they'd lock your lil' fine ass up in a tower
The way you move like you do, ooh, it's like you do it for a living
Do a lil' spin, do it again, shit
Look like you playing for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No-no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (skate)
Slide your way on over (slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (skate)
Uh, I wanna get to know ya (I wanna get to know ya)
Come on

Oh my, oh my
Got your hair in the wind, and your skin glistening
I can smell your sweet perfume
(Mmm, you smell better than a barbecue)
Oh, superstar is what you are
I'm your biggest fan, if you're looking for a man, sugar, here I am
(Ooh) I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
(I'ma tryna ride with you, darling)
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
Oh, no-no, don't be shy, just take my hand, and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (skate)
Slide your way on over (slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me baby (skate)
I, I wanna get to know ya (I wanna get to know ya)
I never fall, but tonight, you got me falling for you
And only you, you
I'm reaching out in hopes that you reach for me too
Girl, let's groove
Girl, you got me singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My, oh my (my, oh my)
My, oh my (my, oh my)
Oh, skate to me, baby (skate)
Come on, slide your way on over (slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (skate)
I-I, I wanna get to know you, girl (I wanna get to know you)
Skate to me, my baby (skate)
Just slide your way on over (slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, my baby (skate)
I wanna get to know ya (I wanna get to know ya)
