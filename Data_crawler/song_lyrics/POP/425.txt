Song Name: Perfect Duet (Ed Sheeran & Beyonc√©)
I found a love for me
Oh darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darlin', just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight
Well I found a man, stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
Well baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
