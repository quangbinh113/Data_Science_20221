Song Name: Scenic Drive (feat. Ari Lennox & Smino)
Yeah, yeah (ah, ah, ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Hours seem to go too fast when I'm with you
Just watch it all go past when I'm with you
And that's the usual, but I love what we got goin' on
It's best I let you know, woah (ooh-ah)
I just hope that I don't crash when I'm with you
It's like I'm on my last when I'm with you
I see you're down for me
Gotta keep the windows rolled up 'til it gets hard to breathe
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Might just do the dash when I'm with you
Climb up on your lap, put it in cruise
So incredible (yeah), and I shifted lanes, you the realest one on the coast
Body drippin' like a spring when I'm with you (you)
We're electricity, don't need no fuse (fuse)
Makin' you lose control
Doin' donuts on it, keep it going 'til you can't no more (can't no more, hey)
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin' (you got me feelin')
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin' (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin' (oh, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby (baby)
I love her if I love at all
I don't need no award, no applaud, uh-huh
Just take
Tell me a time and a place and I promise I'll make an appointment
I never been one to be chasin' no woman
I fuck 'round and treat to do time
My forces, I fuck 'round it, uh
Back to the drawing board, bored drunk got da Lauryn on
Love, long as a corridor
Word, lil' baby my favorite chore
Sure, other dudes had before
I did, but I don't give a fuck 'bout nobody or no bodies
Yellow big face on the watch look like Sade
My nigga got a ride in the back, she got shotty
Comme des Gar√ßons, your name
Sweater like crazy (ooh, ooh)
Love me out loud, L-O-L
'Cause you my baby (mm)
Cracked a whole tooth, you so sweet
My friends ain't seen me for weeks
I highway chase your heart at high speed, na-na-na
You like it when I'm chasin'
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (it feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin' (when we're just blazin')
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
