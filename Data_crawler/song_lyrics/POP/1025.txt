Song Name: SCAR (Prod. BOYCOLD)
You know that I will be back from a war
From a place inside my head
Coming back with a scar on my face
With my bruises on place, with my mind rearranged (hey, boy, it's Cold)
여긴 어디지? (어디지?)
I've been looking for a place for me to keep me (keep me)
너무 멀어진 내 자신과의 또 greet and meet (greet and meet)
You maybe loved me, but why do you have to leave me?
모든 게 쉽지 않아 왜냐면 난 그냥 빙신
I gotta keep you away
That might be the reason that you always said to me
모든 게 달라졌네
이젠 그만 끝내야지 말이 되는 case
문제보다 조금 더 큰 거
일수도 근데 믿진 말어
Always lying 'bout the shit that you made up
Broke a heart, and you left me, you gave up
You know that I will be back from a war
From a place inside my head
Coming back with a scar on my face
With my bruises on place, with my mind rearranged
Uh, you on that shit again
What happened to the promise that you wouldn't trip again?
I thought you said that you would stop give me lip again
But then you sip again, and then you nip again
Hey, how'd you get up in my head again?
The way you looked up in my bed was even better than
All of your friends that's popping up in my DM's again
When will it ever end? Well, it won't never end
Hey, I know you think you all that
That's why you never call back
Good looks, bad heart, what you call that?
I think it's time to fall back
'Cause you thinking 'bout leaving me
Seen the look up in your eyes, ain't no deceiving me
Just remember it was you that always needed me
And not the other way around, so I'ma keep the peace
You know that I will be back from a war
From a place inside my head
Coming back with a scar on my face
With my bruises on place, with my mind rearranged
