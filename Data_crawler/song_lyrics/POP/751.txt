Song Name: Vanilla
Vanilla
First time I met you in America
You showed me the way to your lonely Mars
Where I tumbled down
Where I fall apart
Would you let me call your name, Vanilla
Later you moved to Venezuela
Morphing to flowers blossom in the park
I begged the sun for
Keeping you unharmed
Would you let me climb on your stems
And pick up all your gems
I'll seed it in the sand
Could be November, you'll understand
Next time we meet won't be too long await
Vanilla
Are you flying alone to Florida?
Storms on the radar
It's raining hard tonight
I'll be the shelter in your abandoned yard
It's last time I call your name, Vanilla
I was the pilot of the shooting star
I've been to places
Now on your lonely Mars
Weaving villa in the dark
