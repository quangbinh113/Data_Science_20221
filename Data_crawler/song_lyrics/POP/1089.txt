Song Name: Show Me Love
Show me love
Show me what it really is
Tell me with your fingertips
Show me love
Sweet, sweet love
Whisper me your fetishes
Kill me with your tenderness
Show me love
I gotta make up for the nights
I wasted dancing in the dark
Need something more than my imagination
Even if it breaks my heart
Keep me up
If you're down
Show me love
Make it good
Baby, tie me down, no strings
I don't need no fancy things
Show me love
So, so good
Oh, the other bitches die for it
Good hеaven, make me cry for it
Show mе love
I gotta make up for the nights
I wasted dancing in the dark
Need something more than my imagination
Even if it breaks my heart
Keep me up
If you're down
Show me love
Sh-sh-sh-sh-show me love
Wilder than your wildest dreams
Weirder than your fantasies
Show me love
Sweet, sweet love
Something I just can't resist
Stay here for a while for this and
Show me love
