Song Name: The Ballet Girl
She works at a bar but she's too young to have a drink
Paying for her mother's alcohol and colored pills
Never see her father, but he taught her the ballet
One night she packed her bags and ran away
Oh oh oh
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
Toes bleeding out on the floor (mmm)
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
As she moves adagio
Woah oh oh
She's beauty and grace
She's floating on stage
Her happiest days
With a smile on her face
Her memory stained
By the songs on replay
And now she's dancing alone
And now she's dancing alone
Fetishised by every man in town
Roses fill the opera
Hypnotized but when the curtain falls
She's only safe in the applause
(Woah oh oh)
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
Toes bleeding out on the floor (mmm)
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
As she moves adagio
Woah oh oh
She's beauty and grace
She's floating on stage
Her happiest days
With a smile on her face
Her memory stained
By the songs on replay
And now she's dancing alone
And now she's dancing alone
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
Toes bleeding out on the floor (mmm)
Oh now she's dancing alone (mmm)
As she moves adagio
Woah oh oh
She's beauty and grace
She's floating on stage
Her happiest days
With a smile on her face
Her memory stained
By the songs on replay
And now she's dancing alone
And now she's dancing alone
