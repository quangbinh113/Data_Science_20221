Song Name: Treat Me
You know you'll go broke tryna handle me
Take it from someone who know how to handle me
I'ma need that real grown kinda energy, ah
Do you know? Do you know?
'Cause you're dealing with a lotta competition
You're gonna have to do a lotta ass kissing
You know I got someone with the time to listen
Tell me, boy, do you know? Do you know?
(I, I, I, I, I) do it every night, show me a good time
You can too, I'll let you try, try, try, try, try (oh)
This right here your chance, learn it from the best
Here's what you gotta do
Treat me like I treat me (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
And you know I do it right (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
Love me like I love me, completely and deeply, now
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, treat me like I treat me
Exceptional
You know anything less is unacceptable
Don't get me wrong, I'm flexible
But only in all the ways my legs can go
Confessional, I'm skeptical
'Cause being on my level is difficult
You better wake up and put me on a pedestal
I bet you know, I know, do you know?
(I, I, I, I, I) do it every night, show me a good time
You can too, I'll let you try, try, try, try, try (oh, oh)
This right here your chance (chance), learn it from the best (the best)
Here's what you gotta do
Treat me like I treat me (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
And you know I do it right (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice (booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
Love me like I love me, completely and deeply, now
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me (treat me, baby)
And you know I do it right (and you know I do it right)
Treat me like I treat me (oh-oh-oh)
Oh, I make me feel so nice (oh-oh-oh)
Treat me like I treat me
Love me like I love me, completely and deeply now
Now (ooh), treat me like I treat me
