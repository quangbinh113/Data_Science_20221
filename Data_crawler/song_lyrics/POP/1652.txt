Song Name: Come on over Baby (All I Want Is You) - Radio Version
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby (here we go)
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey boy, don't you know?
I've got something goin' on
I've got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long
I know you know
So baby don't
Pretend you won't
Keep me guessing if you
You will or you won't
Don't want to play the game with you, baby
So listen to me
(All I want is you)
Come over here baby
(All I want is you)
You know you make me go crazy
(All I want is you)
Now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
I'm not just talkin' about your sexuality (your sexuality)
But I can't help myself when you put your hands on me
(When you put your hands on me)
Ooh whoa, ooh
It's paradise when you and I (it's paradise)
Get close, get tight (yeah)
One on one, I wanna go all, all night (all night)
I wanna play that game with you baby (yeah)
Listen to me
(All I want is you)
Come over here baby
(All I want is you)
You know you make me go crazy
(All I want is you)
Now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Don't you wanna be the one tonight?
We could do exactly what you like
Don't you wanna be just you and me?
We could do what comes so naturally
I got a thing for you
Got my mind made up
And I'm serious, never been more, baby
I'm sure that it's real (so sure)
And it's right here, come on
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on, come on, come on over
(You give me)
What a girl feels, what a girl likes
What a girl needs, what a girl wants
All I, all I want is you
Whoa baby
(All I want is you) oh you make me go crazy, oh, whoa
(All I want is you) now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
(All I want is you) oh yeah, whoa
(All I want is you) you make me go crazy, you
(All I want is you) now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
