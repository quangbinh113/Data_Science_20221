Song Name: Signs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (No)
I'm going on them once I get going (No-no)
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Like Lisa
You need a
Money and Visa
And you get what you want
Always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please"
I can't say "No"
How you shine
You need a
Baby with me, uh
And I'm taking my time
Just wait on me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please"
I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini
Yeah, you want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie
Yeah, vacation's done but I'm not finished, no
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
Can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (No)
I'm going on them once I get going (No-no)
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I stay to myself
I'll explain myself
I can't play myself
Oh, first night
Holy night
Five in the morning, yeah
And it feels like you're mine
Signs of the times
Oh, what a time
Playing it right, playing it perfect
Laughing it off but I know you're hurting
Signs of the times
I say all the time
Taking my time just gets harder to find it
But you're playing it right, you're playing me perfect
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
