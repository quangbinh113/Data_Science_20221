Song Name: Head Shoulders Knees & Toes (feat. Norma Jean Martine)
I feel it in my head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
Your music gets me through the highs and lows
My head, shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
I've been praying to a thousand different stars
To a thousand different arms 'til I found you
I've been chasing 'bout a thousand different hearts
For a thousand million hours, now I've found you
My nights will never be the same, the same again
I've got you running through my veins
I feel it in my head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
Your music gets me through the highs and lows
My head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
Let me breathe you, take you down into my lungs
While we're dancing to the song, now that I've found you
You're a part of me, now I can't let you go
You're the heartbeat in my soul, now that I've found you
My nights will never be the same, the same again
I've got you running through my veins
I feel it in my head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
Your music gets me through the highs and lows
My head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
I feel it in my head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
Your music gets me through the highs and lows
My head, my shoulders, knees and toes, my bones
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
You're keeping me from feeling all alone
