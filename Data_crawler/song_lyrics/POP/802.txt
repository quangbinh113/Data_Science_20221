Song Name: A New Day feat. Phum Viphurit
I, yeah, I've been feeling lonely
I wonder if you hear me?
Calling to the night
It's not right, this life in isolation
What if tomorrow never comes?
I just wanna be all right, all right?
Lately, I've been lost in thoughts
Thinking about what's above
What will it take to feel the love?
Then I arise a new day
My head held high, I'll find my way
My friend, I'll pinky promise you
I'll find you, let's
Pull the puppet strings out
Don't be afraid
I'll be your parachute
It's time to sneak out the room
Why don't you come back tonight?
Lately, we've been lost in thoughts
Thinking about what's above
What will it take to feel the love?
Lately, we've been lost in thoughts
Thinking about what's above
What will it take to feel the love?
Then we arise a new day
When the time comes, see you there
