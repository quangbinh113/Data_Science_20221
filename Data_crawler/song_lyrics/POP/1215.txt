Song Name: Your Love (9PM)
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
You can make me let go
Forget about the world for a while
You had me at a "Hello"
I'm drowning in the blue of your eyes
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So, tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
