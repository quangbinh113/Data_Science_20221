Song Name: Plume
I hear Allie laugh
It's so far away
I want to know her
Should I even try
As soon
As I arrive
She holds silver balloons
And floats away
Cast a glow
Overhead
Piece by piece
We peel apart
I'll divide
You'll sidewind
Promise to
Be all that was
In the lighter hours
Hardly happier
She wears her hair
Up like the others
Under the shade
She waits until
They go again
