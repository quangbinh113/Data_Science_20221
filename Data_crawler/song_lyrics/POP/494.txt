Song Name: Blurred Lines
Everybody get up
Everybody get up (hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Tune me up
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Everybody get up
Okay now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal, baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you (hey, hey, hey)
You don't need no papers (hey, hey, hey)
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me
Everybody get up
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on?
What do we need steam for?
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky (hey, hey, hey)
You wanna hug me (hey, hey, hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (Hey, hey, hey)
Okay now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you (hey, hey, hey)
You don't need no papers (hey, hey, hey)
That man is not your maker (hey, hey, hey)
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
Everybody get up
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me (Hustle gang, homie)
Must wanna get nasty (let go, ay say Rob)
Go ahead, get at me (let me holla at 'em real quick)
One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to (come on)
Go from Malibu to Paris, boo (yeah)
Had a bitch but she ain't bad as you
So hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean it's almost unbearable (everybody get up)
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watchin' and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin' (okay)
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused, get pimpin'
Shake your rump, get down, get up
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What, you don't like work?
Hey (everybody get up)
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me, Dakota to Decatur (uh-huh)
No more pretending (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause now you winning (hey, hey, hey)
Here's our beginning (hey, hey, hey)
I always wanted a good girl
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me (yeah)
You're far from plastic (alright)
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines (everybody get up)
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it (oh yeah)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
