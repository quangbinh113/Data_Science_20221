Song Name: Kick It to Me
I know we used to have a lot of bad days
My stomach got to hurting in the worst way
Singing the blues, all on my own in a dark room
Nobody there, all on my own in a dark room
Nowadays we got a lot of good news
You finally kicked the cigarettes, I ain't been
Singing the blues nearly as much
Since I been living with you, love me too much
And I say
Kick it to me, I could make it better for ya
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Oh, kick it to me, I could make it better for ya
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Mmm, kick it to me, I could make it better for you
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Oh, kick it to me, I could make it better for ya
Make it better, it's all better
I know we didn't think that it would turn out
You start it off too quick, you're gonna burn out
Turn in, you send her home when the night comes
Let her go, send her home when the night comes
Nowadays we're headed to the same place
Nowadays we're working at the same pace
I'm still here still bright when the night comes
Still burning, still bright when the night comes
Kick it to me and I'll make it better for ya
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Oh, kick it to me, I could make it better for ya
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Mmm, kick it to me, I could make it better for you
Kick it to me, I could make you better for it
Oh, kick it to me, I could make it better for ya
Make it better, 'cause it's all better
I didn't feel it on the first day
But now I got it in the worst way
And don't it feel alright?
I get it bad and it gets better every day
I didn't think it was a good look, no
You get too worried how it could look
And don't it feel okay?
I get it bad and it gets better every day
And If I open the gates
And I let it in the light
You're gonna get all of me or none at all
You're gonna get all of me or none at all
And if walking away
Ain't letting you go, no, no
I'm gonna get all of you or none at all
I wanna get all of you or none at all
I didn't feel it on the first day
But now I got it in the worst way, ooh, ahh
Don't it feel okay?
I get it bad and it gets better every day
I didn't think it was a good look, no
You get too worried how it could look, no
Oh, and don't it feel okay?
I get it bad and it gets better every day
I didn't feel it on the first day
And now I got it in the worst way
Oh, baby, don't it feel alright?
He's got me feeling better every single day
I didn't think it was a good look
You get too worried how it could look
And don't it feel okay?
I get it bad and it gets better every day, no, no, no
