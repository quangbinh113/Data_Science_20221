Song Name: Beautiful Day
It's such a beautiful day, why are you so blue?
Hey it's been too long that you shut your heart out
Well i know it's true, sometimes love can hurt
So give it some time, one day you'll be fine
It's such a beautiful day, why you're still frownin'?
Hey it's been too long
To contemplate about on
How to deal with your broken heart all over again
Till you can't feel the love
Oh when the sun comes after rain
You will live again
Feeling love again
Love sometimes goes unseen
What you see on the screen
Are not always what it seems
It's such a beautiful day, let's celebrate it
Hey it's been so long
Since the last time you let the birds sing and fly around you
To make you believe that you can also fly
Cause when the sun comes after rain
You will live again
Feeling love again
Love sometimes goes unseen
What you see on the screen
Are not always what it seems
(Cause aaa aaaaa)
It's such a beautiful day, let's celebrate it
(You will live again, feeling love again)
(You will live again, oh feeling love again)
It's such a beautiful day, let's celebrate it
(Not always what it seems)
(To make you believe that you can also fly)
