Song Name: P.S. I LOVE YOU
The only place I call home
You are
Every hope and dream I've ever had
You are
In other lifetimes, without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you
Like a cool breeze on a summer day
You are
Like a brightest star up in the sky
Girl, you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what I am looking for
I love you (love you ooh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one
I love you (I do)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises that I'll fulfill
My only one (my only lovе)
The only place I call home
You arе
Every hope and dream I've ever had
You are
In other lifetimes, without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you
Like a cool breeze on a summer day
You are
Like a brightest star up in the sky
Girl, you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what I am looking for

Ooh, I love you (love you ooh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one
I love you (I do)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises that I'll fulfill
My only one (my only love)
My only one (my only love)
