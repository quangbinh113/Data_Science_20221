Song Name: Stranger
So what if this is it?
What if it falls apart in front of my face?
I wouldn't be surprised
'Cause it happens every time
And now I'm feeling sick
Doing all these things that just push you away
Baby, tell me, why
Do I do this every time?
I'm no good at loving you
But I'll try time and time again
Kiss me now and tell me why
You're still here
'Cause I'm no stranger to loving
I'm no stranger to falling apart
No stranger to secrets, and monsters and demons
I'm scared of the dark
I'm no stranger to fighting
I'm no stranger to playing with hearts
No stranger to secrets, and monsters and demons
I'm scared of thе dark
What if this is it? Yeah
Drunk on a Saturday night, mm
Suddenly your hand fits perfеctly in mine, yeah
All my fears and all my thoughts
You see through, through it all
Kiss me now and tell me why
You're still here
'Cause I'm no stranger to loving
I'm no stranger to falling apart
No stranger to secrets, and monsters and demons
I'm scared of the dark
I'm no stranger to fighting
I'm no stranger to playing with hearts
No stranger to secrets, and monsters and demons
I'm scared of the dark
So leave the light on
Leave the light on
So leave the light on
Leave the light on
'Cause I'm no stranger to loving
I'm no stranger to falling apart
No stranger to secrets, and monsters and demons
I'm scared of the dark
