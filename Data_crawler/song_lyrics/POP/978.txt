Song Name: Last Call
Search for what will set you free
It's not 2017 anymore
So you trust in a guy like me
To give you everything in store

We'll be riding 'round drop top when it gets hot
Doing donuts in an empty lot like whoa
I'll give you the finer things
Suddenly there's nothing worth comparing to your soul
Where do we go? Where do we stand?
In-between a quick romance, something that'll last long
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, something like a last call

If this is worth it, I'm guessing that we'll both find out in the end
You show me purpose and give me presence that I've never met
In this world full of hatred, somehow I feel your innocence
I'll be patient, impatient, and I'll be patient, impatient
We'll be riding 'round drop top when it gets hot
Doing donuts in an empty lot like whoa
I'll give you the finer things
Suddenly there's nothing worth comparing to your soul
Tell me, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we stand?
In-between a quick romance, something that'll last long
('Cause it don't last long, no)
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, something like a last call
Where do we start? Where do we start? Where do we start?
Where do we start? Where do we start? Where do we start?
Where do we go? Where do we start?
In-between a quick romance, something that'll last long
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, something like a last call
