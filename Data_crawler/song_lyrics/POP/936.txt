Song Name: Rich Girl
You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
It's a bitch, girl, but you're gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Get you too far
And don't you know
Don't you know, yeah
That it's wrong, ooh, to take what is given you?
So far gone, on your own, yeah
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong
Oh, you're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
It's a bitch, girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Oh, say money, but it won't get you too far
Get you too far
Rich girl
Rich girl

Rich girl
Rich girl
Rich girl
High and dry and out of the rain, yeah
Oh, it's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh
You're a rich girl (rich girl), and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
It's a bitch, girl (bitch, girl), but you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (bitch, girl)
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Get you too far
And you say
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
You're a rich girl (a rich girl), a rich girl
You're a rich girl, yeah, oh, no
You're a rich girl, yeah
You're, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
You're a rich girl (rich girl), and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Well, you can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
You're a rich girl (rich girl), you're a rich girl
Oh-oh, you're a rich bitch girl, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, you're a rich girl (rich girl) and you're gone
Yeah, yeah
