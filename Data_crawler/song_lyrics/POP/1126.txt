Song Name: alone in a room full of people
I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end
Hurtin' each other since 2018
You got me anxious again, so I'm stuck in my sheets
You had me so high, now I'm on one percent
You plugged me in and tug me in, you showed me how to pretend
I hope your happy, even though you don't look it with him
Had to archive every photo like it didn't exist
Now every summer, I just think about the times that I miss
Not to mention all the friends that I lost ever since
And I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end
Yeah
A hundred missed calls, and I don't wanna pick up
'Cause when you say, you'll hit me back, you hit me back in a month
And I don't wanna leave the crib, and I don't wanna get lunch
'Cause everything I love doing, it just lost all its fun
And you made me feel disgusting 'bout the things that I've done
Gave me a hundred chances, I fucked up every one
Reminiscing 'bout a past that I can never outrun
I been looking 'round this room, and I don't fuck with anyone
'Cause I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end
And we only hurt each other in the end
And we only hurt each other in the end
