Song Name: Flowers
Took me over to your house to meet your family
Introduced me to them sayin' that you'd marry me
Then you'd look me in the eye and say, "It's just a joke"
Then you'd kiss me, and I'd smile, did you even know?
When you'd say that kinda thing, I'd be excited
Got me hopin' maybe one day you would mean it
Always thought I'd only make a fool of someone else
Now you've only gone and made me make one of myself
I guess the flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we fight, you'd give me space, and not communicate
And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head, now I know, wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you
I was gettin' any flight, so we could make it work
You'd ignore me, could've told me you were seeing her
Kinda hate myself for justifying your mistakes
Took a minute, but I learned that shit the hard way
Who are you to tell me I can't be heartbroken?
Babe, you had the chance, the door for you was open
If it's what you need to tell yourself to sleep at night
Pretend I haven't found a man who finally treats me right
I guess the flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more cautious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we fight, you'd give me space, and not communicate
And for a while I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head, now I know wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you
If there's anything I've learned, it's you should watch yourself
If it's hurting you, then leave and go and get some help
