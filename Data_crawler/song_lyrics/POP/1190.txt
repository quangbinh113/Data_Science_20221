Song Name: Fingers Crossed
Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the morning
When you got home from work
Making plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
All love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you
Now I remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice
Just tryna fix you and all your daddy issues
But now I don't even miss you anymore
So I, I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you love me
While you must've had your fingers crossed
Should've paid attention to my friends
Telling me how bad it's gonna end
Always giving their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened
I could say, "I'm sorry", but I'm not
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost
Now I remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice
Just tryna fix you and all your daddy issues
But now I don't even miss you anymore
So I, I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you love me
While you must've had your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) oh, when you said you love me
While you must've had your fingers crossed
So I, I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
Wish you said you loved me
When you didn't have your fingers crossed
