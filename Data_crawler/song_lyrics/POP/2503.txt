Song Name: Sharks
Trouble, blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive
Levels, better put your head on swivels
Dancing with the very devil
Butter to knife
You think you're better than them, better than them
You think they're really your friends, really your friends
But when it comes to the end, to the end
You're just the same as them, same as them
So let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes
First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark
Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks
He's coming to get you
Chick-chicka-woo-woo
He's coming to get you
Get you, woo
Bubbles
Drowning, you seeing doubles
Don't you let them see your struggles
Hiding your tears
Crisis
Take advantage of your niceness
Cut you up in even slices
Prey on your fears
You think you're better than them, better than them (you think you're better)
You think they're really your friends, really your friends (really your)
But when it comes to the end, to the end (oh, no)
You're just the same as them, same as them
So let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes
First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark
Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks
(My-my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you (don't take it from me)
Woo-woo (my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you, get you (don't take it from me)
(My-my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you (don't take it from me)
Woo-woo (my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you, get you (don't take it from me)
Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe
I wonder if my day is gonna blame it on the entropy
My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything!
(Sharks!)
Don't take it from me
My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks!)
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything!
So let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes
First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark
Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks
(My-my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you (don't take it from me)
Woo-woo (my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you, get you (don't take it from me)
(My-my blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you (don't take it from me)
(My blood is pumping)
He's coming to get you, get you (don't take it from me)
