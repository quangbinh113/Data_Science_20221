Song Name: Grace
Tell me where to go
Turn on the radio
Of the city lights
Will you take me to the show?
To the places that we know
Drivin' through the night
Always everyday a sailor
Surfin' on the silver tide together now
Make us turn away from all the shackles and the pain
You know that all day I'll love you
I feel that I can't be feelin' lonely ever again
'Cause I know, I always was dreaming of a day like today
Why don't you tell me you're breaking away?
Why don't you tell me this cannot replay?
So tell me where to go!
Always everyday a sailor
Surfin' on the silver tide together now
Make us turn away from all the shackles and the pain
You know that all day I'll love you
I feel that I can't be feelin' lonely ever again
Cuz I know, I always was dreaming of a day like today
I feel that I can't be feelin' lonely ever again
Cuz I know, I always was dreaming of a day like today
Why don't you tell me you're breaking away?
Why don't you tell me this cannot replay?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you tell me?
So tell me where to go!
