Song Name: not my job anymore
I don't wanna make assumptions
But it looks like from the picture you posted
That you're actually unhappy
But you think that nobody can notice
And maybe it's all in my head
And maybe it's just 'cause I know you so well
But you don't stop lovin' someone just 'cause it's over
And I just wanna say, "Are you okay?"
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4 a.m., 'cause you can't stop cryin'
Drive you home when you get too drunk
And you say you're fine
But I know you're lyin'
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore
If I'm being honest, I know I made the right decision
It hurts lettin' go, but it hurt more keeping that position
'Cause I gave it all to you when you asked me to
But it some things I can't fix, no, some things I can't fix
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4 a.m., 'cause you can't stop cryin'
Drive you home when you get too drunk
And you say you're fine
But I know you're lyin'
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4 a.m., 'cause you can't stop cryin'
Drive you home when you get too drunk
And you say you're fine
But I know you're lyin'
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
But that's not my job anymore
