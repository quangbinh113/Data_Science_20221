Song Name: My Love Is Your Love
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
(Turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
If tomorrow is judgment day
(Sing mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line

And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
If I wake up in World War III
(World War, in World War III)
I see destruction and poverty

And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
'Cause your love is my love (My love)
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
If I lose my fame and fortune
(Really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (On the street)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (Okay)

It's okay, if you're sleeping with me
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
As the years they pass us by (Years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay, as long as I got you baby
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
(Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright)
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Is your love, baby)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
(Oh no, no, no)
And no matter what the people say
(It really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
'Cause your love (Love) is my love
And my love is your love (Your love)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us (Can't hold us)
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love (Is my love)
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us (Baby)
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
