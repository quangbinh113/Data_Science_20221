Song Name: C U When U Get There
Now I've seen places and faces and things
You ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking and smokin'
Pretending that you're lookin' but you're brokin' let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy 'cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down ass brother got replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dust's
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes I ain't trying preach
I believe I can reach but your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
More temptation and faith I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody getting lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it's way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter you rag colour, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak
I done strive my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there when you with the sound bumpin'
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that you busy trying stack
And keeping with the Joneses is taking advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when it's something wrong and we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
I know time seems right and the problems seem endless
But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
