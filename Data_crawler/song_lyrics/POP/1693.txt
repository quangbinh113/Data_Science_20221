Song Name: Don't Mess With My Man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Your hands off my man
He told your ass not once but twice
You should have took his advice
And left the man alone
You still drive by here every night
'Cause you're not wrapped too tight
And you let your mind explode
You had your chance
And you lost a good man
I know it's sad
Thinkin' 'bout what you had
If you was smart
Keep that ass off my block
Next time see me
I won't be a lady, no, no
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Your hands off my man
You bitched at him all night, all day
You constantly complained
'Til you drove the man away
Always saying something
Said he wasn't good for nothing
So tell me why the hell you stalking
You're just pissed, now get to walking
You had your chance
And you lost a good man
I know it's sad
Thinkin' 'bout what you had
If you was smart
Keep that ass out of my block
Next time see me
I won't be a lady, no no
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Your hands off my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Your hands off my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Your hands off my man
