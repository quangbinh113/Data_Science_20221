Song Name: Have A Little Faith In Me
When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark
And have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Whoa
When your secret heart

Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin', from a whisper start
To have a little faith in me
And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch, I will catch your fall, baby
Just have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith
