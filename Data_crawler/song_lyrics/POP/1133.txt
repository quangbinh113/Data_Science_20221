Song Name: Manila
Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
You're running circles 'round your heart
I know it's going to be real dark
I take a minute, light a spark
We can dance until the fall
Si te vienes conmigo, piénsatelo bien
Vamos a cien por hora un poco del revés
Porque cuando arrancamos ya no para el tren, eh
Mira que te lo cuento bien, y-eh-eh
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live, just a little bit?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we-
Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
And take a chance with me
And take a chance with me
Y si mezclamos mi cerveza y tu tequila
Hoy no hay controles de Berlín hasta Manila
Ay, tu sonrisa me parece poesía, yeh
Como te digo, como te digo yo
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live, just a little bit?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we-
Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
And take a chance with me
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live?
Why don't we live, just a little bit?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we stay?
Why don't we stay, just a little bit?
