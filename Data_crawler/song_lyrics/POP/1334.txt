Song Name: Middle
Staring at two different views on your window ledge

Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing floating down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)
Lying down beside you what's going through your head?

The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I can't say
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces, I'm just sure
We're gonna sweep it under the carpet
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)
(With you)
(You)
(Thank the children)
(Just thank the children)
(You)
(Thank the children)
(Just thank the children)
