Song Name: CUFF IT
I feel like fallin' in love (fallin' in love)

Hypersonic, sex erotic
On my body, boy, you got it
Hit them 'draulics while I ride it
Got me actin' hella thotty
So excited, so exotic
I'm a seasoned professional
Squeeze it, don't let it go
Tease it, no self-control

Oh, I (I got time today, I got time)
I can't wait to come out and play
Ooh, yeah, you
Come and cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, baby
While I buss it, buss it, buss it for you, baby
Oh, baby
Anywhere, anytime

For you (all for you)
A bitch'll get fucked up (I fuck you up)
For you (all for you)
I'm puttin' my cup up (put my cup up, yeah)
For you (all for you)
'Cause we gon' fuck up the night
Take flight, blindin' lights (yeah)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up

Bet you, you'll see stars
Bet you, you'll go far
Bet you, you'll levitate
Bet you, you'll meet God (party people, roll up)

Spaceships fly
Fuck it up, fuck it up
