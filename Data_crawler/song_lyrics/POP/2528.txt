Song Name: Obsessed (with Charlie Puth & Shenseea)
I miss you every single day
But you don't even look my way
I really wish you were
Obsessed with me
I miss you every single day
But you don't even know my name
I really wish you were
Obsessed with me
Not the regular degular
Gyal, weh yuh mix? (no) blunts?
Mi wi tek yuh high like di weed (hey)
Replacing feelings wid a bad Louis V (woo)
Suh, G, me a tell ya run da money (yes)

Hot gyal body look like it live inna gemini
Ain't gonna sob me to a man

With you and your paws
Woi, I need a big man (big)

Big mansion (yeah)
No apartment (oh yeah)
I keep it working, but it's loved
High hopes but it's all for nothing, yeah
I miss you every single day
But you don't even look my way
I really wish you were
Obsessed with me
I miss you every single day
But you don't even know my name
I really wish you were
Obsessed with me
You don't even notice
When I touch down in the city
I used to be top of your mind
My hope, you were holding close to you
When you are with me
But now someones taking your time
Baby, I'm waiting for you
To come to your senses
You say that you need me
Tell me, what are the chances?
Nah, oh, hey

Yeah!

But you don't even look my way
I really wish you were
Obsessed with me
