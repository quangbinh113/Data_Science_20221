Song Name: Seven
You and I, what a lie
Wasted time on a feeling
I wish I saw the signs
I was blind, it was thrilling (hn-hn)
Was it ever really love?
If the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hookup
With the one we told each other not to worry about
Was it really everything?
Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a fling
I'm starting to freak out
(Ha-ha-haa, ha-ha-haa)
Was it ever really love?
(Ha-ha-haa, ha-ha-haa)
Was it ever really?
Remember when you said you wanted me to go blonde
Well, now it makes sense that you ran right into her arms
I bet you think she's nice, I bet she's just your type
I can't blame you, guess we both got what we fantasized
Was it ever really love?
If the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hookup
With the one we told each other not to worry about
Was it really everything?
Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a fling
I'm starting to freak out
(Ha-ha-haa, ha-ha-haa)
Was it ever really love?
(Ha-ha-haa, ha-ha-haa)
Was it ever really love?
If the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hookup
With the one we told each other not to worry about
Was it really everything?
Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a, just a fling
