Song Name: Let Somebody Go
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
We've had that kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles
And we talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars 'cause this I know
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go
All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you what on earth am I to do?

When they call the mathematicians
And they ask them to explain
They say love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooh
(Let somebody, let somebody go) yeah, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, (oh) when you love somebody (oh)
When you love somebody (oh)
Got to let somebody know
Oh, oh-oh, (oh) when you love somebody (oh)
When you love somebody (oh)
Got to let somebody know
So, when you love somebody
When you love somebody
Then it hurts like so
To let somebody go
It hurts like so
To let somebody go
But you're still with me, now I know
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
Oh-oh-ooh (let somebody, let somebody go)
But you're still with me, now I know
