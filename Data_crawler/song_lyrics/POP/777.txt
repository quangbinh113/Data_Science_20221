Song Name: Shmoopie
I don't now why I try so hard
Stealing my slumber in your car
I can see your face going nowhere
I (I) don't (don't) want (want) to (to) be (be) close (close)
Cuz it's hard
And why you want your all face inside my HeartGold
It's not the same when we're both jaded
Don't call me shmoopie, you'll be heated
And I can see your face going nowhere
I (I) don't (don't) want (want) to (to) be (be) close (close)
Cuz it's hard
And why you want your all face inside my heart.
And I can see your face going nowhere
Honny I (I) don't (don't) want (want) to (to) be (be) close (close)
Cuz it's hard
And I don't know why you want me inside of your heart.
