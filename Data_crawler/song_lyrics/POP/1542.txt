Song Name: Coast (feat. Anderson .Paak)
Coast
You the wave upon my ocean
Pounding rhythm and motion
It's a full moon kinda night, yeah
I don't wanna go home yet
You can question my devotion
Wear my heart on my shoulder
Just relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know (yeah)
Feeling like I caught a wave with ya
I've been dealing with a lot of changes
And all the people that I like to hang with
They all been saying that I ain't the same
Listen, I been chilling with you for a couple days
If you ain't afraid, me and you should rage in the Sun rays
Come on out the cage, don't wanna tame, live it your way
Body go for days, got me in a daze, parties in L.A. feel like holidays
Hit the PCH and we on our way to a place I was born and raised
You live on the screen and the stage
I wanna fit in between your legs
Let's pick a day, everything can wait
Words can't relay, but it's givin' fate
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
'Cause nothing feels as real when we're connected
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
The stars come down, you drown 'em out
I'm sinking deeper into you
I breathe you in, I breathe you out
I'm sinking deeper into (hey)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows
We could cruise if the mood's right
Catch a wave in the moonlight
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
'Cause nothing feels as real when we're connected (coast)
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
