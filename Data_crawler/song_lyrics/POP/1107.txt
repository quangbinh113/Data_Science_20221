Song Name: For Those Who Can't Be Here
We put the lights up on the tree
And all the presents underneath
Light the fire, it's getting cold
Another year of, "Will it snow?"
Mixin' lager and champagne
Somethin' I'll never do again
'Round the table banter flows
Prayin' no one rocks the boat
Still, I know this picture's not quite right
There's someone on your mind
First Christmastime without him by your side, I know
The sound of Christmas bells
They never say farewell
So we laugh, we shed a tear
For those who can't be here
We're drinkin' sherry just because
Confessin' all our Christmas love
Watch Home Alone for the thousandth time
It's the only movie that we all like
But I know, this picture's not quite right
There's someone on my mind
First Christmastime without him by our side, I know
He loved these Christmas bells
'Cause they never say farewell
So we laugh, we shed a tear
For those who can't be here
For those who can't be here
For those who can't be here (the bells ring out for them)
For those who can't be here (the bells ring out for them)
For those who can't be here
The bells ring out for them
For those who can't be here
The bells ring out for them
For those who can't be here
