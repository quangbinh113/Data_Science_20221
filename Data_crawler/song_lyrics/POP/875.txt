Song Name: Ocean Blue
I don't usually cry at all
But wow, is it always close
Ranging from a movie scene
To made-up people in my dreams
The last time, if I recall
Was a feeling of being alone
I don't know if
Where I'm going isn't far, but
In case I go
No need to be stressed. Got a ticket home
Cause damn. I really miss the shade of blue
Just take it slow
I'll wait to find love
Better hear the call again
For now, I will feel the ocean view
And I pray that it won't be over soon
Oh my, I miss the sun
Just wait it won't be too long
Till' we arrive the coming day
Please ignore my restless face
Cause it's too hard to keep it all together
Ever since we left
I guess it just makes sense
To what the reasoning was
When I said
In case I go
No need to be stressed. Got a ticket home
Cause damn. I really miss the shade of blue
Just take it slow
I'll wait to find love
Better hear the call again
For now, I will feel the ocean view
And I pray that it won't be over soon
In case I go
No need to be stressed. Got a ticket home
Cause damn. I really miss the shade of blue
Just take it slow
I'll wait to find love
Better hear the call again
For now, I will feel the ocean view
And I pray that it won't be over soon
