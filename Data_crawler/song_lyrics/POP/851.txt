Song Name: Peace and Magic
Life is a fantasy
Bring your dreams to life
Someone will break open the door
I wanna let you know
There will be peace and magic in the middle of the night
The star look down
Kiss me crazy
We'll stay together
Oh stay together
I am not your prince anyway
But i've been thinking about the good time
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line, along the line
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line
Along the line
Life is full of troubles
Don't let it bother you
It is just one of those things
Hey baby, what do you want
Making a change in the right direction
Don't be afraid
Tell me baby
What can I get you?
Oh, can i get you?
Hold my hand and tell me baby
'Cause I can make it alright ever
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line, along the line
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line
Along the line
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line, along the line
To the stars
Don't break my heart
Stay by my side
Make up all night, all right
Somewhere along the line
Along the line
