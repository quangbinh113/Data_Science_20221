Song Name: Hopelessly Hopeless
I know I said
I'll be good, I'll be happy with somebody else
And you just sat there
You didn't fight back
If I could go back
I would beg you to stay, we would turn it around
'Cause if I'm honest
You're the best that I've had
I hope you will call and say something's missin'
Sayin' that the last few months been depressin'
Right now all that's left of us are the what-ifs
The, what if you were the one?
And what if I never get over the fact that we're over?
And what if we never get closure
Not even when we're gettin' older?
And what if we never sleep in the same bed together
And nobody kisses me better?
So I'm hopelessly hopin' forever
You've met another
You look happy with her, but are you happier?
Some days I wonder
If it's gonna last
'Cause I keep walkin' past the bar where you kissed me
Hopin' that you do the same when you miss me
Maybe there's a chance for us in the distance
'Cause, what if you were the one?
And what if I never get over the fact that we're over?
And what if we never get closure
Not even when we're gettin' older?
And what if we never sleep in the same bed together
And nobody kisses me better?
So I'm hopelessly hopin' forever
I think the two of us were a bit too young
If the timin' was different, things would be better
We'd not be hopelessly hopeless together
And I'm not hopelessly hopin' forever
We'd not be hopelessly hopeless together
'Cause, what if you were the one?
And what if I never get over the fact that we're over?
And what if we never get closure
Not even when we're gettin' older?
And what if we never sleep in the same bed together (together)
And nobody kisses me better?
So I'm hopelessly hopin' forever
