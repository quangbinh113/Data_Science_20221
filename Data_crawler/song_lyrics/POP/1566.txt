Song Name: (You Drive Me) Crazy
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin', what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you mean so much more
More than anythin' I ever felt before
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ooh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Ooh
Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one, you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anythin' I ever felt before
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ooh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ooh, crazy (you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night (oh)
You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby, yeah)
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
