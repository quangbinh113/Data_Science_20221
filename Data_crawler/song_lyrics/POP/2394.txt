Song Name: Unfinished Business
We almost made it
Next week would be three years
It was in my calendar but I unsaved it
You've seen me naked
Do you still think about it when you're in bed with her?
Was I your greatest?
My biggest mistake wasn't falling for you
It was thinking that maybe you fell for me too
And I overthink it cause that's what I do
But there was a world where it was me and you
We've got unfinished business, that I wish we could finish
'Cause in my mind, you're always mine
And all three of my wishes is that I could say "Good riddance"
'Cause God I've tried, but can't say goodbye
To all our unfinishеd business, ah, business, ah, business, ah, ah
All our unfinishеd business, ah, business, ah, business, ah, ah
How's your day been?
Never mind, I forgot I can't ask you that anymore
So I imagine that you're not happy (that you're not happy)
'Cause how could you be happy when our last conversation
Nearly killed me?
My biggest mistake wasn't falling for you
It was thinking that maybe you fell for me too
And I overthink it cause that's what I do
But there was a world where it was me and you
We've got unfinished business, that I wish we could finish
'Cause in my mind, you're always mine
And all three of my wishes is that I could say "Good riddance"
'Cause God I've tried, but can't say goodbye
To all our unfinished business, ah, business, ah, business, ah, ah
All our unfinished business, ah, business, ah, business, ah, ah
God damn, we got so close
It's the almost that hurts me the most
God damn, we got so close (damn, we got so close)
It's the almost that hurts me the most
We almost made it
Next week would be three years
It was in my calendar but I unsaved it
