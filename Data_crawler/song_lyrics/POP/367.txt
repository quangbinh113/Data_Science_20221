Song Name: Sex on the Beach
Come on and give me all your flavour
Something salty, something sweet
We be on our worst behaviour
'Cause we're young and wild and free
Only skin and sweat between us
You're like honey on a breeze
We mix so good together
Just like sex on the beach
Calling my line, party outside
Top of the hill, Hollywood sign
Sex on the beach, no stress, have a drink
I laugh on a boat, shake ass to the beat
Smile at the moon as we get lost
Lose my towel in the room, time to rinse off
Crowd by the pool, we been on ten
Hope this night don't end, yeah
Stranger hold hands, club, we slow dance
Strip in the room, might try to pole dance
Found my match, lost in the moment
The one-night stand feel like a romance
Jump off a yacht, hit the ocean
Get drunk and lost in the potion
You find your heart, leave it open
Deep like the sea, let that soak in
Come on and give me all your flavour
Something salty, something sweet
We be on our worst behaviour
'Cause we're young and wild and free
Only skin and sweat between us
You're like honey on a breeze
We mix so good together
Just like sex on the beach
Dance with the rose for my necklace
Camera pull out, I pose for a second
Yeah, life what you make it
Lie down, tell the truth while we naked
We go out 'til the sun come up
I'ma shoot my shot like a gun go bust
You on top, I'm 'bout to climax
Beat that up like a drummer hi-hat
IMAX movie filmed in my bed
Juicy, too sweet, you should try that
You need room key, you should slide back home
Music turned up like, this my song
Be a freak for you, have a drink or two
I can reach the peak when I think of you
Spend our life together, from a night together
Right now feel like forever
Come on and give me all your flavour
Something salty, something sweet
We be on our worst behaviour
'Cause we're young and wild and free
Only skin and sweat between us
You're like honey on a breeze
We mix so good together
Just like sex on the beach
What's it gonna take just to make you mine?
I don't wanna waste time being polite
Fuck me good, I'ma hit rewind
Fuck me twice, it's a hell of a night
What's it gonna take just to make you mine?
I don't wanna waste time being polite
Fuck me good, I'ma hit rewind
Fuck me twice, it's a hell of a night
Come on and give me all your flavour (give me all your flavour)
Something salty, something sweet
We be on our worst behaviour
'Cause we're young and wild and free
Only skin and sweat between us
You're like honey on a breeze
We mix so good together
Just like sex on the beach
Sex on the beach, mm-mm
Sex on the beach
