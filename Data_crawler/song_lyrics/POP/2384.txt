Song Name: Never Had a Chance
Why am I still here and waiting for us to happen?
'Cause you'd never want it
Everything I loved about you, I probably imagined
'Cause we never had it
Stupid of me to think that you could ever be mine
I could blame it on the drinks
But I'm so sick and tired of lying

And I wish I could think of you
And not have to still feel
Everything you probably
Don't, but I still think it's real

Why am I still here and waiting for us to happen
'Cause you'd never want it
Everything I loved about you, I probably imagined
'Cause we never had it
Funny it's been so long
And still there's nothing that's changed (changed)
And it was never your fault
Wish there was something to blame
And I wish I could think of you
And know that it was real
Hate that I'm still here and waiting for us to happen
It's not like you'd want it
Everything I loved about you, I know I imagined
'Cause we'd never had it
Imagined
'Bout you
Happen
Imagine
'Bout you
Happen
