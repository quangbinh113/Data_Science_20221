Song Name: Like It
In my bed
Got me dreaming here for days
Oh, it's like a drug
When you're near, I can't keep my hands away
I can't give you up
Something 'bout you
I don't know what it is
Something in you
Didn't know that I missed
When you're near, I can't keep myself away from you, from you
Darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Wide awake got no rest beneath the moon
Slowly, I inhale you
Drowning deep when I fall into your blue
There is no escape
Something 'bout you
I don't know what it is
Something in you
Didn't know that I missed
When you're near, I can't keep myself away from you, from you
Darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Hey, something 'bout you
I don't know what it is
Something in you
Didn't know that I missed
Don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
And don't, don't think about tomorrow
I, I hope you won't
One day all our love will fade and I know, yeah, I know
But darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Darling, don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
Hey, something 'bout you
I don't know what it is
Something in you
Didn't know that I missed
Don't you like it, like it too
Then tell me, tell me how it feel so good
