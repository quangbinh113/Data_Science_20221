Song Name: Toxic Pony
(ALTÉGO)
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
(If you're horny, let's do it)
And I love what you do (ride it)
Don't you know that you're toxic? (My pony)
(My saddle's waiting)
(Come and jump on it)
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
(If you're horny, let's do it)
And I love what you do (ride it)
Don't you know that you're toxic? (My pony)
(My saddle's waiting)
(Come and) don't you know that you're toxic? (Jump on it)
(Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride)
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
(If you're horny, let's do it)
And I love what you do (ride it)
Don't you know that you're toxic? (My pony)
With a taste of a poison paradise (my saddle's waiting)
I'm addicted to you (come and)
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Jump on it)
Intoxicate me now with your loving now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your loving now
I think I'm ready now (ALTÉGO)
