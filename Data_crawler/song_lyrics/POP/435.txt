Song Name: Me Too
Ow!
Who's that sexy thing I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thing hanging 'round my neck?
Um, that's gold, show me some respect, oh
I thank God every day (uh, ha)
That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
And I can't help loving myself
And I don't need nobody else, no, uh
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to V.I.P.
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do
I thank God every day (uh, ha)
That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
And I can't help lovin' myself (wooh!)
And I don't need nobody else, no, uh (baby)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (oh, ayy)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
Ow!
(Turn the bass up)
(Hahaha!)
Turn the bass up
Ow!
(Turn the bass up)
Let's go
I thank God every day (say to thank God)
That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
And I can't help loving myself (ow!)
And I don't need nobody else, no, uh, baby
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (oh)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
