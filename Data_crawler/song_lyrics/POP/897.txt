Song Name: Chaos Calls
Just wanna say that I love you

Like we used to
You make it hard for me to love you
Wanna love

Like we used to
You make it hard for me
(Sick of being sick of you
Back to where we belong)
Just wanna say that I love you
Chaos calls, then we fall
But I don't mind
Just wanna say that I hate you
(You make it hard for me to love you)
Just wanna say
Just wanna say that I love you
(You make it hard for me)
Chaos calls, then we fall
So let's rewind
Wanna love
Wanna love
But I hate you
But I don't mind
Chaos calls, then we fall
So let's
