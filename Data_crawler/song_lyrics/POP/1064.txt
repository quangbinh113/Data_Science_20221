Song Name: Fair
200 days and counting, I know
You're my favorite still
When I say I won't, tell myself I don't
But I always will feel the way I feel
You have time to heal, I got time to kill
Play in my mind like I rehearsed it
I know I should repurpose
Ain't no faking hurt like this, no
You carry her and all I carry are burdens
Time for me ain't working
I know heartbreak ain't perfect, but
Is it fair that you moved on?
'Cause I swear that I haven't
Is it right that you've grown
And I'm still stuck in habits?
'Cause I'm finding it strange
That you're better than average
Hearts didn't break down the middle
Tell me, how did that happen?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yeah, yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (better, better)

Maybe if we could trade places
So you'd feel betrayed and I can feel shameless
I carry all of the weight and you get all of the gains
I can't take all the ways that she may touch you
'Cause it plays in my mind like I rehearsed it
I know I should repurpose
Ain't no faking hurt like this, no
You carry her and all I carry are burdens
Time for me ain't working
I know heartbreak ain't perfect, but
Is it fair that you moved on? (Not fair)
'Cause I swear that I haven't (ooh)
Is it right that you've grown
And I'm still stuck in habits?
'Cause I'm finding it strange
That you're better than average
Hearts didn't break down the middle
Tell me, how did that happen?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yeah, yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (better, better)
