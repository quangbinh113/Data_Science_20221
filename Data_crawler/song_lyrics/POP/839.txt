Song Name: Lucky Girl
Are the walls getting closer
As I'm getting closer to you?
And are we falling faster?
Now we have further to fall
I know sometimes I act like
I don't care about you
I know, I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
And the thought of you leaving
Gets heavier every day
And my mind is deceiving
What is it that I'm believing?
I know sometimes I act like
I don't care about you
I know, I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
I know, I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky, lucky girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
