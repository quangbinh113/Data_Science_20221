Song Name: Goo Goo Muck
When the sun goes down, and the moon comes up
I turn into a teenage goo goo muck
Yeah, I cruise through the city and i roam the street
Looking for something that is nice to eat
You better duck
When I show up...
The goo goo muck.
I'm the night headhunter looking for some head
With a way out body underneath that head
Well I'll get you baby with a little luck
'Cuz i'm teenage tiger and a goo goo muck
You better duck
When I show up...
The goo goo muck
Yeah, the city is a jungle and I'm a beast
I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast
I want the most but i'll take the least
'Cuz i'm a goo goo muck tiger and a teenage beast, yeah...
You'd better duck, you motherfuck!
...The goo goo muck.
