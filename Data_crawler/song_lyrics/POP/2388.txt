Song Name: the older you get, the less you cry
I fell in love at 17
Had to make a choice, either her or my dreams
And I felt her love on the road
But that was a long time ago
I fell for the wrong girl, the type to start a fire
And leave you there to burn
And I found a way to stay alive
But somethin' in me that day died
How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barеly made it through yesterday
I wish I could lovе like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry
And I don't know what I gotta change
No matter what I do, it always ends the same
And I'm not givin' up yet
But I don't got a whole lot left
How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barely made it through yesterday
I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry
I wish I could love like I used to love (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
I wish I could love like when I was young (the less I cry)
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
The older you get, the less you cry (the less I cry)
I wish I didn't give all of me away (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say (the less I cry)
It's gettin' harder as the days go by (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
The older you get, the less you cry (the less I cry)
The older I get, the less that I cry (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
The less that I feel, I'm not gonna cry (the less I cry)
The older I get, the less that I cry (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
The less that I feel, I'm not gonna cry (the less I cry)
I wish I could love like I used to love (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
I wish I could love like when I was young (the less I cry)
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
The older you get, the less you cry (the less I cry)
