Song Name: Best Day Of My Life
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
(One, two, three, four)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm never gonna look back, woah
I never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright, the sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
