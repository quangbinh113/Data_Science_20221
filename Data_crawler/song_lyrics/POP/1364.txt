Song Name: Young Again
When I was a boy
I dreamed of a place in the sky
Playing in the fields
Battling with my shields
Bows made out of twine
I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
You wanna feel young
You wanna feel young again
When I was a boy
I searched for a world that's unknown
All we have is fun
Everybody runs
Until the sun goes down
I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
You wanna feel young
You wanna feel young again
