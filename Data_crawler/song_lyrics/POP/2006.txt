Song Name: Who Is She ?
Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?
Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery
Oh, who is she?
Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?
I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
Wherever she may be
Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?
Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal such as mine
Will come to me
Eternally
Immortal she
Return to me
