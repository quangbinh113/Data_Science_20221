Song Name: Showed Me (How I Fell In Love With You)
You showed me how to do exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room and people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
Oh-ohh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you
Everybody laughs at all the things you say
It makes me wanna cry whenever you're away
The way you drive a car with all the windows down
They always say your name, even when you're not around
Seasons only change (oh, oh, oh, ohh)
It's always been the same
You showed me how to do exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room and people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
Oh-ohh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you
I will be your fool, I come back every time
You always tell the truth, even when you lie
I watch you from afar, you show me what to do
And all the games you play, oh, I play all of them too
Seasons only change (oh, oh, oh, ohh)
It's always been the same
You showed me how to do exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room and people fall for you
How I wanna be like you (oh, ohh)
Oh-ohh, it's true

I'm gonna be like you
