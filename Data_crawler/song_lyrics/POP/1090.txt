Song Name: Can't Get Over You (feat. Aloe Blacc)
Can't get over you (can't get over you, can't get over you)
Can't get over you (can't get over you, can't get over you)
I can't recall that I've ever felt this way with no one at all
Yeah
Now that you're gone
Feel like I'm lost and I don't know how to move on
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind
It's killing me inside
That I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind, mind
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you
It hurts me to see
How you forgot about me so easily
Yeah, I feel the pain
It's building up inside of me and I can't escape
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind
It's killing me inside
That I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind, mind
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you
I need to feel it
I need to breath it
Just can't go without your love
I need to feel it
I need to breath it
To breath it
To breath it
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind
It's killing me inside
That I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind, mind
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you, you
Yeah, you, you
I can't get over you
