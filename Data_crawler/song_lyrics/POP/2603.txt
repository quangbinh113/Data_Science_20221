Song Name: Acapulco
Jason Derulo
I can't read ya
My sexy Mona Lisa
Can't tell if you gon' leave here
Or if you wanna stay
Girl, just ease up
Don't yell at my two-seater
You say that you a freak, girl
But fall asleep at eight
Sheesh
But you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama, mama
Sheesh
Girl, you killing me
But you won't see me
With another lover
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco
I'm just riding the wave
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Emotions like a yoyo
But I love you that way

Oh-oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover

Oh-oh
I love you that way
Damn, that body
Dabble in Versace
Did I win the lottery
Or am I gonna pay?
Damn, you got me
Like bitcoin and like Dolce
I'm rich with you beside me
'Cause you're not coin-based
Sheesh
But you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama, mama
Sheesh
Girl, you killing me
But you won't see me
With another lover
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco
I'm just riding the wave
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Emotions like a yoyo
But I love you that way, yeah
Sheesh
Girl, you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama
