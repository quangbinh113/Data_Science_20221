Song Name: When You're Gone
You never know how good you have it, oh-oh
Until you're starin' at a picture of the only girl that matters, ah-ah
I know what we're supposed to do
It's hard for me to let go of you
So I'm just tryna hold on
Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slipping through my fingertips
A little bit, by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on
I need to learn how to cope without you
I'm tryna protect myself, but only you know how to, yeah
Oh, I know what we're supposed to do
Oh, but I hate the thought of losing you
So I'm just tryna hold on
Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slipping through my fingertips
A little bit, by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on
Starting to feel like you don't need me
Wanna believe it's all for the better
It's gettin' real, I'm missing you deeply
So I'm just tryna hold on
Starting to feel like you don't need me
Wanna believe it's all for the better
It's gettin' real, I'm missing you deeply
So I'm just tryna hold on
Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slipping through my fingertips
A little bit, by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on
I'm just tryna hold on
