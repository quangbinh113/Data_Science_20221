Song Name: Cheapest Flight
Back against the wall
There goes the floor beneath my feet
A stack of empty crates
Giving out under me
I'll take one more sleepless night
Then book the cheapest flight
Buy my head some space to clear
There's no time to cut and run
I can't think 'bout what I've done
To get me here
Two miles off the ground
And no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean
Love can't bring me down
When I've taken myself
Way out of reach
Weakest move, but falls
But you know this hope is on the side
Tryna split the chain
To numbers that don't divide

I'll take one more sleepless night
And I'm on the cheapest flight
Give my head a chance to clear
There's no time to cut and run
I can't think 'bout what I've done
To get me here
Two miles off the ground
And no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean
Love can't bring me down
When I've taken myself
Way out of reach
Two miles off the ground
And no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean
Love can't bring me down
When I take myself
Way out of reach
Two miles off the ground
And no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean
Love can't bring me down
When I take myself
Way out of reach
