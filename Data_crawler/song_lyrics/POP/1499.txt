Song Name: Loser
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe, I must've been out of my mind
Now, I-I'm a loser
Why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine
'Cause I-I
I just might get a little too drunk
So, I won't think about us (uh)
I don't think about what (uh)
We could have been, and
I stay up, like, three or four nights
So I won't dream about us (uh)
I wake up with no luck (no)
I just can't win
I should've seen it all along (uh-uh)
She was a one in a million (uh-uh)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (someone says her name)
When we were goin' off and on (uh-uh)
I guess I really played it wrong (uh-uh)
I should've never let her slip away
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe, I must've been out of my mind
Now, I-I'm a loser
Why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine
'Cause I-I
Uh, I just might been a little too gone
When she needed somebody (uh)
Up against her body (whoa) at 2 a.m.
Yeah, now I keep lyin' to myself
But she's just joking probably (she's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again
I should've seen it all along (uh-uh)
She was a one in a million (uh-uh)
Now she's in love, and I'm in second place (damn)
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe, I must've been out of my mind (-ind)
Now, I-I'm a loser
Why'd I have to lose her? (Her)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine (be fine)
'Cause I-I, uh
I'm-ma-ma-ma-I
I'm-ma-ma-ma-I
I'm-ma-ma-ma, I'm a loser (yeah, I say)
I'm-ma-ma-ma-I
I'm-ma-ma-ma (I-I)
I'm-ma-ma-ma, I'm a loser
Tell me, God is real
Do you think about me still?
Or am I livin' for nothing?
Don't know where it went
Wrong, but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe, I must've been out of my mind
Now, I-I'm a loser (oh!)
Why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine (oh, baby, I)
'Cause I-I'm a loser
I'm-ma-ma-ma-I
I'm-ma-ma-ma-I
I'm-ma-ma-ma, I'm a loser (ah, hey, I say)
I'm-ma-ma-ma-ma (yeah, I say)
I'm-ma-ma-ma-ma (yeah, and I say)
I'm-ma-ma-ma, I'm a loser
