Song Name: Control
Early in the morning I still get a little bit nervous
Fighting my anxiety constantly I try to control it

Even when I know it's been forever I can still feel the spin
Hurts when I remember and I never wanna feel it again

Don't know if you get it 'cause I can't express how thankful I am
That you were always with me when it hurts, I know that you understand
I don't wanna lose control
Nothing I can do anymore
Trying every day when I hold my breath
Spinning out in space, pressing on my chest
I don't wanna lose control
Sometimes I still think it's coming but I know it's not

Trying to breathe in and then out but the air gets caught
'Cause even though I'm older now and I know how to shake off the past

I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have you holding my hand
I don't wanna lose control
Nothing I can do anymore
Trying every day when I hold my breath
Spinning out in space, pressing on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

I need you to know I would never be this strong without you
You've seen how I've grown, you took all my doubt
'Cause you were home
I don't wanna lose control
There's nothing I can do anymore
I don't wanna lose control (oh, oh, oh)
Nothing I can do anymore (anymore), anymore
Trying every day when I hold my breath
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest (pressing on my chest)
I don't wanna lose control
