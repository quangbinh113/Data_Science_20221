Song Name: Lonely Lovers
Sometimes, you can lose someone
And you won't ever feel the same no more
Wanna give up, it don't feel right
But you don't wanna feel this pain no more
Bad things come to those that don't deserve it
Why do I only pray when I'm hurtin'?
I might pour another glass
Wish I had one more chance to just have one more dance
A river full of tears, I'm swimmin' with the sharks
It's tearin' me apart, yeah
But we'll dance again in Heaven, my friend (Heaven, my friend)
It's been a while since I broke down in conversation
Little moments trigger memories when I talk about you
Hide the pain when only last year, it was always blatant
Acceptance comes eventually, man, 'cause what can you do?
Shut the world out, embrace the hurt
Nothin' can make it worse
So finish the bottle and open another, light up, inhale the burn
Everyone gets their turn
I still can't say the words, "I miss you"
It's livin' wrong, getting this fucked up to forget
But I don't wanna be livin' the day filled up with regret
With words I should've said
And nights that shouldn't of ended
The things I should've left
Any fights we should've mended
I heard time heals, I'm lookin' at my Rolex, that's a lie
The memories of the dead are keepin' me alive
And I'm a man so I have to act like I'm fine
But if I said it's easy, I'll be lyin'
If I could stop this feelin', oh
I wouldn't feel the need to be alone
But I see your face in others
Blue eyes, the sky above us
If I could admit when I'm feelin' scared
I wouldn't sit with all my demons here
We all feel the cold in summer
Our love as lonely lovers
In the light, in the glow, of a broken soul
In the light, in the glow, of a broken soul
The diamonds brazy, yeah, they're goin' berserk (yeah)
An empty soul and you need love, it's the worst (ooh)
I said it hurts a little more as your first
Gotta figure how you live and you learn (how you live and you learn)
I hit you up and I show you concern
I'm tryna paint a perfect picture with her (mm-mm)
I said it hurts a little more as your first
Gotta figure how you live and you learn (how you live and you learn)
Please keep on hearin' me out, I'm makin' sense
Got me starin' at some memories, now it's from the lense
Last October, but it's February now
We look alike, so it's gettin' me now
So we turn away
Now we gotta turn the page
I don't wanna hurt the same
I ain't gotta work the same
If I could stop this feelin', oh
I wouldn't feel the need to be alone
But I see your face in others
Blue eyes, the sky above us
If I could admit when I'm feelin' scared
I wouldn't sit with all my demons here
We all feel the cold in summer
Our love as lonely lovers
In the light, in the glow, of a broken soul
In the light, in the glow, of a broken soul
