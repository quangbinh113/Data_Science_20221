Song Name: Breakdown (feat. Demi Lovato)
I got big plans, but none of them feel like mine (yeah)
And I miss days where I used to feel like me (you know)
'Cause I've been trapped in all the freedom
Throw my heart up at the ceiling
I take another drink so I can kill the voice of reason
I got big plans, but none of them feel like mine (too much is too much)
You know
Uh, been fighting my demons, but they ain't fighting fair
But I keep saying, "Everything's alright, I swear"
All alone in a dark space, ain't no light in there
What's fucked up is I might actually like it there
Pouring everything on this paper my pen is on
Feel like I'm breaking in places they put the pressure on
I'm the one in my circle they all depending on
To do it though, I need these drugs I've become dependent on
Someone tried to confront me, now we don't get along
In my business, they tripping on what I'm sipping on
They can't reach the pedestal that my head is on
But, truthfully, I've been breaking down, just finally letting on
Oh, I'm in the middle of a breakdown, baby (uh, you know)
I need you, I need you (I got you)
Oh, I'm in the middle of a storm now, baby
I need you, I need you to come over (I got you)
Tell me this'll be over (uh)
Over soon now (yeah)
Oh, I'm in the middle of a breakdown, baby
I need you (I got you), I need you right
Uh, crowded space, but I feel alone
Eyes on me, all the time, in the judgement zone
Somewhere on the road, fucked up, but I'm missing home
No rest for the wicked, where could I put a pillow on
Anywhere, feel misunderstood, they try to patronize
They judging my ways, but won't empathize
You couldn't walk in my shoes, I'm not telling lies
Since 21, I've been running a whole enterprise
Provide for too many people, I can't jeopardize
But I've been breaking in half to two separate lives
Mr. Hyde just died looking into Jekyll's eyes
I start becoming somebody I can't recognize
Oh, I'm in the middle of a breakdown, baby (uh, you know)
I need you, I need you (I need you too)
Oh, I'm in the middle of a storm now, baby
I need you, I need you to come over (I got you)
Tell me this'll be over (uh)
Over soon now (yo)
Oh, I'm in the middle of a breakdown, baby
I need you (aye), I need you right
Oh, I, I need you (I got you)
Oh, I, I need you (I got you)
To come over, tell me this'll be over
Over soon now (yeah)
Oh, I'm in the middle of a breakdown, baby
I need you, I need you right (I got you)
I got big plans, but none of them feel like mine (you know)
And I miss days where I used to feel like me
