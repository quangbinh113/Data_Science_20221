Song Name: Older (feat. Sierra Deaton)
I don't wanna get older
Without your head on my shoulder
On the day that you leave me
I'll forever be bleeding, love
As forever comes closer
Hope the world will spin slower
I don't wanna get older
I don't wanna get older
Stare at the photograph
Suddenly takes me back
The promises roll off your breath
In your cocaine-colored wedding dress
Lost in the day to day
You kiss away the pain
Oh, every time you twist my lips
My dear devoted delicate
It's not worth it if I lose my one-way ticket for two
Just me
Just you
I don't wanna get older
Without your head on my shoulder
On the day that you leave me
I'll forever be bleeding love
As forever comes closer
Hope the world will spin slower
I don't wanna get older
I don't wanna get older
Our love is tailor-made
But we let the edges fray
Your wicked smile, it says it all
Mixed with my sad and cynical
No tragedy at the end
No nothing Shakespearean
It all comes flooding back again
My dear devoted delicate
It's not worth it if I lose my one-way ticket for two
Just me
Just you
I don't wanna get older
Without your head on my shoulder
On the day that you leave me
I'll forever be bleeding love
As forever comes closer
Hope the world will spin slower
I don't wanna get older
I don't wanna get older
