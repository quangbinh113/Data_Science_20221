Song Name: Friends Again
Friends again
Friends again
Thank goodness we've come back around
I'm happy that we are
Friends Again
I can't remember what went wrong
And I don't care
I'm sorry for my share
Friends again
Friends again
Thank goodness we've come back around
I'm happy that we're
Friends again
I'll meet you anywhere are you
We've got a lot
Of catching up to do
Friends again
Friends again
Thank goodness we've come back around
We've got our feet back on the ground
Something missing has been found
I'm happy that we're
Friends again
Friends again
Friends again
