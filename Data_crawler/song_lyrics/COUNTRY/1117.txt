Song Name: Last Call
Oh lord won't you please just let this honky tonk stay open
Cause I have no place to go come closing time
And all my friends are here and I just need to keep on soaking
All the deep and dark recesses of my mind
And I'd rather be here than anywhere that I can think of
And I'm probably gonna be here until they throw me out
Cause last call don't mean not one damn thing to me
It's just another cue for me to go get my next round
Oh lord won't you please make sure that jukebox don't quit playing
And make sure that keg ain't floating in the back
Cause I still got room for one more and my dancing shoes are on
And I got a few more hours before I got to hit the sack
And I'd rather be here than anywhere that I can think of
And I'm probably gonna be here until they throw me out
Cause the last call don't mean not one damn thing to me
It's just another cue for me to go get my next round
And I'd rather be here than anywhere that I can think of
And I'm probably gonna be here until they throw me out
Cause last call don't mean not one damn thing to me
Well it's just another cue for me to go get my next round
Well it's just another cue for me to go get my next round
Well it's just another cue for me to go get my next round
