Song Name: Heartbreak Away
Sometimes you get it right on the first try
Everything lines up like it should
Sometimes you're on the wrong side of a goodbye
Tell yourself, "I won't do that again"
But sometimes forever's a heartbreak away
Think love just won't happen, but there'll come a day
Where your perfect fit walks through the door
The way you feel now, you won't feel no more
Sparks start to flame, won't ever be the same
'Cause sometimes forever, forever's a heartbreak away
The hurtin' ain't easy, but believe me
All that leaving is gonna leave you one day
It don't make sense right now, but it's gonna work out
All that let down will be worth the pain
But sometimes forever's a heartbreak away
Think love just won't happen, but there'll come a day
Where your perfect fit walks through the door
The way you feel now, you won't feel no more
Sparks start to flame, won't ever be the same
'Cause sometimes forever, forever's a heartbreak away
'Cause sometimes forever's a heartbreak away
Think love just won't happen, but there'll come a day
Where your perfect fit walks through the door
The way you feel now, you won't feel no more
Sparks start to flame, won't ever be the same
'Cause sometimes forever, forever's a heartbreak away
