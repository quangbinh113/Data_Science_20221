Song Name: Blue Sky
Walk along the river, sweet lullaby
They just keep on flowin'
They don't worry 'bout where it's goin'
No, no
Don't fly, mister bluebird
I'm just walkin' down the road
Early morning sunshine
Tell me all I need to know
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah
Good old Sunday mornin'
Bells are ringin' everywhere
Goin' to Carolina
It won't be long and I'll be there
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah, yeah
