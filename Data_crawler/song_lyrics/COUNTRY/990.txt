Song Name: Find Me Here - Broke Down
I'm tangled up in hotel sheets
Three sheets to the wind
I'm kicking myself
Staring at this cross on my skin
Too jacked up to just black out
In this mess of a bed I made
With some girl I'll just call Omaha
'Cause I'll forget her name
And there's a preacher on a TV
Saying something 'bout You coming back soon
And got me thinking 'bout how
If You walked in now
What the hell I'd do
I wish I was on a plane or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Really, I don't wanna be
Caught in room 316
With a hotel Bible as a coaster underneath my beer
And Lord if you decide tonight's the night
You're coming back
I hope you don't find me here
If I get down on my knees
And it ain't too much to ask
Could You break the chains that hold me down
And get the devil off my back?
And if You go and split that eastern sky
I pray You take your time
Yeah, I promise You
I'll make these old boots walk a straight line
I wish I was on a plane or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Really, I don't wanna be
Caught in room 316
With a hotel Bible as a coaster underneath my beer
And Lord if You decide tonight's the night
You're coming back
I hope You don't find me here
There's a preacher on a TV
Saying something 'bout You coming back soon
I ain't got a doubt, if You walked in now
Man, I'd be screwed
I wish I was on a plane or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Really, I don't wanna be
Caught in room 316
With a hotel Bible as a coaster underneath my beer
And Lord if You decide tonight's the night
You're coming back
I hope You don't find me here
I hope You don't find me here
I'm tangled up in hotel sheets
Three sheets to the wind
I'm kicking myself
Staring at this cross on my skin
