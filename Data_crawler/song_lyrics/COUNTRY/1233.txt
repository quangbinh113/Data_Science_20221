Song Name: Giving You Up - Acoustic
Don't you dare try and reappear after you already got me standing here
I can't believe you would come at me looking for a little bit of sympathy
Like I wasn't the one you left all alone crying looking like a hot mess
Don't show your face 'round here anymore, honey
This is something you better get through your head
'Cause I'm giving you up
Just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I'm giving you up
Same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it's all so tough
You turn me into a man I don't even recognize
I'm giving you up
Same way you did me out in the moonlight
What the hell are you thinking coming 'round to visit
Completely uninvited, messing with my brain again
Couldn't give me the satisfaction of forgetting your existence
Showed up when I thought I finally found the end
Don't be coming over looking for a conversation
Dropping little hints that you want me back again
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of them little lies you tell me
So here is all I'm saying, baby, better listen in
I'm giving you up
Just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I'm giving you up
The same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it's all so tough
You turn me into a man I don't even recognize
I'm giving you up
The same way you did me out in the moonlight, oh
Out in the moonlight
So I'm letting go of all the things that held their grips on me
With you being my first priority
'Cause death isn't worth the weight of your love no more
And I'm packing up, leaving, closing shop
There ain't no use for you in this heart no more
So I'm letting go
Yeah, I'm giving you up
Just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I'm giving you up
The same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it's all so tough
You turn me into a man I don't even recognize
I'm giving you up
The same way you did me out in the moonlight, oh
Yeah, I'm giving you, I'm giving you, I'm giving you up
Oh, I'm giving you, I'm giving you, giving you up
