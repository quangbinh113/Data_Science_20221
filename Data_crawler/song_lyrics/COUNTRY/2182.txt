Song Name: To Hank (feat. HARDY, Brantley Gilbert & Colt Ford)
To Hank
Well, there's a lotta old boys like me
That grew up in a country state of mind
Knew every word, knew every line you sang
We'd crank you up on a Friday night
We'd ride them roads and just let you play
I just wanna say, yeah
Thanks for the whiskey bents and hell bounds
And all those nights just ridin' around
To the soundtrack of my life
Man, we had us some nights
Between outlaw women and my rowdy friends
Every song you sang, it just seemed to fit
Like a Chevy on a river bank
No tellin' how many beers I drank
To Hank, yeah
Hey, how 'bout you, B.G.?
Aw, yeah
First time I saw you playing
Well, you were drunk and I was too
You forgot the words, but I helped you out
Sang along with the whole damn crowd
To Hank
Yeah, I know you rolled a little smoke
And ticked off some folks as I recall
But ain't we all? Yeah, ain't we all?
Thanks for the whiskey bents and hell bounds
And all those nights just ridin' around
To the soundtrack of my life
Man, we had us some nights
Between outlaw women and my rowdy friends
Every song you sang, it just seemed to fit
Like a Chevy on a river bank
No tellin' how many beers I drank
To Hank
You know, he ain't the only Hank (nah, he sure ain't)
Let me tell ya, Hoss, long before ol' Bocephus (well, come on)
There was, "Hey Good Lookin'", and, "I Saw the Light"
And, "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Yeah, he left us way too soon
Can't nobody fill his shoes
Between, "Cold, Cold Heart", and, "Mansion On the Hill"
Every song he sang just seemed to feel
Like a Caddy on a lost highway
So many things I'd like to say
To Hank
