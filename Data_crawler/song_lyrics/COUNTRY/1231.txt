Song Name: 5 Foot 9 - Acoustic
(Whoa-oh)
Jack makes good whiskey, yeah
Red dirt makes good riding roads
Country makes good music
For kickin' up dust in a taillight glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Good years make good swings
And all that's all good but for me
God makes
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, God makes the good stuff
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes
God makes
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
God made her so I'ma make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me
When He made
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
(Whoa-oh)
Yeah, God makes the good stuff
Yeah, God makes the good stuff (whoa-oh)
Whoa, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
