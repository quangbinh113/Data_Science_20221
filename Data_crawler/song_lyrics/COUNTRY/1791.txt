Song Name: Crash and Burn
So, I guess it's over baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinnin'
And if I turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one
That's in the shoes that I am
Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwin' it away
I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
If others don't sing sad songs
Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
That's right
Another lover
Another lover crash and burn
Oh yeah
Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn
