Song Name: Took the Fall
Used to be my favorite time of the year
Don't get better than football and beer
That so proud home crowd gets loud around here
Was music to my ears
But this season it don't feel the same
The first one since we put out the flame
I didn't know how much I would care
'Til l saw her there
I know that I shouldn't be mad
She don't even know what she has
She got them gameday seats, section 223
She got that first down touchdown kiss on her cheek
Every Saturday tailgate friend that I can't call
Yeah, she got 'em all
Now every time goes red, all the leaves start to change
I remember September and wish I could say that
I don't hate her 'cause I know it ain't her fault
Oh, but she took the fall
She can take those late night fights
Keep the smell of his Marlboro Lites
His 99 jersey of that kicker I don't like
I really don't mind
Some weekends I don't even watch
'Cause even when we win, I still lost
She got them gameday seats, section 223
She got that first down touchdown kiss on her cheek
Every Saturday tailgate friend that I can't call
Yeah, she got 'em all
Now every time goes red, all the leaves start to change
I remember September and wish I could say that
I don't hate her 'cause I know it ain't her fault
Oh, but she took the fall
I know that I shouldn't be mad
I just wish that she knew what she had
She got them gameday seats, section 223
She got that first down touchdown kiss on her cheek
Every Saturday tailgate friend that I can't call
Yeah, she got 'em all
Now every time goes red, all the leaves start to change
I remember September and wish I could say that
I don't hate her 'cause I know it ain't her fault
No, I can't hate her 'cause I'm the one who dropped the ball
Oh, and she took the fall
She took the fall
