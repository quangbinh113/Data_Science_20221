Song Name: Your Heart Or Mine
All it takes is a downtown bar
All it takes is some neon stars
A little you, a little me in the same vicinity and it's on
Every one is the first last time
Walk away then we hit rewind
A little touch, a little buzz, don't know what keeps keepin' it up
Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time 'til it finds
Your heart or mine
We say that it ain't no thing
We say it, then the telephone rings
A hello, are you at home, 'cause I'm all alone missin' you
We swear it ain't love, love, love
But you're there when the sun comes up
We swear it ain't love, love, love
But it always comes back to us
Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time till it finds
Your heart or mine
We swear it ain't love, love, love
We swear it ain't love, love, love
Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time 'til it finds
Your heart or mine
Your heart or mine
