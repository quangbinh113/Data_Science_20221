Song Name: Circles Around This Town
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tenneesse
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank god I was an optimist
I drove circles around this town
Tryin' to write circles around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
So many times, I thought about leavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Everybody else is ones who got away
I'm around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote
Drivin' circles around this town
Tryin' to write circles around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
Drivin' circles around this town
Hey!
I drove circles around this town
Tryin' to write circles around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
I still get lost, I still get found
Drivin' circles around this town
Oh yeah
