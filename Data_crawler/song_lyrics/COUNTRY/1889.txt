Song Name: Wait Outside
Hey, pretty angel
Flipped a switch and turn off the sun
You are a star so you know where they are
And baby, when the night is done
And the mornin' comes, we'll start over again
So good, it's gotta be a sin
I will love you forever
Until the day that I die
I would love you in heaven
But I'll just have to wait outside
And tell me when was it a good idea
To try and save a mess like me?
All I wanna do beyond the blue
Is spend my eternity with you next to me
But until then, if they don't let me in
I will love you forever
Until the day that I die
I would love you in heaven
I'll just have to wait outside
Yeah, I'll love you forever
Just like I love you tonight
I would love you in heaven
I'll just have to wait outside
If you got any pull with the man upstairs
Baby, when we get up there
Tell Him that I finally did something right
Maybe you'll change His mind
I will love you forever
Until the day that I die
I would love you in heaven
I'll just have to wait outside
Yeah, love you forever
Just like I love you tonight
I would love you in heaven
But I'll just have to wait outside
I would love you in heaven
I'll just have to wait outside
