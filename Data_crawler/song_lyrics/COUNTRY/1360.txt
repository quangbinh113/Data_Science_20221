Song Name: Making Up My Mind
Last night was something like a good dream
But I woke up and you're right next to me
Sorta feeling like country boy heaven
Or like Vegas when you're rolling sevens
I got things I gotta do today
But your lips got me leaning the other way
You're lookin' like an angel in the mornin' light
With your halo hair and your kiss me eyes
Ain't no way that I could say no
When you're whisperin', baby, baby don't go
'Tween layin' right here and lovin' on you
Slippin' out the sheets, slippin' on my boots
I don't even have to think twice
You're pretty good at makin' up my mind
Sure know how to get into my head
And make me not wanna get out of this bed
You really know how to get my heart racin'
And how to keep me stayin'
With you lookin' like an angel in the mornin' light
With your halo hair and your kiss me eyes
Ain't no way that I could say no
When you're whisperin', baby, baby don't go
'Tween layin' right here and lovin' on you
Slippin' out the sheets, slippin' on my boots
I don't even have to think twice
You're pretty good at makin' up my mind
And messin' up my plans
And takin' up my time
And pullin' me in close
And makin' up my mind
Lookin' like an angel in the mornin' light
With your halo hair and your kiss me eyes
Ain't no way that I could say no
When you're whisperin', baby, baby don't go
'Tween layin' right here and lovin' on you
Slippin' out the sheets, slippin' on my boots
I don't even have to think twice
You're pretty good at makin' up my mind
Makin' up my mind
Yeah, you're pretty good at makin' up my mind
