Song Name: It Ain't My Fault
Blame the whiskey on the beer
Blame the beer on the whiskey
Blame the mornin' on the night
For whose lyin' here with me
Blame the bar for the band
Blame the band for the song
Blame the song for the party that went all night long
But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault
Blame the heart for the hurtin'
Blame the hurtin' on the heart
Blame the dark on the devil
Blame the devil on the dark
Blame the ex for the drinkin'
Blame the drinkin' for the ex
Blame the two for one tequila's for whatever happens next
But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault
I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain't my fault
Blame my reason on my name
Blame my name on my reason
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn't take a joke
But it ain't my fault
I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
