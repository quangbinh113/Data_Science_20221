Song Name: I'm No Stranger to the Rain
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
I've fought with the Devil
Got down on his level
But I never gave in
So he gave up on me
I'm no stranger to the rain
I can spot bad weather
And I'm good at finding shelter
In a downpour
I've been sacrificed by brothers
Crucified by lovers
But through it all
I withstood the pain
I'm no stranger to the rain
But when I get that foggy feeling
When I'm feeling down
If I don't keep my head up
I may drown
But it's hard to keep believing
I'll even come out even
While the rain beats your hope in the ground
And tonight it's really coming down
I'm no stranger to the rain
But there'll always be tomorrow
And I'll beg, steal, or borrow a little sunshine
And I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
To ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain
Oh, no, I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
But I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
To ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain
Oh, no, I'm no stranger to the rain
