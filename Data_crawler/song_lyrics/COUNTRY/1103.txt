Song Name: Sober & Skinny
Oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh
I empty the fridge
You empty the bottle
We're stacking up a mountain of hard pills
We'll have to swallow
It's strange how we point
I've lost it one another
We both got different vices
And they lead us to each other
Cause you owe the drink and I over eat
We're under thinking everything
And every night we swear it's gonna change
But in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Write the checks that we can cash
Keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (hmm-mmm)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (yeah, mmm)
You want being a shrink
While I think we should talk to one
Find a comfy couch and let out all the hurt
We've kept inside since we were young
That's so numb
Now we found ways to cover up
If we keep going out
We're going while we become
Cause in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Writing checks that we can cash
An keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh, oh
It's easy to imagine, imagine
All our problems disappear like magic, magic
But even on this world
You're not sober, I'm not skinny
We scraping by old borrowed pennies
Writing checks that'll never cash
Breaking all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
Maybe we'll grow old together
Waking up by our happy ending
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh, oh)
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
You'll get sober, I'll get skinny
It's easy to imagine
It's easy to imagine
