Song Name: Cattle Call
Whoo-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Whoo-ooh-ooh-oop-doo-doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yod-el-od-el-lo-ti-de
The cattle are prowlin', the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin', a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call
Whoo-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Whoo-ooh-ooh-oop-doo-doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yod-el-od-el-lo-ti-de
He rides in the sun 'til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Singin' his cattle call
For hours, he would ride on the range far and wide
When the night winds blow up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
Whoo-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Whoo-ooh-ooh-oop-doo-doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yod-el-od-el-lo-ti-de
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an ol' western drawl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Singing his cattle call
Ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-di-di
Whoo-ooh-ooh-oop-doo-doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yod-el-od-el-lo-ti-de
