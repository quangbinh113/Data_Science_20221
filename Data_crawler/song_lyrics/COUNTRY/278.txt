Song Name: When She Says Baby
Some days it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Some days I'd rather be a no show lie low
'Fore I go outta my mind
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
Some nights I come home fightin' mad
Feel like runnin' my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fightin' for any more feelin' torn
Ah, to hell with it all
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
When she says baby
Everything's gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life
Yeah, she's the perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethin' I could believe in a best friend
And heaven sent a love to lean on
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
