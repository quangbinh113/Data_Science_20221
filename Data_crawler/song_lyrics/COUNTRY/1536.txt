Song Name: Blue Yodel Number 8
Good mornin' Captain good mornin' shine
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new mud line
I like to work I'm rolling all the time
I can carve my initials
On a mule's behind
Hey, little water boy bring that water round
If you don't like your job
Set that water bucket down
Working on the good roads dollar and half a day
My good gal's waiting on Saturday night
Just to draw my pay
I'm going to town honey what you want me to bring you back
Bring a pint of booze
And a John B Stetson hat
I smell your bread a burning turn your damper down
If you ain't got a damper
Good gal, turn your bread around
