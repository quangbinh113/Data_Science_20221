Song Name: Heart Shut (feat. Tenille Townes)
I'm sitting here in a neon cloud
You walk in and there ain't no doubt
You look happy now
Damn, you look happy now
He takes your coat and gets your chair
You're talking fast, you cut your hair
You still drink Coke and crown
Yeah, you look happy now
I wish I could walk over, say, "Hello, how you been?"
Pretend that this ain't killing me, pretend we're just old friends
I wish I could just lie to you, keep my feelings all locked up
But when it comes to you, I know I'll say too much
'Cause it's hard to keep my heart shut
It's hard to keep my heart shut
There's a gravity that's in this room
Why do I feel so pulled to you
When I'm right here with him?
Damn, I looked at you again
I took some space, I gave it time
For the smoke to clear, for the fire to die
But the flame's still flickering
And I'm right here with him
I wish I could walk over, say, "Hello, how you been?"
Pretend that this ain't killing me, pretend we're just old friends
I wish I could just lie to you, keep my feelings all locked up
But when it comes to you, I know I'll say too much
'Cause it's hard to keep my heart shut
I wonder if you feel the way I do
Is it better if we never know the truth?
I wish I could walk over, say, "Hello, how you been?"
Pretend that this ain't killing me, pretend we're just old friends
I wish I could just lie to you, keep my feelings all locked up
But when it comes to you, I know I'll say too much
'Cause it's hard to keep my heart shut
It's hard to keep my heart shut
I can't keep my heart shut, oh
I can't keep my heart shut
I can't keep my heart shut
