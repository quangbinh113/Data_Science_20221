Song Name: Small Town Crazy
Hey baby, won't you climb on up
And let me show you what's past that pavement?
Right there's where I crashed my first truck
And this field is old man Whalen's
Catch a good vibe, feeling all right
Solo cup, circled up in the summertime
Got some good friends
Take it all in
It's gonna be the time of your life
We're all out here
Tearing it up on a Saturday night
We're all out here
Raising 'em up under the moonlit spotlight
Back 40, call the DFE
Iced out bullets and a shotgun seat
You might think that we're trouble, baby
We're just small town crazy
Write it down, scratch it off your wishlist
Cash it in like a one-way ticket
What you need?
Can't you see?
Everything that you've been missing
We're all out here
Tearing it up on a Saturday night
We're all out here
Raising 'em up under the moonlit spotlight
Back 40, call the DFE
Iced out bullets and a shotgun seat
You might think that we're trouble, baby
We're just small town crazy
We're all out here
We're all out here
Oh, come on (let's go)
We're all out here
Tearing it up on a Saturday night
We're all out here
Raising 'em up under the moonlit spotlight
Back 40, call the DFE
Iced out bullets and a shotgun seat
You might think that we're trouble, baby
We're just small town crazy
Oh, yeah
(Write it down, scratch it off your wishlist)
We're just small town crazy
