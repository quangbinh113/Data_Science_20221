Song Name: Everything She Ainâ€™t
She ain't a peach you oughta be picking
She ain't the cup of tea you oughta be sipping
She treats you like you're broke, like you need fixing
You ain't getting nothing back for all that you're giving
And if you're good with who you're kissing, c'est la vie
But I can show you what you're missing, yeah boy, I can be
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't
She sees diamonds but I'm seeing stars
You should leave her on an island, dance with me in this bar
Honey, there's plenty of fish in the sea
But if you take a second look, you'll see there's only one of me
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't
She's all wrong for you
Just the girl-next-door you know is right as rain
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't
Yeah, I'm everything she is and everything she ain't
