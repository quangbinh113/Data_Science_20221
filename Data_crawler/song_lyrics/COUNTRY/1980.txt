Song Name: Greener Pasture
I'm sittin' on the front porch, cigarette burnin'
The Maker's in my coffee, sure ain't workin'
I see the dirt from where his boots used to lay
Still phantom pains after a couple of days
Now I wonder if he ever thought about turnin' around
Bet he's past El Paso by now
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I shoulda known I ain't his last Rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
Matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greenеr pasture
Bet he's rollin' through a nеw town and she's fallin' for his accent
She don't know that he's a dust cloud, he's beautifully tragic
He stays for the night but he's gone by the mornin'
Let him move in your life like a Tennessee storm
And this shouldn't tear you up, break you down this bad
Lovin' somethin' you never had
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I shoulda known, I ain't his last Rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
And all that ever mattered, livin' hard and livin' faster
Freedom was a dagger to a knife holder
There ain't no ever after, you're special, then you're shattered
Damn, he's got a way of leavin' his mark
Yeah, I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I shoulda known I ain't his last Rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
