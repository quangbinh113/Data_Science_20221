Song Name: All It Cost Me Was Everything
I been high, I been low
I been wound up tighter than a hangman's rope
I broke hearts, I been burned
Taught a lot of lessons but I never learned
I been good, I been bad
Been the best worst friend that you ever had
I been right, I been wrong
I'm a walkin' talkin' livin' breathin' country song
Money can't buy more than it can
When you ain't got nothin' but somethin' to prove
The price is high for not givin' a damn
But when you don't, you ain't got nothin' to lose
It ain't hard to be a fool like me
All it cost me was everything
I get loose, I get loud
I give a lotta people shit to talk about
I get mad, I get mean
But I'm a fire tongued dеvil with a belly full of gasoline
Money can't buy morе than it can
When you ain't got nothin' but somethin' to prove
The price is high for not givin' a damn
But when you don't, you ain't got nothin' to lose
It ain't hard to be a fool like me
All it cost me was everything
Everything
Money can't buy morе than it can
When you ain't got nothin' but somethin' to prove
The price is high for not givin' a damn
But when you don't, you ain't got nothin' to lose
It ain't hard to be a fool like me
No, it ain't hard to be a fool like me
All it cost me was everything
Cost me everything
