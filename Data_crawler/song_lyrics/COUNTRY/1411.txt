Song Name: Burnin Out (with Kidd G)
She stormed out the front door like a bat right out of hell
It looks like her and I are done this time as far as I can tell
She told her momma that we're over
I really went out and done things this time
I bare the weight all on my shoulders
I took the blame and I swallowed my pride
If this is how, this is how it's gonna be
Let me tell 'em, let me tell 'em what she's done to me
She made my heart turn black now I can't go back to what I used to be
She made me hate this town
When I drive around I see her and me
She said forever, and then she walked out
She took my blue skies turned 'em into dust clouds
Built it all up, to tear it all down
We were burnin' wild, now we're burnin' out
Heard she found somebody new and she moved on just like that
After everything we been through
How'd she forget me so fast
Yeah, I've been on the bottle more
Waking up with bloodshot eyes
I really hope the grass is greener on the other side
If this is how, this is how it's gonna be
Let me tell 'em, let me tell 'em what she's done to me
She made my heart turn black now I can't go back to what I used to be
She made me hate this town
When I drive around I see her and me
She said forever, and then she walked out
She took my blue skies turned 'em into dust clouds
Built it all up, to tear it all down
We were burnin' wild, now we're burnin' out
Burnin', burnin' out
Burnin', burnin' out
Burnin', burnin' out
Burnin', burnin' out
Yeah, we're burnin' out
She made my heart turn black now I can't go back to what I used to be
She made me hate this town
When I drive around I see her and me
She said forever, and then she walked out
She took my blue skies turned 'em into dust clouds
Built it all up, to tear it all down
We were burnin' wild, now we're burnin' out
Now we're burnin' out
