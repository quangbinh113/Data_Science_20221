Song Name: Hell Bent on Hard Times
There goes the devils on my back
Sleepin' with one eye open
One step shy of a soul attack
Awake, but I ain't woken
Ridin' the rail of a one-way track
Nowhere am I goin'
And there ain't no lookin' back
Where the white line fades to black
I'm hell bent on hard times
To the bottom of the bottle i
In a straight line
No Heaven, not my kind
No reason not to turn around
Guess I'll keep runnin' blind
'Cause I'm hell bent on hard times
I won't ducktail, I'll blaze a trail
I'm broke, but I ain't broken
I'm a fuse that's lit, I'm a son of a bitch
A sinner and I own it
My eyes are closed, my gypsy soul
Will forever keep on goin'
And I'll play this lonesome sound
'Til they lay me in the ground
I'm hell bent on hard times
To the bottom of the bottle
In a straight line
No Heaven, not my kind
No reason not to turn around
Guess I'll keep runnin' blind
'Cause I'm hell bent on hard times, yeah
Yeah, I'm hell bent on hard times
To the bottom of the bottle
In a straight line
No Heaven, not my kind
No reason not to turn around
I guess I'll keep runnin' blind
I'm hell bent on hard times
I'm hell bent on hard times
You can wallow in despair and say a prayer and curse the sky
Drive yourself mad and sit around
Sad and wonder why
Beat yourself up from the lack
Of love like a beatin' from
Your old man's belt
Or you can be a man
And not give a damn,
Just play the hands you're dealt
