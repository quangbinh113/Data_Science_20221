Song Name: Blame It on Your Heart
You've got a thing or two to learn about me, baby
'Cause I ain't taking it no more and I don't mean maybe
You don't know right from wrong
Well, the love we had is gone
So blame it on your lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin, two timing, double dealing
Mean, mistreatin, lovin' heart
Well, all I wanted was to be your one and only
And all I ever got from you was bein' lonely
Now that dream is laid to rest
'Cause you have failed the test
So blame it on your lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin', two timin', double dealin'
Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
Are you heading for a heartache (oh, yeah)
Gonna get a bad break (oh, yeah)
You made a bad mistake (oh, yeah)
Well, your never gonna find another love like mine
Someone's gonna do you like you've done me, honey
And when she does you like she'll do you, it ain't funny
You'll need some sympathy
But don't be calling me
Hey, blame it on your lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin', two timin', double dealin'
Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
Are you heading for a heartache (oh, yeah)
Gonna get a bad break (oh, yeah)
You made a bad mistake (oh, yeah)
Well, your never gonna find another love like mine
Someone's gonna you do you like you've done me, honey
And when she does you like she'll do you, it ain't funny
You'll need some sympathy
But don't be calling me
Hey, blame it on your lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin', two timin', double dealin'
Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
Yeah, blame it on your lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin', two timin', double dealin'
Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
