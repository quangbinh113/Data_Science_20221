Song Name: Cowboy Killer
Turns every hat when she walks through that door
Ain't never seen a cowgirl like her before
She got lips like a rattlesnake venom
She don't miss in that Wrangler denim
Break your heart then make you bag for more
She's a cowboy killer
She's a cowboy killer
She'll light you up like a loaded gun
Cloud of smoke, no filter
She's a cowboy killer
(Cowboy killer)
(Cowboy killer)
If you think your truck and buckle gon' get it done
Let me tell you, brother, she ain't the one
She's wild and free like those wide open spaces
Mean as old Bodacious
She's a cowboy killer
She's a cowboy killer
She'll light you up like a loaded gun
Cloud of smoke, no filter
She's a cowboy killer
Look (ay)
She that beautiful face, wanted all over (ay)
Put the smoke wagons on ya and then she'll ghost ya (bye, bye, partner)
A pistol partner straight out the holster
A cowboy killer, here comes the vultures
Kill more outlaws than Billy the Kid
A real bandit, darlin', now that's True Grit
A gypsy dolly, gotta watch her tricks
You better pray to the Lord that she lets you live
She's on every wanted poster in this town, town, town
If you're on a high, high horse, she'll shoot you down
She's a cowboy killer (she a cowboy killer)
She's a cowboy killer (she a cowboy killer)
She'll light you up like a loaded gun
Cloud of smoke, no filter
She's a cowboy killer
(Cowboy killer)
