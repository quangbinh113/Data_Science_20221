Song Name: Keep Her Breathing
Papa was a part of the greatest generation
A lot of blood shed
Just for the right to say it
Now he sees her heart being ripped to pieces
It's gonna take us all to keep it beating
I'm proud of a true American tradition
Patriotic to the core is how I'm livin'
They can't take your pride if you don't give it
I'll fight til my last breath
To keep Her breathing
Her story is still a long and winding road
Blood was paid for the debt
That she was owed
And those that gave it all we will remember
Just like that fateful
Seventh of December
I'm proud of a true American tradition
Patriotic to the core is how I'm livin'
They can't take your pride if you don't give it
I'll fight til my last breath
To keep Her breathing
Now years later with the same old story
Fighting to survive not for glory
We bury fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters
Just remember your freedom
Is what it's all for
I'm proud of a true American tradition
Patriotic to the core is how I'm livin'
They can't take your pride if you don't give it
I'll fight til my last breath
I'll fight til my last breath
To keep Her breathing
