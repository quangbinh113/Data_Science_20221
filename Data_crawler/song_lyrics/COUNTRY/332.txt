Song Name: You Don't Know Her Like I Do
Hey old friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Yeah, she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
It might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it
'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
I can't forget, I'm drowning away these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'd stop hurting
And don't try to tell me she ain't worth it
'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
Not like I do
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
There's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
No you'll never know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
Not like I do
Not like I do
Mm
Never understand
That girl's my best friend
That girl's my best friend, yeah, yeah
That girl's my best friend
