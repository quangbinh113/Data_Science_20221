Song Name: Lyin' low
It's been a few years now since I've felt an urge to roam
I been livin' up the holler watchin' my children grow
I'm doin' just fine keepin' my mind, a daughter ain't a worry of mine
I'm like a bull to the slaughter, a fish out of water every time I leave the wood line
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
On the north side of the mountain reapin' what I sow
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
In a better way than my Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low
If I keep runnin' with the masses I'll find myself in an early casket
If there's water in the well don't go doin' somethin' drastic
There's fruit on my vinе so bring on the wine I got so little timе
I'll take what I got, save a few shots and [drive out on the decline?]
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
On the north side of the mountain reapin' what I sow
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
In a better way than my Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
On the north side of the mountain where my [ginseng?] grows
I'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low
In a better way than my Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low
