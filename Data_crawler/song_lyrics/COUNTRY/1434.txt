Song Name: Marfa Lights
Take me out west
Take me on a quest
You told me not to change out of my cheap denim dress
Oh no
Two lovers on the run
Like a bullet from a gun
And if love is just a game
Well, then I think we've won
Oh, I'll be your cosmic cowgirl
If you'll be my moonlit sky
I'll chase you around
Low and high
We're just out of reach
We're just out of sight
Like the Marfa Lights
Like the Marfa Lights
Take me by heart
Take me by my hand
Let's dance across the horizon in the desert sand
Oh, I'll be your cosmic cowgirl
If you'll be my moonlit sky
I'll chase you around
Low and high
We're just out of reach
We're just out of sight
Like the Marfa Lights
Like the Marfa Lights
Everything I thought I knew about love
It was a lie
I cross my humble heart
And hope to die
If I ever had to say goodbye
Oh, I'll be your cosmic cowgirl
If you'll be my moonlit sky
I'll chase you around
Low and high
We're just out of reach
We're just out of sight
Like the Marfa Lights
Like the Marfa Lights
Like the Marfa Lights
Like the Marfa Lights
