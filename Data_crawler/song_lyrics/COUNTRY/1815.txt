Song Name: Best Thing Since Backroads
I got one that I take to a honey hole
Where the bluegill always bite
And one that's a shortcut to anywhere
As long as you ain't short on time
I been down every one in this town
At least a couple thousand times
They can get these four wheels from A to B
Oh, but they can't take me where you take me
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
Pedal to the medal with the windows down
Sunshine setting on a cross that saved me
Hanging from a rearview in red dirt clouds
Two-lane heaven's one hell of a view
But it ain't got nothing on you
Driving this good old country boy crazy
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
I can show you one nobody knows
It turns into Sediment Creek
We can get a little moonlight, mud on the tires
Baby, if you know what I mean
Angel in the front seat, yeti in back
Out here connecting dots on a map
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
Pedal to the medal with the windows down
Sunshine setting on a cross that saved me
Hanging from a rearview in red dirt clouds
Two-lane heaven's one hell of a view
But it ain't got nothing on you
Driving this good old country boy crazy
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
Pretty as a windshield
Painted with a blue sky
Out here in a leather seat, seat belt buckled
In the middle of July
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
Pedal to the medal with the windows down
Sunshine setting on a cross that saved me
Hanging from a rearview in red dirt clouds
Two-lane heaven's one hell of a view
But it ain't got nothing on you
Driving this good old country boy crazy
You're the best thing since backroads, baby
Yeah, you're the best thing since backroads, baby
Yeah, you're the best thing since backroads, baby
