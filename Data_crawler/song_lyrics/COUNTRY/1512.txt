Song Name: Country Boy (feat. Charlie Daniels, Chris Young, & George Jones)
Now, I grew up down an old dirt road
In a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks
Back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker
Back in the day, he put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man
And the whiskey's known to change a man
That's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul
To the devil in L.A.
He said, sign here on the dotted line
And your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset
He put me up at the Marquee
He said, you wanna sell a million records, boy
You better listen to me
He said, change your style, widen your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?
I said
No, that's not me
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of heaven's chasing white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land
And really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake
With a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says
And I'll take that to my grave
Because
This is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again
'Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again
'Cause my family's always faught and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
