Song Name: One Hell Of An Amen
Preacher said he died too young
Over there, totin' that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mama 'n Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to Dad and started prayin'
Yeah, he went out, 21 guns blazin'
That's one hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
Yeah, this is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an Amen
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled 'n said, "Bring it on!"
Well, if you think I'm scared
You got me all wrong
Nah, a little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
And started prayin'
Lord, he never gave up
Said the good Lord's waitin'
Thats one hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
If this is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an amen
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an Amen, Amen
That's a hell of an Amen
