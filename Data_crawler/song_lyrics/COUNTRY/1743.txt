Song Name: House Party
You're on the couch, blowin' up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soir√©e
If you're in the mood sit tight right where you are, babe
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm gonna bring the good time home to you
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shakin' the floor, rattlin' the roof (roof's on fire)
We'll go to town like they're in your livin' room
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm gonna bring the good time home to you
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
