Song Name: More Hearts Than Mine
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you around the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk a few things out
Before we hit the road
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tyres
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishing but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tyres
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me crying
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine
