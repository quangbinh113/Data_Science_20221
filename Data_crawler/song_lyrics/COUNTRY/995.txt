Song Name: what do i
I still smell the leather mixed with cologne
The scents falling heavy when I'm alone
And I wonder, do I haunt you too?
All the whispered words, did you mean them at all?
Was I just another number that you'd call
On a late night in an empty room?
Do you think of me underneath the moonlit sky
Took six months to heal and I don't know why
You're coming back now when I was almost over you
What am I, what am I, what am I gonna say?
When I see you again I don't wanna pretend
And look the other way
Oh, what am I, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Don't know if you miss me
Do you even forgive me for walking out on you?
What do I do?
What do I do?
Will my heart start skipping over your eyes?
Will you mess with my rhythm, ruin my night?
Will I fall into you, only to lose myself again?
Are you still as reckless as you were back then?
Learned your lessons or do you pretend
That you're better just to fool somebody new
What am I, what am I, what am I gonna say?
When I see you again I don't wanna pretend
And look the other way
Oh, what am I, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Can't deny what you gave me
But could you really blame me for walking out on you?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What am I, what am I, what am I gonna say?
When I see you again I don't wanna pretend
And look the other way
Oh, what am I, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Can't deny what you gave me
But could you really blame me for walking out on you?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
