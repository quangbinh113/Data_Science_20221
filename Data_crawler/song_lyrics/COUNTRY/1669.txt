Song Name: Blood Moon
Deal me in, deal me out
Pick me out of a crowd
In the dark, all alone
I'll go anywhere but home
Blow me up, hold me down
Split me like an atom bomb
Turn the key, hit the road
I'll go anywhere but home
And there's a blood moon way up in the sky
Blood in my nose, blood in my eyes
Blood moon orange and an orange bud light
You and me baby in the heat of the night
Don't think I'm ever gonna come down
There's too many bars on this side of town
Too many bars and the look in your eyes
Give you my blood if you give me your
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Tell me that you'll never leave even if it's a lie
I'm'a double down on what I said in the morning light
21, 32, take me to the end of time
Nothing lasts forever 'cept maybe you and I
And there's a blood moon way up in the sky
Blood in my nose, blood in my eyes
Blood moon orange and an orange bud light
You and me baby in the heat of the night
Don't think I'm ever gonna come down
There's too many bars on this side of town
Too many bars and the look in your eyes
Give you my blood if you give me your
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
