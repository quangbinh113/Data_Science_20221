Song Name: Make Me Want To
Long legs, cut off jeans
Pulling me in like a magnet
Your eyes locked on me
I knew right then I had to have you
Right here in the middle of the floor
Of this hole-in-the-wall on a back street
I knew I had to get close to you
Girl what's your name, what you drinking
Yeah what's your favorite song
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to
Soft hands touching on me
Lighting me up like a bonfire
Your hips are making me think
This is gonna be an all-nighter
Right here in the middle of the crowd
You're the center of the world on a barstool
Oh yeah I had to get close to you, girl
Girl what's your name, what you drinking
Yeah what's your favorite song
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to
We'll be sneaking on out to your car, car, car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark, dark, dark
Girl what's your name, what you drinking
Yeah what's your favorite song
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to
(You're gonna make me want to)
You're gonna make me want to
You're gonna make me want to, want to, want to
