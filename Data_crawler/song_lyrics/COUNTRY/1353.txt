Song Name: Mountain Song
One, two, three
Mountain, mountain
It's good to see your face
Mighty wonder
High above the plains
Mountain, mountain
Could I take your place?
River, river
Take me away
Wash me clean
Keep my sins at bay
River, river
Take me away
Piñon perfume blowin' in the wind
Time ain't a thing here
Luck is my best friend
Carrying with me everything I own and who I am
Pray to God I see your face again
Pray to God I see your face again
Stars are burnin'
Up in the sky
Celestial angels
Teach me how to fly
Stars are burnin'
Won't you take me on high?
Take me on high
Pine tree campfire
End of the night
Embers burnin'
Shedding you light
Bottle of Blanton's
Got me feeling right
Mountain, mountain
Keep me company tonight
Piñon perfume blowin' in the wind
Time ain't a thing here
Luck is my best friend
Carrying with me everything I own and who I am
Pray to God I see your face again
Pray to God I see your face again
