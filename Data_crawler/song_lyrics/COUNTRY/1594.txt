Song Name: Golden Ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago on a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings there on display
She smiles an' nods her head as he says, "Honey, that's for you
It's not much, but it's the best that I can do"
Golden rings with one tiny little stone
(Golden ring)
Waiting there for someone to take you home
(Waiting there)
By itself, it's just a cold metallic thing
(By itself)
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks and happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring, I thee wed"
Golden rings with one tiny little stone
(Golden ring)
Shining ring now at last it's found a home
(Shining ring)
By itself, it's just a cold metallic thing
(By itself)
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a small two room apartment as they fought their final round
He says, "You won't admit it, but I know you're leavin' town"
She says, "One thing's for certain, I don't love you any more"
And throws down the ring as she walks out the door
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
(Golden ring)
Cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
(Cast aside)
By itself, it's just a cold metallic thing
(By itself)
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago on a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings there on display
Golden ring
