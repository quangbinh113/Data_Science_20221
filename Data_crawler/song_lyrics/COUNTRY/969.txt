Song Name: Eyes Fall
When you're not feeling strong
Everything is wrong
And you can't find the song
To embrace where you've gone
When your eyes fall to the ground, you know
I hope you can call on me
I will come to you with a song
So you're not alone
Going down to the gates
Paddy wagon's await
And you step in the shade
To avoid the masquerade
When your eyes fall to the ground, you know
I hope you can call on me
I will come to you with a song
So you're not alone
When your eyes fall to the ground, you know
I hope you can call on me
I will come to you with a song
So you're not alone
When your eyes fall to the ground, you know
I hope you can call on me
I will come to you with a song
So you're not alone
