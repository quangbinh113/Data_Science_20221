Song Name: Too Bad (feat. Randy Rogers)
You never said nothin' about L.A.
Well I got here on a hot day
Took a look around
Said "well now nobody here looks like you anyway"
?????????
Stuck a handful of flowers in a Goodwill vase
Said right out loud "Girl you're home
And this is what it feels like all alone"
You ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch
You ain't in this kitchen dragging all the dishes out
You've won't walkever this hall never make this bed
I got you out of my heart after all – it's too bad you're in my head
You never said nothin' about leavin'
Now every Tuesday feels like leavin'??
Try not to think about it talk about it
It's usually Friday before I'm feelin'
Good enough to wander around town
Find nobody and just hang out now
But it's under my skin
Keeps creepin' in
It's hard to believe
I still can't believe
I ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch
And I ain't in this kitchen dragging all the dishes out
I ain't ever walked this hall I've never make this bed
Oh, I got you out of my heart after all – too bad you're in my head
Oh I could call
And I won't answer
Is this all
I think it is
And I know it is
We ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch
We ain't in this kitchen dragging all the dishes out
We won't ever walk this hall mess up this king-sized bed
I got you out of my heart after all – too bad you're in my head
Oh, I got you out of my heart after all – too bad you're in my head
