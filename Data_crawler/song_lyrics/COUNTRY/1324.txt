Song Name: What If I Never Get Over You - Piano Version
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But the movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
What if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him, yeah, all I see is you
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
What if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, what if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if it never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?
I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
What if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave (what if I gave) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to?
What if I never get over? (oh, if I never get over)
What if I never get over you?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) What if I never get over you? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, what if I never get over (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Over you? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
