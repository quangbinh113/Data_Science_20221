Song Name: Songs About You
I was walkin' in Chicago by a Rigbyville bar
Caught a scent of your perfume when I heard "Dancing In The Dark"
Now I'm just tryna get through
These songs about you
I was pickin' up a bottle at the neighborhood store
But heard "I Can't Make You Love Me" and I 'bout ran back out the door
Too soon, I'm just tryna get through
These songs about you, mmm
'Cause sometimes, they make me dance
Sometimes, they make me cry
Sometimes, they make wish that I had never said goodbye
Now I'm just tryna get through
These songs about you
I was lost in her green eyes, finally went on a date (oh-oh)
I thought I might be movin' on 'til I heard "Brown Eyed Girl" play
Back to just tryna get through
These songs about you, mmm
'Cause sometimes, they make me dance
Sometimes, they make me cry
Sometimes, they make wish that I had never said goodbye
Now I'm just tryna get through
These songs about
All the lonely nights, the break-up make-up fights
The what the hell am I doin' without you in my life?
Oh, I'm just tryna get through
These songs about you, oh
Oh, tell it, oh
Woah
Ah, Lord
Ah, no, yeah

I go on keep on livin'
In a world that (livin' in a world) always has you in it
I can't stop humming your tune, woah, no
'Cause sometimes, you make me dance
Sometimes, you make me cry (make me cry)
Sometimes, you make wish that I had never said goodbye
Now I'm just tryna get through
Woah, I'm just tryna get through
Woah, I'm just tryna get through
These songs about you, mmm
