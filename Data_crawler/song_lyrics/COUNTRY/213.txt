Song Name: Girl Crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a hard rush
It's slowin' down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's givin' you now
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowin' down
