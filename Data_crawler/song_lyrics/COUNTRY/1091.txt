Song Name: GIVE HEAVEN SOME HELL
Can't believe that you got me in a suit and tie
I had to take a pull so I wouldn't cry
You got a line out the church door saying goodbye
Yeah, I believe 'em when they say you're in a better place
You had a wild side, but you had amazing grace
I know you're way off up in them clouds
But If you can still hear me right now
I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
I hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how ya got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the Man Upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down till I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
Till then give heaven some hell
I bet you're looking for a crew like we had
Bunch a noise, making boys that like to live fast
Burning rubber in a parking lot
Man, I don't know if the other side's ready or not but
I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
I hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how ya got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the Man Upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down till I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
Till then give heaven some hell
I was there when you raised your hand
Heads bowed singing "Just as I Am"
Walking that aisle, praying that prayer
Man, it ain't right, but if ya gotta be there
I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
I hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how ya got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the Man Upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down till I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
Till then give heaven some hell
I was there when you raised your hand
Heads bowed singing "Just as I Am"
Man it ain't right, man it ain't fair
I'll see you again, but till then give heaven some hell
