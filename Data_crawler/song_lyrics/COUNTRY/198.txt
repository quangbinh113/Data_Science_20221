Song Name: Burning House
I had a dream about a burnin' house
You were stuck inside
I couldn't get you out

Laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems, I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone
I've been sleepwalkin'
Been wanderin' all night
Tryin' to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalkin'
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burnin' house
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back
But people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems, I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you 'til this dream is gone
I've been sleepwalkin'
Been wanderin' all night
Tryin' to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalkin'
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burnin' house
The flames are gettin' bigger now
In this burnin' house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burnin' house
Oh and I don't want to wake up
In this burnin' house
And I've been sleepwalkin'
Been wanderin' all night
Tryin' to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalkin'
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burnin' house
