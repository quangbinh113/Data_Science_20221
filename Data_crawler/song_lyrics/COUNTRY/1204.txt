Song Name: Kick It In The Sticks
Welcome to the home of a hillbilly, yeah baby
It's a land of barbed wire, moonshine, whiskey
Park your car 'fore you get it stuck
Go on grab you a beer and get on up in the truck
It's goin' down tonight, it's all on me
It's B-Y-O-B and I've got all we need
Yeah boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys havin' a dang good time
We crank it up down, we get loud
Throwin' down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
So pop a top and drop a tailgate
Yeah, we crankin' up AC DC, Hank, Skynyrd and George Strait
Where's the girls? 'Bout to call 'em up
A little southern drawl said, "Hey trouble, what's up?"
It's goin' down tonight, now they're pullin' up
We got the jacked up trucks so slap covered in mud
Bikini tops and daisy duke denim
Hoppin' out, singin' outlaw women down on
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys havin' a dang good time
We crank it up, we get loud
We're throwin' down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playin' an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
Hey boy, hit this mason jar one time
Burned you a little bit, didn't it?
Take it easy alright
Don't let nobody take you snipe hunting? Come on
We'll do a little frog giggin', cow tippin'
Now how 'bout a little skinny dippin', bass fishin'?
Take it easy on the shine, stay away from other boy's women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
These boys tough down here
Get your ass tore up down here
And be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers they all came
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys havin' a dang good time
We crank it up down here, we get loud
We're throwin' down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playin' an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
