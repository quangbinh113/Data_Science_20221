Song Name: Try Losing One
It's hard to get a number
It's hard to get that dance
It's hard to talk a girl
Into ditching all her friends
It's hard to get that first kiss
It's hard to make one fall
It's hard to get the courage
Up to give her dad a call
And if all that ain't hard enough
Try losing one
Try walking through the door of an empty house
Try staring at the wall pouring whiskey out
Try living with knowing that you let her down
Try trying like hell not to think about
That hurt in her eyes as she turned around
If you think finding a girl you can't live without
Is the hardest thing you've ever done
Try losing one
It's hard to come home early
Them last call home come so late
Pride is hard to swallow
And sorry is hard to say
And taking her for granted
Is an easy thing to do
And if you wanna see the kind of hell
A girl can put you through
Try losing one
Try walking through the door of an empty house
Try staring at the wall pouring whiskey out
Try living with knowing that you let her down
Try trying like hell not to think about
That hurt in her eyes as she turned around
If you think finding a girl you can't live without
Is the hardest thing you've ever done
Try losing one

Try losing one
Try missing her every night holding on
Barely getting by a love like they
It might be hard to find
But try losing one
Try walking through the door of an empty house
Try staring at the wall pouring whiskey out
Try living with knowing that you let her down
Try trying like hell not to think about
That hurt in her eyes as she turned around
If you think finding a girl you can't live without
Is the hardest thing you've ever done
Try losing one
Try losing one
