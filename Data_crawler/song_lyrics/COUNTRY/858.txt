Song Name: A Candle in the Window
There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy who looks like me
And it's always the same, there's a stocking with my name
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
Now it don't take a lot of money, oh, to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window
Oh, and Christmas in your heart, in your heart
Maybe it's just wishful thinking
I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie mama's baking
It's Christmas Eve
There's a candle in the window
There's a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
Now it don't take lots of money, hmm, to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
Wherever the years may take me, no matter how far I go
There's gonna be a candle burning
It's always nice to know
That it don't take a lot of money, oh, to know what riches are
A simple candle in the window
Oh, and Christmas in your heart
In your heart, your heart
Just a candle in the window
Just a candle in the window
