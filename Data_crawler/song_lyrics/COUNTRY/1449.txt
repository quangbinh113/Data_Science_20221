Song Name: Live Off
I live off crumpled dollars
From an old pickle jar
I live off what I'm growin'
In the back of the yard
Folgers hot in the mornin'
Sun shinin' on my doublewide
I live off seven hours
With a dog in the bed
I live off of them letters
Written in crimson red
Sunday talks with my mama
Porch pickin' and my chicken fried
I live off a back road
In a small town
Story like my daddy before me
And his daddy before that
I live off a hard day's work
Penny saved, penny earned
Just to keep this shirt on my back
Aw yeah
I live off of a good man's lovin'
With tough in his blood
And a heart of pure gold
From the very first breath
I breathe to my last "you all"
I ain't ever gonna turn
The way I live off
I live off swappin' stories
With some friends 'round the fire
I live off gassin' up
Gettin' mud on the tires
Bourbon on sonic ice
And a damn good country song
I live off a back road in a small town
Story like my daddy before me
And his daddy before that
I live off a hard day's work
Penny saved, penny earned
Just to keep this shirt on my back
Aw yeah
I live off of a good man's lovin'
With tough in his blood
And a heart of pure gold
From the very first breath
I breathe to my last "you all"
I ain't ever gonna turn
The way I live off
Well I'm livin' up and passin' down
'Til they lay me in the ground
I live off a back road in a small town
Story like my daddy before me
And his daddy before that
I live off a hard day's work
Penny saved, penny earned
Just to keep this shirt on my back
Aw yeah
I live off of a good man's lovin'
With tough in his blood
And a heart of pure gold
From the very first breath
I breathe to my last "you all"
I ain't ever gonna turn the way I live off
(Ain't no way)
I'ma turn the way I live off
(Ain't no way)
Never, turn the way I live off
(Ain't no way)
I'ma turn the way I live off
(Ain't no way)
Never
