Song Name: Beer Never Broke My Heart
I've had a largemouth bass, bust my line
A couple of beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't ever let me down
Longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red tail lights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
Longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
It's gripping down on a cold one
'Cause longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart
