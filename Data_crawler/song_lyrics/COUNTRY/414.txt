Song Name: Redneck Yacht Club
I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an' fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the water's fine
Just idle on over an' toss us a line
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
Bermuda's, flip-flops and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m, that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
When the party's over and we're all alone
We'll be makin' waves in a no-wake zone
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
Redneck Yacht Club
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
The Redneck Yacht Club
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
