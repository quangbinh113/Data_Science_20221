Song Name: Heartbreak In Boots
He walked in, in those white stitched Luccheses
I'd be pushing up daisies if his looks could kill
He said, "Where you from?"
I said, "None of your business"
He said I should visit, maybe one day, I will
He smiled and I laughed and he sat down
And I wish I knew then what I know now
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
He'll walk right out on you
Like the last call, whiskey he shoots
It's a good kinda burn 'til it hurts and you learn
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
He spurn me 'round to George Straight in the kitchen
Singin' and kissin' me down the hall
I thought we'd ride out (we'd ride out) in the sunset together
I didn't know better until he took off and now he's gone
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
He'll walk right out on you
Like the last call, whiskey he shoots
It's a good kinda burn 'til it hurts and you learn
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
He left 'em by the bed, sometimes on the porch
Had one foot in and one out the door
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
He'll walk right out on you
Like the last call, whiskey he shoots
It's a good kinda burn 'til it hurts and you learn
That boy's a heartbreak in boots
True love, ain't always true (ain't always true)
Yeah, that boy's a heartbreak in boots
Mmm, yes he is
