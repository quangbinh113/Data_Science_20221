Song Name: The Man With The Bag
Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again
He's got a sleigh full, it's not gonna stay full
Stuff that he's dropping every stop of the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again
He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again
Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle
All the bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again
He's got a sleigh full, and it's not gonna stay full
Got stuff that he's dropping every stop of the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again
He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting, they're all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag
Better watch out now!
