Song Name: All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan
Ooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands, put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro' with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin', "Silent Night" with the palm trees a-blowin'
Ooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Well, if you're thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a present this year
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How 'bout two tickets to a tropical shore
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore?
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill
And pi√±a coladas in the blender chillin'
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands, put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro' with the rhythm of the ocean (rockin')
Singin', "Silent Night" with the palm trees a-blowin' (palm trees)
Ooh (baby, don't you think? Baby)
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan? (It's a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Well, everybody's prayin' for a Christmas so white
Come to think about it, that'd be alright
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground
And every day our skin gets a little more brown
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree (we'll string some lights)
I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us, baby, on the beach hand in hand (I can see us, baby)
Rockin' to and fro' with the rhythm of the ocean (rockin' to the rhythm)
Baby, won't you say, you and me we'll be goin'?
Ooh (baby, don't you think? Baby, don't you think?)
I can almost feel my toes in the sand (feel my toes in the sand)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Don't worry, baby, we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades and a brand-new bikini
We won't have to worry 'bout the holiday rush
It'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love
Ooh (baby, don't you think? Baby)
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan (it's a real good, real good)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan (real, real good, real, real good)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
