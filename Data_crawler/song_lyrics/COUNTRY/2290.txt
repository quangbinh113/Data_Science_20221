Song Name: There Goes Another Love Song
Sometimes I feel like I'm gettin' kinda low
Thoughts I am thinkin' are the reason and so
I try to remember without talkin' to myself
Things that I've said or maybe things that I felt about you
Sittin' in a corner of a crowded bar room
People all around me and I still feel alone
Just when I know I'm gonna break down and cry
Someone plays a tune that dries a tear from my eye
There goes another love song
Someone's singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend
Lonesome and lonely and far from my home
Tried to get back to where I know I belong
Wishin' and hopin' I was already there
I just heard a voice, it whispered in my ear
Singin', there goes another love song
Someone's singin about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend
There goes another love song
Someone's singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend
I said, there goes another love song
Someone's singin' about me again (oh, good Lord)
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend
