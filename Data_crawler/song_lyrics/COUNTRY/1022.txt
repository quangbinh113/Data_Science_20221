Song Name: Sleeping Single In A Double Bed - Single Version
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone, oh
Sleeping single in a double bed
Tossing, turning trying to forget
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry
'Cause drinking doubles alone don't make it a party
Another sleepless night and it's the same old story
When you're the only one at two in the morning
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone
Sleeping single in a double bed
Tossing, turning trying to forget
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone
Sleeping single in a double bed
Tossing, turning trying to forget
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
