Song Name: Drunk On A Plane
I took two weeks vacation for the honey moon
A couple tickets, all inclusive down in Canc√∫n
I couldn't get my money back, so I'm in seat seven A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the feller on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seat back right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottle filling both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G Six
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm gettin' drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom
Alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G Six
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks of everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G Six
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now, I'm drunk on a plane
