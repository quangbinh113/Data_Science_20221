Song Name: Out of Nowhere
Yeah, them skyscrapers that we built
Come in the form of a water tower
Them cops hide right behind the sign
Better drive 25 miles and hour
Ain't on the map, if you blink then you miss it
Yeah, we know what it is and what it isn't
'Cause we come out of nowhere
That you never heard of
We ain't burning blacktop
Nah, we kickin' dirt up
Shotgun shooting stop signs
Red light revin' red lights
Know who made the moon
And know who makes the moonshine
Come out of them turn rows where that corn grows
We turn it into that whiskey
If you wonder why we live the way we livin'
'Cause we come out of nowhere
We come out of nowhere
Our Sunday suits, our working boots
And a pair of jeans that come from Wrangler
Bottle of wine, two Dixie cups
In the back of your truck is the way to make 'em
Fall for your heart wrap her up in your Carhartt jacket
That's the way that it happens
'Cause we come out of nowhere
That you never heard of
We ain't burning blacktop
Nah, we kickin' dirt up
Shotgun shooting stop signs
Red light revin' red lights
Know who made the moon
And know who makes the moonshine
Come out of them turn rows where that corn grows
We turn it into that whiskey
If you wonder why we live the way we livin'
'Cause we come out of nowhere
Come out of them turn rows where that corn grows
We turn it into that whiskey
If you wonder why we live the way we livin'
'Cause we come out of nowhere
That you never heard of
We ain't burning blacktop
Nah, we kickin' dirt up
Shotgun shooting stop signs
Red light revin' red lights
Know who made the moon
And know who makes the moonshine
Come out of them turn rows where that corn grows
We turn it into that whiskey
If you wonder why we live the way we livin'
'Cause we come out of nowhere
We come out of nowhere
We come out of nowhere
Yes, we do
