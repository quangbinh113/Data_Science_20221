Song Name: Little Red Wagon
You only love me for my
Big sun glasses
And my Tony Lomas
And my Dodge Dart classic
You said, "I'll be Johhny and you be June
And I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken, and the axel's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault
When I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
A-ooh
Ah
Ooh
Ah
Kick it
Yeah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Oh, heaven help me I've been
Sewing wildflower seeds
And chasing tumble weeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just trying to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you, babe
So guess what?
Ah, ah, you can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken, and the axel's draggin'
No, you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault
When I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh
Ah
Ooh
Ah
Ooh, you only love me for my
Big sun glasses
And my Tony Lomas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got
Long
Blonde
Hair
And I play guitar, and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama, ya'll
I love my apron
But I ain't your mama!
So guess what?
WHAT?
Ah ah, you can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axel's draggin'
No, you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault
When I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh
Ahh
Ooooh yeah
Ahh
Ooooh, HA!
