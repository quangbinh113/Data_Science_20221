Song Name: To Die For
We buried all our guns in the ground
And destroyed all the evidence
Knew that they'd be bringing hell down on us
For us, bringing hell down on them
We watched as they chose to ignore
The changing of the guard and the sound
We were few, but we were ready for war
A war, to burn this place to the ground
And it breaks my heart to think about
We will never be the same again
Here I've been, still trying to figure me out
When I should have been worried about them
We knew that we were going to fight
A fight we knew that we wouldn't win
To stand with those who believe
By my side, by their side
Was worth our death in the end
From now 'til the end of time
The streets forever stained with our blood
In a town where dreams surely come to die
Every time the lights shine
Yeah, they'll be thinking of us
And it breaks my heart to think about
We will never be the same again
Here I've been, still trying to figure me out
When I should have been worried about them
I remember when you sat me down
Held on to every word that you said to me
You were spitting selfish lies from your mouth
Now I'm older and grown and know they don't mean a thing
And it breaks my heart to think about
We will never be the same again
Here I've been, still trying to figure me out
When I should have been worried about them
And it breaks my heart to think about
We will never be the same again
Here I've been, still trying to figure me out
When I should have been worried about them
