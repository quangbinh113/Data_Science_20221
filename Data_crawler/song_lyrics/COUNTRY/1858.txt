Song Name: Dibs
I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?
And tell me are you tryna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I got your attention
Did I mention?
If you got a kiss on your lips
That you're lookin' for somebody to take (hey)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid to love
Ain't afraid to break (hey)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just sayin', "I ain't got nowhere to be"
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah, I'll callin' dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm callin' dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine
Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
'Cause boy I got to mark it
Ooooh, so they can all back off (yeah)
'Cause I know what I want
And while I got you listenin'
Come on and show me what I'm missin', yeah
If you you got a kiss on your lips
That you're lookin' for somebody to take (hey)
If you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love
Ain't afraid to break (hey)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just sayin', "I ain't got nowhere to be"
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah, I'm callin' dibs
If you got a kiss on your lips
That you're lookin' for somebody to take, hey
If you got a heart that ain't afraid to love
Ain't afraid to break, hey
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just sayin', "I ain't got nowhere to be"
So baby I'll take whatever it is you got to give
Yeah, I'm callin' dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm callin' dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine
Yeah, boy I'm callin' dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm callin' dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine, yeah
I'm callin' dibs on your lips, on your kiss, on your time, boy
I'm just tryna make you mine, boy
Ooh
Dibs
