Song Name: Missing You
Missing you used to mean 2 a.m. grab the keys
In the car, on your street, knocking back two or three
Missing you used to mean messing up
Telling my friends, "No, it's just this once"
Missing you used to mean showing up where you go
Calling it happenstance, second night in a row
Missing you used to mean it's getting late
I had a couple drinks, I should probably stay but
If I ever, if I ever wanna try and get over you
I know what I'm supposed to do
I gotta make missing you just mean missing you
Missing you
If we're together, then I'll never get to cutting your memory loose
I know what I gotta do
I gotta make missing you just mean
Missing you
Missing you has got to mean we don't talk anymore
Give it time, hide the wine, put the phone in the drawer
Long as it's a game I'm bound to lose
Hardest damn thing I'm gonna have to do but
If I ever, if I ever wanna try and get over you
I know what I'm supposed to do
I gotta make missing you just mean missing you
Missing you
If we're together, then I'll never get to cutting your memory loose
I know what I gotta do
I gotta make missing you just mean
Missing you
(If I ever, if I ever, if I ever wanna) missing you
(If I ever, if I ever, if I ever wanna) missing you
(If I'm never, if I'm never, if I'm never gonna) I gotta make missing you just mean
You're gonna touch this side of town (this side of town)
Know all you're ups gotta shut it down (shut it down)
Quit ya cold (quit ya cold) gotta break it clean (break it clean)
Just so you know (so you know) it's gotta mean (it's gotta mean)
If I ever, if I ever wanna try and get over you
I know what I'm supposed to do
I gotta make missing you just mean
Missing you
If we're together, then I'll never get to cutting your memory loose (memory loose)
I know what I gotta do (gotta do)
I gotta make missing you just mean
Missing you
(If I ever, if I ever, if I ever wanna) missing you
(If I ever, if I ever, if I ever wanna) missing you
(If I'm never, if I'm never, if I'm never gonna) I gotta make missing you just mean
