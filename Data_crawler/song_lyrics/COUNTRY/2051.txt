Song Name: Shoot From The Hip
High noon in a gun slingin' town
Steel spurs clinging on the red dirt ground
Saloon doors swinging wide open
It's about to go down
Outlaws ridin' out of the hills
Shootin' moonshine and shotgun shells
A bunch of hell raisers wanna send you to your maker
No time to saddle up so you gotta act now and
Shoot from the hip, ask questions later
Shoot from the hip, come on (woo-hoo-oo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo-hoo-oo)
Shoot from the hip
The dust settles, the barrels go cold
And it's deuces wild at the watering hole
Turns out cards and hard liquor don't mix too well
And this joker with an ace up his sleeve
And a midnight special where nobody can see
I show him four of a kind, he gets red in the eye
He flips the table over, I reach for mine and
Shoot from the hip, ask questions later
Shoot from the hip, come on (woo-hoo-oo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo-hoo-oo)
Shoot from the hip
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You won't find me six feet under
You won't find me takin' cover
'Cause I'm more than the roar of the thunder
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Shoot from the hip, ask questions later
Shoot from the hip, come on (woo-hoo-oo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip
Shoot from the hip
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo-hoo-oo)
Shoot from the hip
Shoot from the hip (woo-hoo-oo)
Oh, shoot from the hip
