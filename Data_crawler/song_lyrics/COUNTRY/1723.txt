Song Name: Any Man Of Mine
Woo!
This is what a woman wants
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date that's fine
But he better be on time
Any man of mine will say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anythin' I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way"
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Woo!
Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say: "Hmm, I like it like that, yeah"
And if I changed my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way"
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Woo!
Let me hear ya say
"Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way"
(Any man, any man, any man)
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Woo!
You gotta shimmy and shake
Make the Earth quake
Kick and turn, stomp, stomp
Then you jump, heel to toe, Do Si Do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on, everybody on the floor
A-one, two, a-three, four
Hup two, hup, yeah
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants
