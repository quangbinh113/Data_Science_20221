Song Name: Stop Coming Over
Yeah, things been going good, you and me been going great
It's time to have a conversation, so girl, let's conversate
You already got a drawer, hairpins on the floor in half the bathroom
Baby, these four walls, hate it when you're gone so I have to ask ya
Hey, what you say we decorate and slap some paint on these doors?
Soon as I met you, knew I'd let you get to making it yours
We can drop that under the mat, get you a key of your own
When you're gonna stop coming over and start coming home?
Yeah, start coming home
Sleeping in till we wake up, no rushing down the stairs
Ain't gotta swing back by your place, 'cause you're already there
Ain't you tired of all this distance, all this driving around
I got a proposition, maybe something you can think about
Hey, what you say we decorate and slap some paint on these doors?
Soon as I met you, knew I'd let you get to making it yours
We can drop that under the mat, get you a key of your own
When you're gonna stop coming over and start coming home?
Yeah, start coming home
You already got a drawer, hairpins on the floor in half the bathroom
Baby, these four walls, hate it when you're gone so come on
Hey, what you say we decorate and slap some paint on these doors?
Soon as I met you, knew I'd let you get to making it yours
We can drop that under the mat, get you a key of your own
When you're gonna stop coming over and start coming home?
Yeah, start coming home
