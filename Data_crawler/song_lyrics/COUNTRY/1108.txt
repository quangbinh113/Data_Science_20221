Song Name: Helpless to Help You
When I catch you in the morning
Staring at the sun
It's as if you have been running for time
I know I've tried to fix it
And it always ends up wrong
The pieces keep on coming undone
Oh I am holding on to
Hope but my faith keeps breaking
What a love to be falling in
Going up, then down again
Water line Is Creeping high
Do I have to sink for you to fly
Every time
You're crashing
I just fuel the burning
I'm helpless to help you
You catch me in the evening
Staring at the moon
And I hide behind these early nights it's the easy thing to do
Oh I am holding on to hope but my faith keeps breaking
What a love to be falling in
Going up, then down again
Water line Is Creeping high
Do I have to sink for you to fly
Every time
You're crashing
I just fuel the burning
I'm helpless to help you
Oh I am holding on to hope
But my faith keeps breaking
What a love I won't give it up
I'll be the dam, when you're the flood
Hold my breath I hope it's enough
Float on me, I'll keep your head above
Every time
You're crashing
I just fuel the burning
Every time
You're crashing
I just feel the burning
Oh, Oh, Oh
What a love
I will give it up
What a love
