Song Name: Can't Have Mine (Find You A Girl)
You could find you a girl on a Friday night
Dancing in the back of a bar
A Sunday morning hands up high
Singing front row in the choir
You could find you a girl through a friend of a friend
Or she could show up right out of the blue
It don't matter where you find her
Just as long as you
Find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One that's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah, take it from me, that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine
Find you a girl that likes to do all the things you love to do
And even on your worst day
She still thinks you hung the moon
Find you a girl that's like fine wine that just gets better with age
Boy, you'll have it made
If you find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One that's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah, take it from me, that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine
Thank God she loves me
God knows I got so lucky
If you want one like I got, you gotta trust me
Find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One that's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah, take it from me, that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine
Nah, you can't have mine
