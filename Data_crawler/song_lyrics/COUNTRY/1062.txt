Song Name: Daydreams About Night Things
I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And while my hands make a living
My mind's home loving you
I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my daydreams come true
Well, all day long while I'm working in town
Time slows down to a crawl
When I'm not thinking about you
I'm checking the clock on the wall
Then it's goodbye factory and hello love
And there's a smile across my face
'Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love
Where my thoughts have been all day
I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And while my hands make a living
My mind's home loving you
Yes, I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my daydreams come true
Woah, I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And while my hands make a living
My mind's home loving you
Yes, I'm having daydreams about night things
In the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my daydreams come true
Yeah, every night you make my dreams come true
