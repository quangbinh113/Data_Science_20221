Song Name: Daddy's Money
Can't concentrate on the preacher preachin'
My attention span done turned off
I'm honed in on that angel singin'
Up there in the choir loft
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me
Her second cousin was my third grade teacher
I used to cut her grandma's grass
Back then she was nothin' but knees and elbows
Golly did she grow up fast
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me
Lord if you got any miracles handy
Maybe you could grant me one
Just let me walk down the aisle
And say I do
To that angel with a choir robe on
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And she's lookin' at me, yeah!
