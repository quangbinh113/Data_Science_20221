Song Name: Whatcha Gonna Do With A Cowboy
Ladies, I guess this question is for you
Has anybody here got any idea what you gonna do with a cowboy?
One, two
I can see you got your eye on this old cowboy
I can tell you've never had one for your own
No, you've never been around one
Now you're thinkin that you've found one
Well, it might be kinda fun to take him home
You giggle every time that I say, "Yes, ma'am"
And I get this feelin' if I held you tight
You'd be seein' his and hers
Buckles, boots, and spurs
Well, that's a feelin' you'll get over overnight
'Cause whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn?
When he's lyin' there instead
Of gettin out of bed
And puttin on his boots and gettin gone
What you gonna do when he says
"Honey, well, I've got half a mind to stay"
What you gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away?
Alright, fiddle
You can see it takes a special kinda woman
To put up with the life a cowboy leads
'Cause his boots are always muddy
And his beer drinkin' buddies
Will camp out on your couch and never leave
Don't even start to think you re gonna change him
You'd be better off to try and rope the wind
What he is is what you got
And he can't be what he's not
Oh and, honey, you can't hide him from your friends
So whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn?
When he's lyin' there instead
Of gettin out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin gone
What you gonna do when he says
"Honey, well, I've got half a mind to stay"
What you gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away?
Yeah, what you gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away?
Thanks Garth
