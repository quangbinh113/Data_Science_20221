Song Name: Hard Livin'
I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
Get outta hand
A rought and rowdy honky tonk man
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Never thought it would happen to me

But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Woo!
