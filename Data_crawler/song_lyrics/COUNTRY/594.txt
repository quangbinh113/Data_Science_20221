Song Name: You Ain't Much Fun
I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barking like a dog, howling at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' red hen
Up all night wonderin' where I been
I'd fall down and say, "Come help me, honey"
You laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny
But I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
"Girl, you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'"
Now, I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
I guess I gone out and lost all my good sense
Too much work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself
And now feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's, "Honey, do this, honey, do that"
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
"Girl, you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'"
Now, I'm fixin' the sink and I'm mowin' the grass
You made me a list and I'm bustin' my wheel
All broke down, tail's been draggin'
It's a rough ol' life up here on the wagon
Now I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's, "Honey, do this, honey, do that"
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
"Girl, you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'"
Yeah, I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
"Girl, you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'"
