Song Name: Seasons Don't Change
Used to get a winter, used to get a fall
Used to get things that matter most of all
Like a little bit of snow on a December night
Changing of the leaves, keep October bright
Everyday's changing in the atmosphere you see
Everyday's changing 'cause of you and me
I remember April when the rains came down
In the month of May, flowers all around
It don't stop, Noah had the sign
Momma take the baby 'cause the river's rising high
Watch a car flow down the Main Street sign
Water touch a needle on a low hanging pine
So, roll, yeah momma roll
Seasons don't change
Just the same they come and go
June, July and August hotter than a furnace
Fires like a piston with goddamn purpose
Scrambling eggs on a hot tin roof
Pacing back and forth not knowing what to do
Think I'll get back to the Tennessee State Line
Let the cool water ease my worried mind
January, February, March we'd dream
Of the hot summer sun and a Georgia peach tree
Now I'm wearing short pants on Valentine's Day
Don't hold no degree, but I think it's safe to say
Everyday's changing in the atmosphere you see
Everyday's changing 'cause of you and me
So, roll, yeah momma roll
Seasons don't change
Just the same they come and go
So, roll, yeah momma roll
Seasons don't change
Just the same they come and go
Season's don't change
Just the same they come and go
