Song Name: Jingle Bells
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
(Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight and sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob tailed bay two forty as his speed
And hitch him to an open sleigh and crack you'll take the lead
(Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
