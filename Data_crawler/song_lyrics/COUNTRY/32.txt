Song Name: Hell Yeah
Hell, no
I don't talk about you no more
What would I do that for?
Ain't no need messin' with my good time
Hell, no
I don't sit around by myself
Feelin' better than I've ever felt
At least I know that's what it looks like
Hell yeah, I go get drunk on Friday nights
Hell yeah, I'm dancing under neon lights
Hell yeah, I'm smiling so that you can't tell
But if you're ever wondering, baby, if I'm still
Going through hell, yeah
Going through hell, yeah
You've moved on and I'm still here in hell, yeah
Hell, no
I can't get you off my mind
And out of all the things I've triеd
Tonight is gonna be hard to beat
'Cause I got friеnds with me
Hell yeah, I go get drunk on Friday nights
Hell yeah, I'm dancing under neon lights
Hell yeah, I'm smiling so that you can't tell
But if you're ever wondering, baby, if I'm still
Going through hell, yeah
Going through hell, yeah
You've moved on and I'm still here in hell, yeah
Hell yeah, I go get drunk on Friday nights (sometimes)
Hell yeah, I'm dancing under neon lights (hell, yeah)
Hell yeah, I'm smiling so that you can't tell
But if you're ever wondering, baby, if I'm still
Going through hell, yeah
Going through hell, yeah
You've moved on and I'm still here in hell, yeah
Going through hell, yeah
Going through hell, yeah
You've moved on and I'm still here in hell, yeah
