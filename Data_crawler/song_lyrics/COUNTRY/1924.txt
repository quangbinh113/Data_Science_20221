Song Name: K[no]w Better
I've read all the red letters in the bible
My parents taught me touching fire gets you burned (gets you burned)
I've watched all of the TED talks 'bout addiction
But there's a difference between "I know" and "I've learned"
So, I'm always talking to my therapist
And he's tryna talk me off the ledge
Same problems that we've tried to fix a thousand times
I know better
So, you'd think by now I'd have my shit together
But I don't and it shows every time
I drink too much, text my ex
Let the voices in my head get the best of me
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
I make promises at New Year's resolutions
Swear to God I'll get it right this time around
But then it's back to six shots deep on a Saturday night
And I know in the morning I'm paying the price
When I wake up next to her, I guess I'll never learn
Yeah, I know better
So, you'd think by now I'd have my shit together
But I don't and it shows every time
I drink too much, text my ex
Let the voices in my head get the best of me
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
I'm always talking to my therapist
And he's tryna talk me off the ledge
Same problems that we've tried to fix a thousand times
I know better
So, you'd think by now I'd have my shit together
But I don't and it shows every time
I drink too much, text my ex
Let the voices in my head get the best of me
I know better
But I'm no better, whoa
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
I'm no better
I know better
But I'm no better
I know better
I'm no better
