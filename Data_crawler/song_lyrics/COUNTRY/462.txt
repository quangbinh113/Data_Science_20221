Song Name: Brand New Girlfriend
She said, "I need sometime to find myself
I need a little space to think
Maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way to fast for me"
So, i, i picked up what was left of my pride
And i put on my walking shoes
And i got up on that high road
And i did what any gentleman would do
I, um...
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, i think im on to somethin'
Because i feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
I love it when she calls me butter cup
She laughs and says i left the toilet seat up
She pops and tosses me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When i get hungry, she takes me out
I ride the shotgun like a shitzu hound
My tails a waggin', my tounges hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, i think im on to somethin'
You know i feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
Wooo...
Cute, cute, cute...
She likes to write our names in the sand
She's hearing wedding bells and making plans
She's gonna hang around a while i guess
She hasn't even told me she loves me yet
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
We flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, i think im on to somethin'
You know i feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
She makes me feel just like a kid again
I gotta brand new girlfriend
