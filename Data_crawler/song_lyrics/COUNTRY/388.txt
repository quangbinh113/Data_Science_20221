Song Name: Live Like You Were Dying
He said "I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet times"
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya
When you get that kind of news?
Man whatcha do?
And he said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin' "
And he said, "Some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' "
He said, "I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then"
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin' "
And he said "Some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' "
"Like tomorrow was a gift
And ya got eternity to think about what to do with it
What did do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?"
"Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
Then I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'"
And he said "Some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'"
Woo
