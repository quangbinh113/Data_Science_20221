Song Name: Can't You See
I'm gonna take a freight train
Down at the station, Lord
I don't care where it goes

Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain
I'll jump off, nobody gonna know
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
I'm gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady, now
A mean ol' woman, Lord
Never told me goodbye
Can't you see, ohh, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
I'm gonna buy a ticket, now
As far as I can
Ain't a-never comin' back

Ride me a southbound
All the way to Georgia, now
Till the train, it run out of track
Can't you see, ohh, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Oh, Lord
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see (oh, she's such a crazy lady), can't you see
What that woman (what that woman) she been doin' to me
Can't you see (Lord, I can't stand), can't you see
What that woman (ohh), she been doin' to me
Can't you see (I'm gonna take a freight train)
Can't you see (down at the station, Lord)
What that woman, she been doin' to me (ain't never comin' back) oh oh
Can't you see (gonna ride me a southbound, now)
Can't you see (all the way to Georgia, Lord)
What that woman, she been doin' to me (till the train run out of track), oh
