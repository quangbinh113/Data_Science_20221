Song Name: Love Can Build A Bridge
I'd gladly walk across the desert with no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you in your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinking, let me show you what love means

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge

Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
I would whisper love so loudly, every heart could understand
That love and only love can join the trials of man

I would give my hearts' desire so that you might see
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge

Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
When we stand together, it's our finest hour

We can do anything (anything)
Anything (anything)
Keep believin' in the power
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge

Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
Yeah, yes I do
Ooh, love can build a bridge
Whoa, love and only love
Between your heart and mine
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Love and only love
Don't you think it's time?
Ooh, don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
Love and only love
Love and only love
