Song Name: homecoming queen? - ballerini album version
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie when somebody's mean?
Where do you hide?
Do people assume you're always alright?
Been so good at smiling most of your life
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells when that curtain's closed
Did your daddy teach you how to act tough?
Or more like your mama?
Sweep it under the rug
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries
Even the homecoming queen cries
Hey, homecoming queen
With tears in your eyes
Has somebody told you
It'll all be alright?
