Song Name: Dear West Virginia (feat. Brad Paisley and The West Virginia University Choir)
Take me back home
I feel like I've been away for way too long
I've seen the world, I've sang these songs
I changed so much since I've been gone
Sometimes I miss who I was those days
There's so much that I didn't know
There was you and me, those bright green eyes
And those old country roads
Dear West Virginia
You been so good to me
I'm sorry if I had to leave
But I just had to chase those dreams
Dear West Virginia
I hope I don't make you mad
When California breaks my heart
I just hope you'll take me back
I was supposed to be a big ol' star
Like my friends but it hasn't come true
Now I lie awake and I think about every mistake I can't undo
Oh, traded in my heart for a couple late nights and a Hollywood life
Why do I always have to try to be the guy that strangers can like
I'm not who I set out to be
I'm not the kid who used to dream
All these lessons in my life didn't come too cheap
California never really felt like me (really felt like me)
Dear West Virginia (dear West Virginia)
You been so good to me
I'm sorry if I had to leave
But I just had to chase those dreams
Dear West Virginia (dear West Virginia)
I hope I don't make you mad
When California breaks my heart
I just hope you'll take me back
You will always be the one that got away from me
You will always be where I found my hopes and my dreams
Dear West Virginia
(You been so good to me)
(I'm sorry if I had to leave) sorry if I had to chase those dreams
(But I just had to chase those dreams)
Dear West Virginia
(I hope I don't make you mad)
When California breaks my heart
I just hope you'll take me back
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Dear West Virginia
I hope I didn't make you mad
When California breaks my heart
I know I'll be right back
