Song Name: Stop Draggin' Your Boots - Live Acoustic
You say you want me and then you don't
One day you're whiskey hot and then you're beer cold
Sometimes you're in, sometimes you're out
Sometimes a girl gotta put her foot down
Stop draggin' your boots up onto my porch
Kickin' mud off your heels, knockin' on my door
Thinkin' I'll let you leave 'em by my bed on the floor
You ain't gonna crash your party here no more
You better get to walkin' if you don't want what you got
Either love me or not, just stop draggin' your boots
"There're more fishes out in the sea"
I can hear my mama tellin' me
"Cut 'em loose, throw 'em back if they play with your heart"
"There're plenty more boys at the bar"
Stop draggin' your boots up onto my porch
Kickin' mud off your heels, knockin' on my door
Thinkin' I'll let you leave 'em by my bed on the floor
You ain't gonna crash your party here no more
You better get to walkin' if you don't want what you got
Either love me or not, just stop draggin' your boots
Draggin' your boots
Oh, no
You're outta time (you're outta time)
Make up your mind (make up your mind)
Either you don't or you do
Stop draggin' your boots up onto my porch
Kickin' mud off your heels, knockin' on my door
Thinkin' I'll let you leave 'em by my bed on the floor
You ain't gonna crash your party here no more
You better get to walkin' if you don't want what you got
Either love me or not, just stop
Stop draggin' your boots
Stop draggin' your boots
Oh, no, oh, no
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
