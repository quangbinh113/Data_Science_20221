Song Name: Loved Me That Way (stripped)
Sometimes I call you, I know I can't reach you
To hear your voicemail, "Sorry I missed you"
Wish I could go back, tell my old self that
You don't have the time to not make time, it goes fast
And I was livin' like you'd live forever
And it took losin' you to learn to love better
To be the daughter who comes home more often
Who holds on to a goodbye hug a little longer
To be the best friend, I promise to check in
And the kind of sister my brother always needed
Who takes time to call, even just to say hey
'Cause you loved me that way
The first to show up, an hour early
Front row in the bleachers to make sure you could see me
You stood in the doorway for every goodbye
I still see you wavin' underneath the porch light
And you were livin' like you wouldn't live forever
You knew the little things in life are what matter
Like makin' those pancakes to sweeten my heartbreak
Pullin' me out of school to go fishin' on Thumb Lake
Had me sit beside you for Sunday service
Every time I'd get antsy, you'd slip me a Werther's
The first to forgive all my biggest mistakes
Yeah, you loved me that way
Yeah, you loved me that way
I had the honor to be your granddaughter
I could only hope to be half of the whole that you both were
Can only hold you in a picture frame
You held nothin' back, gave everything
You loved me that way
You loved me that way
