Song Name: Alright
Alright (alright), alright
Yeah, it's alright (alright), alright
Don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the best of Patsy Cline
Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see, I got everything I want
'Cause I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright (alright), alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright (alright), alright, yeah
I got all I need
And it's alright by me
Maybe later on, we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you
May be a simple life, but that's okay
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made
'Cause I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright (alright), alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright (alright), alright, yeah
I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
It's alright by me, yeah, yeah
When I lay down at night I thank the Lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of
'Cause I've got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright, alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, alright, yeah
I got all I need, yeah
I got all I need
And it's alright by me, oh, yeah
It's alright by me, yeah, yeah, yeah
