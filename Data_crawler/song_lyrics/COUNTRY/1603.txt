Song Name: Mule Skinner Blues (Blue Yodel No. 8)
Well good morning Captain
Good morning to you Sir
Hey hey yeah
Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run
Hey hey yeah
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Well I'm a lady mule skinner
From down old Tennessee way
Hey hey I come from Tennessee
I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Hey hey I won't take your pay
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Well hey hey little waterboy
Won't you bring your water 'round
Hey hey
If you don't like your job
Well you can throw your bucket down
Throw it down boy, throw it down
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Well I've been working down in Georgia
At a greasy spoon caf√©
Hey that lovely joint
Just to let a no good man
Call every cent of my pay
Hey hey and I'm sick of it
And wanna be a mule skinner
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Mule skinner blues
