Song Name: Say Something (feat. Chris Stapleton)
Mhm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, say something then say something
Say something then say something
Say something then say something
I don't wanna get
Caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name
Everybody says, say something
Then, say something, say something
Then, say something, say something
Then, say something
I don't want to get
Caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing
But I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing
