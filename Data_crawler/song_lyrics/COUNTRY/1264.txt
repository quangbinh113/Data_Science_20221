Song Name: Wilder Days - Acoustic
Hand in my hair and you said, "I looked pretty"
You're so devious, rolled in from the Windy City, yeah
I ain't gotta clear view
Tell me what you're wanting me to do and
You tell me every single secret in your mind
Come on, baby, we got nothing but time
You say, "I'm too young for you"
You're scared I'm too right for you

You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
The way you move your hands across my body
I'm kissin' you in a hotel lobby
Baby, I don't wanna lose this feeling
You're giving me something to believe in
And who were you before I knew your name?
Were you drunk at midnight waiting for the train?
You could have been anyone back then
Just another kid reaching for the wind
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only use to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
What were you like when you were a little wilder?
Why don't you show me?
Why don't you show me?
What you were like when you got a little higher
Just for tonight, just for tonight
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only use to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You got a secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
