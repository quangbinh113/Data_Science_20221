Song Name: Smoke A Little Smoke
Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Want a little more right and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Yeah
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course but my definition of change
Just ain't the same
I'm gonna sit around here, stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend I just don't care
I could get up, go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke, yeah
Yeah, go get her back, ooh!
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Kick back, give the blues spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back
Kick back, give the blues spin
Break out the wine, just forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash
Oh no, I don't know, baby, might take all night
Better maybe break out that old rock and roll

Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Gonna drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
