Song Name: Bottoms Up - Remix
I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Goin ninety five burning down one twenty nine yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's ridin shot gun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like, "Y'all wassup"
Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Damn
Girl I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in daisy dukes
Girl she's got ya tappin on a boys shoulder
Hey dog check this out
Man, it's how them girls do it in the dirty south, yeah
She'll have you on your knee, "Can I marry you?"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up
Get em up, get em up, get em up
Ok, usually when you see me I'm a pretty nice guy,
Pretty girl drinkin with me claimin now get high, oh.
Yeah you say shawty, betcha you do tonight.
You probably ran into me in your neighborhood,
When a hustler gained hood, he was a bad full of goodie,
The up
John
Double get told,
Shawty she a do it and I betchu she'll prove me right.
(So pop a bottle turn it up to the sky)
Let's give a toast to the good times
All y'all get your drinks up high
Everybody feelin alright
Damn right
Cause tonight it's bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
And get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
And get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
