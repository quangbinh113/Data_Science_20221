Song Name: Angel Band - Jubilee Version
Hallelujah
Jubilee
Hallelujah
Jubilee
He stands behind the pulpit
He's calling out a line
Responds to congregation
Just a little ways behind
Echoes down the streets of gold
Through the Pearly Gates
Dribbles o'er the Jordan
And it goes on by the banks
He's rattling a Werther's
On his dentures in the pew
He's holding down the bass
It's a little out of tune
But his heart is in the hymnal
And that's all a boy can do
Make a joyful sound
'Til the rest have come to roost
Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind, but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land
She's shouting' in the aisle
She's shaking somethin' fierce
Feels so good to be here
After all these faithful years
Just took a walk with Jesus
Just touched his nail-scarred hands
Didn't even bother her
That he ain't a blue-eyed man
Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind, but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land
There's Hindus, Jews, and Muslims
And Baptists of all kinds
Catholic girls and Amish boys
Who've left their plows behind
Up there in the choir
Singing' side by side
Wondering why exactly
They've been fussing the whole time
Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind, but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land
Hallelujah
Jubilee
Hallelujah
Jubilee
I can hear
The angel band
Hallelujah
