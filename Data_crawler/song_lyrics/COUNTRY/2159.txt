Song Name: Telling on My Heart
Check out the moonlight filling up the night sky
Girl, how many times that you me sat right here
It always seems to get too late
Something tells me that I oughta wait
So while I got my courage up, and my mind still clear
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
Sayin' all kinds of crazy things
Like you're the only girl for me
Oh, baby, it was meant to be
And it just feels right
Yeah, how I think about you all the time
I can't seem to keep you off my mind
Kissing ain't the only thing I wanna do to you tonight
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
You know those secrets I've been keeping
Way down deep inside of me
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
'Cause I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I wanna tell you what I think
Underneath these stars
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
