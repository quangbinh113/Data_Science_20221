Song Name: I May Hate Myself In The Morning
Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks?
And say, "How you been? I been wonderin'
If maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me?"
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
Everyone's known someone
That they just can't help but want
And even though we just can't make it work out
Well, the want-to lingers on
So once again we wind up in
Each other's arms pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I know it's wrong
But it ain't easy moving on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again?
Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be
Before everything went bad
And I guess that's what it is in lonely
Late night calls like this that we try to find
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
