Song Name: Jackie Blue
Ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides her smile when she's wearing a frown
Ooh, Jackie you're not so down
You like your life in a freeform style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup
Ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue
What's a game girl if you never lose?
Ask a winner and you'll probably find
Ooh, Jackie they've lost at some time
Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy just a natural thing
Like playing music but you never sing
Ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places where you've never been
Ooh, Jackie you're going again
Ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like sifting through sand
Ooh, Jackie it slips through your hand
Everyday in your indigo eyes
I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time
Ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh, Jackie what fun you have had
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, hey
