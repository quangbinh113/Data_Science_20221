Song Name: I'm in a Hurry (And Don't Know Why)
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
Even I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Don't know why? I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2, oh
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll, and I'm ready to rock
Oh, I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die (all I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Oh, I hear a voice
That says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't
No room for someone in second place
Tu-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die, but
I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done (I don't know why)
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die (all I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die (all I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?
