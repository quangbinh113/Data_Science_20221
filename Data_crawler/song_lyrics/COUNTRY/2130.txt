Song Name: Honky Tonk Roll
I got a jackhammer in my head
I got my boots on in my bed
Been burnin' both ends of the bar
With a busted-up heart
And a memory I just can't forget
I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Whole lotta neon in my Lucchese soul
Well, I've been drinkin' my ass off
All the way to last call
Two-stepping out the door
With a sawdust honey
That spent all my money
On a night where anything goes
It ain't hard to tell I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
I got a buzz down to my toes
Hittin' bullseyes with my eyes closed
Just met a girl that likes trouble
And the concho on my buckle
And the smell of smoke on my clothes
I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Whole lotta neon in my Lucchese soul
Well, I've been drinkin' my ass off
All the way to last call
Two-stepping out the door
With a sawdust honey
That spent all my money
On a night where anything goes
It ain't hard to tell I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Roll on!
Whoa, I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Whole lotta neon in my Lucchese soul
Oh, I've been drinkin' my ass off
All the way to last call
Two-stepping out the door
Well, you can cuss me, you can judge me
You can hate me, you can love me
You can say I'm out of control
Yeah, but I don't give a damn
I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Oh, I said I don't give a damn
I'm on a hell of a honky tonk roll
Oh, roll on, boys!
