Song Name: In His Arms
I've seen El Paso when the sky was on fire
Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times
Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high
I wish I was in his arms tonight
I've been a rolling stone, a tumbleweed
Waiting for the right one to come find me
But the wrong one always set me free
I wish I was in his arms tonight
Is he busy playing in some house band in Dallas?
Is he breaking horses in San Antone?
Is he all alone in the neon light?
I wish I was in his arms tonight
Is he praying for rain out in West Texas?
Is he lost in the Marfa lights?
Is he out there looking for me?
Wishing I was in his arms tonight
I wish I was in his arms tonight
You sure do play some pretty, pretty chords
Why thank you neighbor
Look at that star, can you even believe it?
