Song Name: Black
The moon outside, too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed
You know my hands, they know where to go
To find your fingertips, trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doin' that, that thing you're doin' there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

Like your dress on the floor
Yeah, the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms
And make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doin' that, that thing you're doin' there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black
I don't wanna see a thing
Baby, I just wanna feel your touch
Feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your love
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doin' that, that thing you're doin' there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black
Make my world go (black)
I don't wanna see a thing (Black)
I just wanna feel your touch
Feel your rush (Black)
(Black)
