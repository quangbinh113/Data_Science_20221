Song Name: Things A Man Oughta Know
I can hook a trailer on a two-inch hitch
I can shoot a shotgun, I can catch a fish
I can change a tire on the side of a road
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
How to know when it's love
How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing
And how to fix it 'fore it's too late
And yeah, I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman, you don't let her go
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
If I can't have it, I can do without
I can hang a picture same as I can take it down
And how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
How to know when it's love
How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing
And how to fix it 'fore it's too late
And yeah, I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman, you don't let her go
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
How to know when it's love
How to stay when it's tough
How to chase forever down a driveway
How to never let it get there in the first place
And yeah, I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman, you don't let her go
Well, I know a few things a man oughta know
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
