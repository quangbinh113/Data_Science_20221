Song Name: Remind Me (with Carrie Underwood)
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't wanna settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long bet you forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me
Remind me
So on fire and so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me
Remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off?
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad 'cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be?
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
Remind me
Baby remind me
Oh
So on fire and so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me
Baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Ah if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
Oh baby remind me
Remind me
Yeah
Oh do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves?
Remind me
Yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me
Oh baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old T-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me
Oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me
Baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old T-shirt (Remind me yeah)
Oh
Baby remind me
Do you ever spend a weekend on the water?
Drinking beer
Do you drive somewhere like Myrtle Beach or Padre Island?
Every year
