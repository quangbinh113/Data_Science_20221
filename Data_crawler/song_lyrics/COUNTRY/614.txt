Song Name: I Left Something Turned On At Home
Well boys I hate to leave good company
But my baby just called me on the phone
And from the sound of her voice, I simply have no choice
I left something turned on at home
Well I just put a quarter in the jukebox
And it ain't halfway through my favorite song
But if I don't leave right now my whole place might burn down
'Cause I left something turned on at home
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open, the house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left something turned on at home
Hey waitress could you cancel that order
But if its too late I'll take it to go
Boys I gotta run 'fore somebody calls 911
'Cause I left something turned on at home
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open, the house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left something turned on at home
Right now her arms are open, the house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left something turned on at home
Yeah I left something turned on at home
