Song Name: Baby I Am
I could tell somebody broke your heart
I could see somebody told you lies
You ain't even gotta say the words
I can hear 'em looking in your eyes
You can live behind the walls you built
And never look for love again
You can just let me in
Baby I, baby I am
Fallin' even deeper in love
With every single kiss from your lips you're driving me crazy
Every time you touch me
Baby I, baby I know
You're the only one that I need
And if you wonder if I'ma be a love you 'til the day I die kinda man
Baby I, baby I am
Whoa
Whoa
We can call it anything you want
We can fly or we can take this slow
Long as you're here holdin' my hand
Then I know all I need to know
Whoa
Baby I, baby I am
Fallin' even deeper in love
With every single kiss from your lips you're driving me crazy
Every time you touch me
Baby I, baby I know
You're the only one that I need
And if you wonder if I'ma be a love you 'til the day I die kinda man
Baby I, baby I am
Baby I, baby I am
Fallin' even deeper in love
With every single kiss from your lips your driving me crazy
Every time you touch me
Baby I, baby I know
You're the only one that I need
And if you wonder if I'ma be a love you 'til the day I die kinda man
Baby I, baby I am
Whoa
Baby I am
