Song Name: Night Shift
It's been a wreck-me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Bustin' it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day till I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets
And you and me
Workin' on the night shift, baby
Dyin' for your touch like crazy
Rackin' up the overtime hours
Lovin' how we're workin' on the night shift, baby
Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are
Workin' on the night shift, baby
Dyin' for your touch like crazy
Rackin' up the overtime hours
Lovin' how we're workin' on the night shift, baby
Yeah
Yeah
It's been a wreck-me week
Oh, but who needs sleep?
When you're workin' on the night shift, baby
Dyin' for your touch like crazy
Rackin' up the overtime hours
Lovin' how we're workin' on the night shift, baby
Lovin' how we're workin' on the night shift
Lovin' how we're workin' on the night shift
Workin' on the night shift, baby
Yeah
