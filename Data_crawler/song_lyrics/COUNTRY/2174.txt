Song Name: Antioch
His eyes are bloodshot
He's loaded and locked
Thumbing through Revelation down at Antioch
Can't call the law 'cause the sheriff is his kin
And there'll be hell to pay when he comes stumblin' in
Leave it alone
'Cause Mama don't cry when daddy's gone
He used to beat her real good
I could hear the screams and yells
And that ain't somethin you can fix with J-B Weld
I hate him so much even though I bear his name
I can't take him right now but one day that's gonna change
When I get grown
'Cause Mama don't cry when daddy's gone
Hide the bruises and hide the scars
Hide your tears hide who you are
Smile for the camera and pretend it's a happy home
I got in a little trouble on the day I turned sixteen
Got busted stealing cars at the Dairy Queen
They say I'm a product of my raising
Now I'm working for Uncle Sam
But how am I gonna be all I can be when I don't know who I am
And I'm all alone
'Cause Mama don't cry when daddy's gone
I'm getting stronger, I'm getting mean
I 'm learning about killing, I'm learning about me
I'm learning to survive out here in the sand
I'm thinking about Mama, I'm thinking about recompense
So I carry on
'Cause Mama don't cry when daddy's gone
Let the rain wash the blood away
Is the blood of the lamb really enough to save
Someone like me with everything I've done wrong
They got me in Coffield
I'm locked up tight
Guess I had a little blood lust from the Fullajuh nights
I'm trapped in the wreckage, standing in the flames
Wrapped up in something that was never gonna change
But then I came home
Now Mama don't cry that daddy's gone
Then I came home
Now Mama don't cry that daddy's gone
(Now daddy's gone)
