Song Name: Honky Tonk Christmas
Pretty Paper is playing on the jukebox
And mistletoe is hanging above the bar
I wanna thank you for this broken heart that I've got
Merry Christmas, girl
Wherever in the world you are
It's gonna be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve
Blue Christmas turn it up, I wanna hear it
So I can unwrap all the memories in my mind
Hey Joe, pour me some Christmas spirit
If I make it through December, I'll be fine
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve
Yeah, I'll be over you by New Year's Eve
