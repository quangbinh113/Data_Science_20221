Song Name: Man! I Feel Like A Woman!
Let's go girls
C'mon
I'm goin' out tonight, I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise, really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout, uh
No inhibitions, make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time
The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free, yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man, I feel like a woman (Hey!)
The girls need a break, tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance, we only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down
The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free, yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man, I feel like a woman
Uh, huh
Oh, yeah
The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun, fun, fun
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free yeah, to feel the way I feel
(The way I feel)
Man, I feel like a woman
Hey!
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Act totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman
