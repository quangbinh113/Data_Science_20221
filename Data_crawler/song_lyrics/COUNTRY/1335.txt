Song Name: Make You Rich
Well maybe it's because of where I'm from
Ain't nobody living in a high rise
I go to work early with the rising sun
And say a little prayer when I close my eyes
Amen
When I think back when the way I was raised and the way I think
A man isn't measured by more than a treasure stacked up in the bank
Be a better man than your old man was
Give a damn when nobody else does
Love your woman like you're paid to
Like you ain't afraid to
Like she was made for you
And be a good friend when a good friend needs you
Have a little faith when no one believes it
When it comes to love I'll tell you this
You gotta give it like the giving's gonna make you rich
The more I look around the world these days
The more and more I'm sure now
We'd be better off if we all were raised
Down an old two-lane and a three church town
Amen
I remember back when the day I was heading up to Tennessee
We all joined hands by my beat up and they prayed this prayer for me
Be a better man than your old man was
Give a damn when nobody else does
Love your woman like you're paid to
Like you ain't afraid to
Like she was made for you
And be a good friend when a good friend needs you
Have a little faith when no one believes it
When it comes to love I'll tell you this
You gotta give it like the giving's gonna make you rich
Be a better man than your old man was
Give a damn when nobody else does
Love your people like you're paid to
Like you ain't afraid to
Like you were made to do
Do a little good for no good reason
Read a good book when your soul needs freedom
When it comes to love they taught me this
Boy never forget
When it comes to love I'll tell you this
You gotta give it like the giving's gonna make you rich
Like the giving's gonna make you rich
Yeah
