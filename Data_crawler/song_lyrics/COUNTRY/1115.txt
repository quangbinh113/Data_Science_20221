Song Name: Song of the Summer
I knew every street, every red light
But I still got lost staring in her eyes
They were Carolina blue
We turned it up when that song came on
She knew every word by heart
We were singing along in the dark
To that song of the summer
Driving around with the windows down
I'll never forget her
That shotgun smile every midnight mile
Had her hands on me, working over time
Making it hard to stay between the lines
Back when it was just you and I
And that song of the summer
(Ooh)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
We danced, we laughed until we cried
But those three months, man they flew on by
A little bit too fast
Just like that playlist we moved on
Now all that I got left
Is a memory I won't forget
And that song of the summer
Driving around with the windows down
I'll never forget her
That shotgun smile every midnight mile
Had her hands on me, working over time
Making it hard to stay between the lines
Back when it was just you and I
And that song of the summer
(Ooh)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
(Yeah)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
I could still remember that
Song of the summer
Driving around with the windows down
I'll never forget her
That shotgun smile every midnight mile
Had her hands on me, working over time
Making it hard to stay between the lines
Back when it was just you and I
And that song of the summer
(Ooh)
I could still remember that
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
Song of the summer
(Ooh)
