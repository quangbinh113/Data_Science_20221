Song Name: Suds in the Bucket
She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Her folks should've seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door, "Sorry, but I got to go"
And that was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
So the story goes
Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
Now don't you wonder what the preacher's
Gonna preach about Sunday morn?
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker
Smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
'Cause you can't fence time, and you can't stop love
Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop gossip going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
Yoo-hoo!
She's got her pretty little bare feet hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
And no, you can't fence time
And you can't stop love
