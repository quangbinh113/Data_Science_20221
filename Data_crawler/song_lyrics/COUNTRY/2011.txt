Song Name: Some Other Bar
Ooh, you know the funny little thing about us
Is that we're only here as long as the wind
And hey it might never happen again
But if it does
Then girl I knew
From the second that you walked in
That goodbye was just the beginning of me wishing on a midnight star
That I'll see you
At some other bar, some other Friday
At a hole in the wall, right by the highway
Or down by the water, you'll come around
Out of the blue baby, it's going down
And I know when the whiskey pours
You know I'ma turn around and watch that door
Waiting to finish, what we didn't even get to start
Someday at some other bar
Ooh, at some other bar
Ooh, I'll have a Casamigos waiting on you
I'll throw my jacket on the back of the stool beside me
And you can find me, as soon as you walk in
And it was nothing but a midnight flame, but it's burning
Slow like an old coal train, don't worry
Baby go and do your thing
We'll pick it back up real soon someday
At some other bar, some other Friday
At a hole in the wall, right by the highway
Or down by the water, you'll come around
Out of the blue baby, it's going down
And I know when the whiskey pours
You know I'ma turn around and watch that door
Waiting to finish, what we didn't even get to start
Someday at some other bar
Ooh, at some other bar
Some other night, in a Tin Roof town
I'll be stealing kisses, in a whole new crowd
It ain't over, it's just over for now
Hold me to it girl, I owe you a round
At some other bar, some other Friday
At a hole in the wall, right by the highway
Or down by the water, you'll come around
Out of the blue baby, it's going down
At some other bar, some other Friday
At a hole in the wall, right by the highway
Or down by the water, you'll come around
Out of the blue baby, it's going down
And I know when the whiskey pours
You know Imma turn around and watch that door
Waiting to finish, what we didn't even get to start
Someday at some other bar
Someday at some other bar
Ah, some other bar
