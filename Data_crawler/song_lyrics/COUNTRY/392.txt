Song Name: Born to Fly
I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I say, friend, do you think I'll ever get there
Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me
So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
Is there a brown-eyed boy in my future, yeah
And he says, girl, you've got nothin' but time
But how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know that you were born
You were born to fly
My daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree
My mama, she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I wander wild and free
Oh, how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know that you were born
You were born, yeah
You were born to fly
So how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know that you were born
You were born to fly
Yeah
You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly
Hey
Whoo oou
