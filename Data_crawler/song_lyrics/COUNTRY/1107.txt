Song Name: Back Then, Right Now
Brown bag bottle and a burnt CD
Turn it up, John Deere Green
Hilltop sittin' over Friday night lights
Tailgate sippin', little dipper on bright
I'm slow ridin' down a throwback road
Time keeps flyin'
Where'd the good old days go?
I could use a little cold can, full moon
I could sing a little map dot, hallelujah
I could use a little back to my roots
That's the truth
I could really use a little down home slowdown
A little bit of look back on how
The whole wide world was one small town
I could use a little back then right now
Ridin' up and down main in a Pontiac
DQ cone, seats leaned back
It all went by in a flash of Kodak
Ain't nothin' that I wouldn't give to get that back
Come on take me back 'cause
I could use a little cold can, full moon
I could sing a little map dot, hallelujah
I could use a little back to my roots
That's the truth
I could really use a little down home slowdown
A little bit of look back on how
The whole wide world was one small town
I could use a little back then right now
I could use a little, I could use a little, I could use a little
Back then right now
I could use a little, I could use a little, I could use a little
I could really use a little turn homeward bound
A little bit of been lost, get found
A little bit of y'all come back 'round
A little bit of back then right now
I could use a little cold can, full moon
I could sing a little map dot, hallelujah
I could use a little back to my roots
That's the truth
I could really use a little down home slowdown
A little bit of look back on how
The whole wide world was one small town
I could use a little back then right now
I could use a little, I could use a little, I could use a little
Back then right now
I could use a little, I could use a little, I could use a little
Back then right now
I could use a little, I could use a little, I could use a little
Back then right now
