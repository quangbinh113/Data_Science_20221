Song Name: Country On
Hey, farmboy, keep droppin' that plow
Bailin' that hay, feedin' them cows
From the rooster crow 'til another long day is gone
Country on
Hey big rig, keep clockin' them miles
Pullin' that horn, makin' us smile
Rollin' that load down the road all night long
Country on
Hey cowboy, keep slingin' that rope
Eatin' that dirt, wearing that gold
Break a leg rodeo, but just don't break no bones
Country on
Hey barkeep, how 'bout another round?
Keep the neon lit in this crazy town
Just pour a little more
Country on
Country on
Yeah
Country on
Hey fireman, boys and girls in blue
We could sure use a lot more like you
You come runnin' in anytime, anything goes wrong
Country on
Hey soldier, wherever you might bе
Hats off to keepin' us free
All our thoughts and prayers 'til you get back home
Country on
Hеy hometown, keep throwing that ball
Raise 'em outside, hang a fish on the wall
They only stay little so long, so love 'em up strong
Country on
I say, "Hey, hey, USA
We ain't seen our better days"
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on
Country on
Hey Nashville, keep bending them strings
Diggin' for gold, chasin' them dreams
Keep on with your songs 'til the whole worlds singin' along
Country on
I say, "Hey, hey USA
We ain't seen our better days"
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on
Country on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on and on
Country on (oh, country on)
Keep keepin' on and on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on and on
Country on
Yeah, country on
Woo
Yeah, country on and on and on
On and on
Keep puttin' that country on
Country on
Country on and on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on
Country on and on and on and on and on and on
