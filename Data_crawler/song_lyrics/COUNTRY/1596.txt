Song Name: If I Needed You
If I needed you
Would you come to me?
Would you come to me?
And ease my pain?
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
In the night forlorn
Oh the morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love
And you will miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
That would break
My heart in two
The lady's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay her lily
Hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree
She's a sight to see
A treasure for
The poor to find
If I needed you
Would you come to me?
Would you come to me?
And ease my pain?
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
