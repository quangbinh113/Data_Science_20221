Song Name: 30 Thousand Feet (I Ain't)
Hey, it's me, uhh
I'm really sorry, but I can't do this anymore
Umm, I wish you the best
First class seat on a one way flight
You can keep 'em hometown lights
All the memories of you and me fadin' outta sight
Once these wings took off tonight
I thought that I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't
I swore that I could leave behind the heartache
But you found your way
Into my mind
Even when I'm 30 thousand feet up in the sky
Lookin' out the window of this plane
Thought I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, no, I ain't
I thought the distance could do the trick
Just like that you'd be somebody I don't miss
No matter how far I get there's always one more perfect sunset I wish you could see
But honestly
I thought that I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't
I swore that I could leave behind the heartache
But you found your way
Into my mind
Even when I'm 30 thousand feet up in the sky
Lookin' out the window of this plane
Thought I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, no I ain't
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh
You're down there somewhere
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Don't know why I still care
I thought that I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't
I swore that I could leave behind the heartache
But you found your way
Into my mind
Even when I'm 30 thousand feet up in the sky
Lookin' out the window of this plane
Thought I'd be over you, but I ain't
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, no, I ain't
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
