Song Name: Wine, Beer, Whiskey
My friend named Jack
He's got my back
He always seems to know right where I'm at
My friend Jose
He likes to play
He's always up for anything I say
Little bit of red, lotta bit of crown
Don't matter what it is
I'm gonna drink it down, down, down
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not saying it's a problem
I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
My friend named Gin
She's got some friends
I'm talking Brandy, Sherry, and their brother Jim
My friend, the Captain
We call him Morgan
He likes to anchor down and hang over 'til mornin'
Little bit of red, lotta bit of white
Don't matter what it is
It's gonna make it all alright
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not saying it's a problem
I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
My friend named Tito
He's my amigo
I'm gonna follow him around wherever he go
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Yeah, I got all my friends here with me
I'm not saying it's a problem
I can stop it if I wanna
But who would wanna?
When the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
They always get me
They always get me
Yeah, they always get me
