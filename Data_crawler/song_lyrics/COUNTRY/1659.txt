Song Name: Problem With It
I drift out further away
I got a problem with it and I don't know how to say
It's a pink carnation, it's a hand hastily played
The potboiler wearing out
Give 'em something to kick up dust about
If it was love you were after with a long shadow of doubt
If it's all you got, yeah, it's all you gave
I got a problem with it
If you can't do better than that, babe
I got a problem with it
Justified it in my own way
I lost myself in it
If it's all you got and it's enough, you say
I got a problem with it

I drive fast on high alert
Pass the Jet-Pep and the baptist church
On the county line, I'll be a songbird softly heard
My loose change falling out
Got a heartbreak burn, take the quickest route
On this four-lanе highway, I'll trace it in the clouds
If it's all you got, yeah, it's all you gavе
I got a problem with it
If you can't do better than that, babe
I got a problem with it
Justified it in my own way
I lost myself in it
If it's all you got and it's enough, you say
I got a problem with it!
If it's all you got, yeah, it's all you gave
I got a problem with it
If you can't do better than that, babe
I got a problem with it
Justified it in my own way
I lost myself in it
If it's all you got and it's enough, you say
I got a problem with it
