Song Name: Phones Don't Work
Maybe Montana, hell, I don't know
South Louisiana, way off the coast
An Arizona desert
Where I can stay high
Find myself, lose my mind
I don't know how many miles it's gonna take
All I know is I ain't hitting no brakes
'Til I'm way past the place where it don't hurt
Where she can't call me
And I can't call her
Hell, I don't care
Anywhere phones don't work
Where I can't see her picture
I can't hear her voice
And even if I wanted to, I ain't got a choice
That satellite signal is just outta reach
And she can't get to me
I don't know how many miles it's gonna take
All I know is I ain't hitting no brakes
'Til I'm way past the place where it don't hurt
Where she can't call me
And I can't call her
Hell, I don't care
Anywhere phones don't work
Where there's only static on the radio waves
Yeah, I gotta get that far away
I don't know how many miles it's gonna take
All I know is I ain't hitting no brakes
'Til I'm way past the place where it don't hurt
She can't call me
I don't know how many miles it's gonna take
All I know is I ain't hitting no brakes
'Til I'm way past the place where it don't hurt
Where she can't call me
And I can't call her
Hell, I don't care
Anywhere phones don't work
Yeah, anywhere phones don't work
