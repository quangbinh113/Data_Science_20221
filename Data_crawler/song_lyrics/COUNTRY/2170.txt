Song Name: Haunted House
I pace these halls
And you can see right through me
I'm not there at all
An even where I should be
And all these pictures on the walls of us
Of what we used to be
Could've fooled me
Could've fooled me
And I'm trying to find to words to say
To make you go away
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I'm trying
To get out but I wind up in the same place
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I tried to be the man you wanted
Tell me that this house ain't haunted
She's like a curse
The way she follows me around
And I haven't told her yet what we have's six feet underground
And the silence is deafening,
I just can't find what's left of me and you
Well it's true, yeah it's true
And I'm trying to find to words to say
To make you go away
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I'm trying
To get out but I wind up in the same place
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I tried to be the man you wanted
Tell me that this house ain't haunted
I hear screams and slamming doors
Taps on glass and creaking floors
Paranoia's setting in
Was it you or just the wind
And I'm trying to find to words to say
To make you go away
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I'm trying
To get out but I wind up in the same place
But you stay, yeah you stay
And I tried to be the man you wanted
Tell me that this house ain't haunted
Won't you tell me that this house ain't haunted
Well tell me that this, tell me that this
Tell me that this house ain't haunted
Won't you tell me that this house ain't haunted
