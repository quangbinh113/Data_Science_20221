Song Name: Somebody Like That - Acoustic
I've seen pickup lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour two-for-ones turn to one-night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairy tale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, it might take a while
But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart, open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
I still remember momma walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile, "That's my girl right there"
They have their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work, and the worth it
To get to that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart, open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not
And I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart, open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Hmm, somebody like that
Hmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that
