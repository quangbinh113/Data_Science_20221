Song Name: Over Her Over Here
I had a feeling this would happen (happen)
When I heard she broke up with you (up with you)
So, I don't know why you're acting (acting)
Like you're calling out of the blue
Say you wanna talk, but I don't wanna listen
'Cause I know you're lying
So, if you're driving around on my side of town
Baby, just keep driving
Did you call me 'cause she told you she don't love you anymore?
Didn't anybody tell you, baby, that's what wishey's for?
The only thing you should be holding tonight is a drink at a bar and a Marlboro light
You can dry your own damn tears
Go get over her
But you can't get over her over here
When you broke my heart
It broke my heart, how fast you moved on (how fast you movеd on)
And baby, I don't doubt, you're missing me now
But it's only 'cause shе's gone
Did you call me 'cause she told you she don't love you anymore?
Didn't anybody tell you, baby, that's what wishey's for?
The only thing you should be holding tonight is a drink at a bar and a Marlboro light
You can dry your own damn tears
Go get over her
But you can't get over her over here
Can't believe you had the nerve to call me after all this time (after all this time)
Hey, you made your bed, what makes you think that you can sleep in mine?
Did you call me 'cause she told you she don't love you anymore?
Didn't anybody tell you, baby, that's what wishey's for?
The only thing you should be holding tonight is a drink at a bar and a Marlboro light
You can dry your own damn tears
Go get over her
But you can't get over her over here
Here
You can't get over her over here
Oh-oh
You can't get over her over here
