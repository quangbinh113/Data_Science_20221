Song Name: Way Down Yonder
Up in the hills
Where coppers don't crack down on them copper steels
We're making trap door tax-free dollar bills
Up in the highway biz
Not his way to make a living
Six-shot heavy metal hanging from a holster
In case we run into them boys from the county line over
Way down yonder, where the outlaws wander
You can feel that thunder in your bones
Ripping under moonlight cover
There's some back glass gunners on the road
Where you buy your bud with the moonshine money
Make your love where thе bees make honey
Way on the cuts, whеre you're born and raised
Man, it's in your blood, we were born this way
Down yonder, way down
Way down, way down
Way down yonder
You can't fold
A bunch of bootleg birdies and their bandit boys
On some outpost wanted for some polaroid
Sayin', "Dead or alive," goin' eighty-five
Way down yonder, where the outlaws wander
You can feel that thunder in your bones
Ripping under moonlight cover
There's some bback glass gunners on the road
Where you buy your bud with the moonshine money
Make your love where the bees make honey
Way on the cuts, where you're born and raised
Man, it's in your blood, we were born this way
Down yonder, way down
Way down, way down
Way down yonder
Way down, way down, way down
Way down yonder
And someway between the hooves and hellraising
You'll be saving
Way down yonder, where the outlaws wander
You can feel that thunder in your bones
Ripping under moonlight cover
There's some backglass gunners on the road
Where you buy your bud with the moonshine money
Make your love where the bees make honey
Way on the cuts, where you're born and raised
Man, it's in your blood, we were born this way
Way down yonder, way down
Way down, way down
Way down yonder
Way down, way down, way down
Way down yonder
Way down yonder
