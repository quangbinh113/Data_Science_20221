Song Name: Raisin' Me A Country Girl
Yeah she's gonna have a Barbie jeep
But she's gonna get it stuck in the creek
With her dog named Dolly in the passenger seat
With some red clay mud on her little bare feet
She'll have pink painted on her toes
While she's drinkin' from the water hose
Growin' up where the sweet corn grows
With her Sunday school down the road
'Cause I'm raisin' me a country girl
Don't be fooled by her golden curls
She's sweet as sugar but tough as nails
Lovin' her daddy but givin' boys hell
She didn't fall far from the tree
Every day you'll see a little more me
Yeah I'm on my knees every night prayin'
Thankin' God I'm raisin' me a country girl
Oooh-ooh
Raisin' me a country girl
Ooh-ooh
She'll pick her own berries on the farm
And want her a pony in a barn
She'll watch huntin' shows and love football
And call her grandaddy Pawpaw
'Cause I'm raisin' me a country girl
Don't be fooled by her golden curls
She's sweet as sugar but tough as nails
Lovin' her daddy but giving boys hell
She didn't fall far from the tree
Every day I see a little more me
Yeah I'm on my knees every night prayin'
Thankin' God I'm raisin' me a country girl
Ooh-ooh
Raisin' me a country girl
Ooh-ooh
Yeah she's pretty as a picture in her summer dress
She ain't scared of dirt and loves to fish
(Aw, shoot)
Yeah I'm raisin' me a country girl
Don't be fooled by her golden curls
She's sweet as sugar but tough as nails
Lovin' her daddy but giving boys hell
She didn't fall far from the tree
Every day I see a little more me
Yeah I'm on my knees every night prayin'
Thankin' God I'm raisin' me a country girl
Ooh-ooh
Raisin' me a country girl
Ooh-ooh
I'm raisin' me a country girl
