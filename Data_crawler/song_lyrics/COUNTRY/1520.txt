Song Name: Leave Me My Heart
Staring' at these walls
Painted a hundred shades of you
Yeah girl it just reminds me
Of how you could never choose
This ain't the first time you've tried
Yeah walking' out on me
Last time i locked the door and wouldn't let you in
But now what's done is done
And this is how it's gonna be
Just take my car
So you can take your ass
Take my guitars and my last glass
Of whiskey, so i just can't drown your memory
Take all my shit
Leave me my heart
Every day is a brand new hell
You always know how to hide your horns
And i wish when i locked that door
I would've met you with flames
We're at the crossroads now and this is all i've got to say
Just take my car
So you can take your ass
Take my guitar and my last glass
Of whiskey, so i just can't drown your memory
Take all my shit
But leave me my heart
Just take my car
So you can take your ass
Take my guitars and my last glass
Of whiskey, so i just cant drown your memory
Take all my shit
But leave me my heart
My heart
