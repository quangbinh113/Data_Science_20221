Song Name: American Country Love Song
It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush t-shirt
Wonderin' who's gonna kiss who first
You know what I'm talkin about
Hey, baby, what you doin' tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes of a
Beach towel in a Spring Break town
It's playin' in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin' that American country love song
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to runaway with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for luck
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on
Well, it's "Chris loves Jenny" on a license plate
It's daddy gettin' mad 'cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey radio DJ, can you play that song that she loves?
So I can turn it up, and maybe turn her on
An American country love song
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's tryin to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for luck
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on
So let's raise a glass
Cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls all around this small town world
To the same old pickup lines we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets till the ones that you ain't met yet
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's tryin to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't never gonna be plain' on and on and on
