Song Name: This One's for the Girls
This is for all you girls about thirteen
High school can be so rough, can be so mean
Hold onto, onto your innocence
Stand your ground when everyone's giving in
This one's for the girls
This is for all you girls about twenty-five
In little apartments, just trying to get by
Living on, on dreams and spaghetti-o's
Wondering where your life is gonna go
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls
This is for all you girls about forty-two
Tossing pennies into The Fountain of Youth
Every laugh, laugh line on your face
Made you who you are today
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls
Yeah, we're all the same inside (same inside)
From to
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world, yeah
This one's for the girls
(This one's for all the girls)
Yeah, this one's for the girls
(This one's for all the girls)
