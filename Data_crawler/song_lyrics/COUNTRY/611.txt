Song Name: How Can I Help You Say Goodbye
Through the back window of our '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on wavin' till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again, "Why we couldn't stay"
Mama whispered softly
"Time will ease your pain
Life's about changin'
Nothin' ever stays the same"
And she said, "How can I help you
To say goodbye, it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye"
I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were cryin'
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up mama and she said
"Time will ease your pain
Life's about changin'
Nothin' ever stays the same"
And she said, "How can I help you
To say goodbye, it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye"
Sittin' with Mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said, "I have to go now my time here is over"
And with her final words, she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly
"Time will ease your pain
Life's about changin'
Nothin' ever stays the same"
And she said, "How can I help you
To say goodbye, it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye"
