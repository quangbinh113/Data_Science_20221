Song Name: West Texas in My Eye
Lately I've been thinking that I could leave this town
I'd cut back on my drinking, stop this running 'round
Playing songs 'til after midnight, staying up till dawn
There's something in the dust and wind that keeps me hanging on
And I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd say "goodbye"
I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye
I'll be your blue eyed bandit if you'll be my renegade
I count a thousand tumbleweeds roll by me everyday
I'd like to grow a rose and stow it in that desert sage
Like a message in a bottle floating down the open plains
Where the llano estacado rises up to meet the sky
I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye
I've seen the thunderheads descend and rip into the ground
The twisted hand of heaven spreading terror all around
Sending farmers into deeper debt and ranchers to the grave
Where towers mark the end of time with slowly spinning blades
'Til the water table falls below the reach of humankind
I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye
Lately I've been thinking, I could leave this town
Cut back on my drinking, stop this running around
Playing songs 'til after midnight, and staying up till dawn
But there's something in the dust and wind that keeps me hanging on
And I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd say "goodbye"
I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye
I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye
