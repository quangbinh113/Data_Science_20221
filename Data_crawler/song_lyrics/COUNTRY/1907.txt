Song Name: Can't Do Without Me
Since I clocked in at eight I've been waiting on five
Boy, I've been dreaming all day thinking 'bout tonight
And I can't wait to hear you walk right through that door
And I can't wait to see that dress spend the night on the floor
Baby, I'm dying to catch that lighting I only find from your fingertips
I've been missing and wishing to feel your kiss
And your hands all on my skin
It won't be long 'til we are burning up 'em sheets
And doing all those things that you can't do without me
Oh, I can start a fire right now and pour a little red wine
Oh, and I can push this pedal on down and run every red light
I'm going out of my mind
Baby, I'm dying to catch that lighting I only find from your fingertips
I've been missing and wishing to feel your kiss
And your hands all on my skin
It won't be long 'til we are burning up 'em them sheets
And doing all those things that you can't do without me
Oh, no, that you can't do without me
That you can't do without me
Whose gonna send them chills running down your back?
Whose gonna turn you on when the lights go black?
You know you're the only one that do me like that
I'm here going crazy
I'm on my way baby
Baby, I'm dying to catch that lighting
I only find from your fingertips
I've been missing and wishing to feel your kiss
And your hands all on my skin
It won't be long 'til we are burning up 'em them sheets
And doing all those things that you can't do without me
Oh, no, that you can't do without me
That you can't do without me
