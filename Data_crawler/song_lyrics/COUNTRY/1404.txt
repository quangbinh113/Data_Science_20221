Song Name: The Nicest Thing
Could've avoided it all
Every tear running down my cheek didn't have to fall
Head strong love heart first right into the wall
Now we got all these memories
Hurt so bad to think we could've avoided it all
Ooh, oh-oh
The nicest thing you ever could've done was just keep walking
Could've stayed two strangers, watch you mess it up with talking
Seen my face and you let it go
Just another name that you'll never know
The nicest thing you ever could've done for me was never said hello
You had me feeling so high
Like a bottle rocket out of your head
Yeah, I thought I could fly
But you don't think about the cold hard ground
When you're touching the sky
Top of the world, crashes and burns
Guess that's how it works
You had me feeling so high
Ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The nicest thing you ever could've done was just keep walking
Could've stayed two strangers, watch you mess it up with talking
Seen my face and you let it go
Just another name that you'll never know
The nicest thing you ever could've done for me was never said hello, o-o-o
(The nicest thing, the nicest thing)
Hello, o-o-o
(The nicest thing, the nicest thing)
If, who am I to do again?
I'd leave you standing there instead
I'd walk away with no regrets, with no regrets
The nicest thing you ever could've done was just keep walking
Could've stayed two strangers, watch you mess it up with talking
Seen my face and you let it go
Just another name that you'll never know
The nicest thing you ever could've done for me was never said hello, o-o-o
(The nicest thing, the nicest thing)
Hello, o-o-o
(The nicest thing, the nicest thing)
