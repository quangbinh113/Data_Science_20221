Song Name: Thank God
I was lost
You found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness
You always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love
'Cause you don't be giving up
And it's crazy
How you saved me
Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for
So, thank God
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do, and he knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God
Thank God for giving me you
Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Who made a change to everything
From my heart to my last name
Hey, hard to tell
When he fell
That boy was Heaven sent
And every night
When I close my eyes
Before I say amen
I thank God
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do, and he knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God
Thank God, (yeah, yeah)
Thank God, (oh)
Hand on the bible
Don't know how I got you
I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for
So, thank God
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do and, he knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God, thank God
Thank God, yeah, yeah
Thank God
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God (oh, oh)
Yeah, thank God
Oh, thank God
Thank God for giving me you
