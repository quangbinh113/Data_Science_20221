Song Name: Boys Back Home
The boys back home ain't more than a stone's
Throw from a six-pack, pinch of Wintergreen Skoal
They ain't scared of nothin' except for your brothers
They walk like their daddies, marry girls like their mothers
And their dreams are Carhartt and Chrome, the boys back home
They drive me around on those Friday nights
And they taught me to drink, and they taught me to fight
When I think about all of the men that I've known
There ain't none like the boys back home
They wear worn-out boots, they take off their hats
For suppers and sermons, funerals and flags
They'll bail you out of a ditch or a bar
And they won't be caught dead in no electric car
'Cause it's all sure rock roads for the boys back home
They drive me around on those Friday nights
And they taught me to kiss, and they taught me to cry
When I think about all of the men that I've known
There ain't none like the boys back home
Well, I left that town, and we all grew up
But sometimes I still miss that girl that I was
When I was a shotgun seat in their trucks
Singin' along to the radio
When they drive me around on those Friday nights
Learned a little 'bout love and a lot about life
And when I think about all of the men that I've known
There ain't none like the boys back home
So, here's one for the boys back home
Yeah, here's one for the boys back home
