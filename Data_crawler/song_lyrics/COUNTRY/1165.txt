Song Name: May We All
May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a one star hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from drivin' a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much
May we all know that nothin' ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down the jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rollin' with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowin' out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't, then you just freefall
May we all
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marchin' band play with the harvest moon comin' up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watchin' the TV the day that it comes
May we all know that nothin' ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down the jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rollin' with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowin' out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't, then you just freefall
May we all
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little somethin' from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hopin' that the best one is the last one
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't, then you just freefall
May we all, may we all, may we all, may we all, may we all
(Get to have a chance to ride the fast one) may we all
(Walk away wiser when we crashed one) may we all
(Keep hoping that the best one is the last one) may we all
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't, then you just freefall
May we all
