Song Name: Gimme Three Steps
I was cuttin' a rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man, with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who
He said hey there fellow, with the hair colored yellow
What'cha tryin' to prove
'Cause that's my woman there, and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you
I said, excuse me
ï¿¼#INSTRUMENTAL
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, an' mean, an' big and bad, Lord
And pointin' that gun at me
Oh, wait a minute mister I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me, but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you
Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister
And you'll never see me no more
For sure
Well the crowd cleared away, and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Starin' straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was a-lookin' for
And you could hear me screamin' a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister
And you'll never see me no more
Show me the back door
