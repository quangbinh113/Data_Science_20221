Song Name: Night Life
Oh, when the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging 'round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Yeah, when the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging 'round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
