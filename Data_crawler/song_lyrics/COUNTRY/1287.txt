Song Name: Waiting For You - Acoustic
There were highs, there were lows
There were stories that I wrote before you
But they all ended up the same, yeah, yeah
I lay in bed, bow my head, didn't know that I was praying for you, hmm
And now I thank God everyday
'Cause I finally found the piece that I been missing all along
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life
Oh, yeah
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life, yeah
Oh, I finally found thе piece that I've been missing all along
Girl, I'vе been waiting for you my whole life
Waiting for you my whole life, yeah
I thought I knew what it was, now I wouldn't call it love before you
'Cause one kiss changed everything, yeah, yeah
And I'm finally done with searching, girl, because your smile is all I need
And your song is all I sing, yeah
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life
Oh, yeah
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I finally found the piece that I've been missing all along
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life
Waiting for you my whole life, yeah
I'd still be walking down this lonely road without you
Just looking for the other part of me, yeah
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life
Girl, I've been waiting for you my whole life, yeah
Oh, I finally found thе piece that I've been missing all along
Girl, I'vе been waiting for you my whole life
Waiting for you my whole life, yeah
Hmmm
Girl I've been waiting for you my whole life, yeah
