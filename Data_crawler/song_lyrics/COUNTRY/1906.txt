Song Name: High
Sometimes I get a little too high
Got my mind going places I don't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shining through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, you're like a rolling stone
Always building cities on the hearts that you broke
And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holding me
And dancing to the record like a movie scene
And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I get a little too high
Got my mind going places I don't wanna go
And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
I still feel high
