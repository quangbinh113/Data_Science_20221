Song Name: Every Time Two Fools Collide
You want things your way
And I want them mine
And now we don't know
Just where you draw the line
How can love survive
If we keep cheers and sights?
And who picks up the pieces
Every time two fools collide?
You lay the blame on me
And I put the balme on you
But why do we keep finding faults
In everything we do?
And how long can we keep righting wrongs
So cut-and-dry
And who picks up the pieces
Every time two fools collide?
We can save our love
We still have the time
Oh, I know there must be a way
But we still haven't tried
To keep our hearts from breaking
Every time two fools collide
To keep our hearts from breaking
Every time two fools collide
