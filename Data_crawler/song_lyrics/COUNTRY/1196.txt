Song Name: American Nights
Blue ribbon bottles, big block throttles
Marlboros if you want 'em
Go on and take a drag
A little small town freedom
A little taste of dreamin'
No need to preach
No need to shout, we believe in
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
Faded Levi's, worn out Chucks
20 in my pocket, feels like a million bucks
Blue-eyed beauty, lean in to me
Our own show in the back row
Miss the whole damn movie
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the morning don't come
These colors don't run
Stay up and stay young
American nights
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the mornin' don't come
Stay up and stay young
