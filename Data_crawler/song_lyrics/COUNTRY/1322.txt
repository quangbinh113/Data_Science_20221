Song Name: Thought This Through
Should've known it would feel like this
Should've known how you fix your hair
Should've known that you do your best to remind me what I miss
Should've known that you wouldn't fight fair
And oh, yeah, I planned out how this moment would go
Girl, I swear
I thought, I thought this through
That I knew what I'd do
Then I saw you walk into this bar with someone new
And I thought I could act
Like I don't want us back
Turns out that after all this time, it's still too soon
I thought, I thought this through, ooh-ooh (thought, I thought this through)
Didn't think it would all rush back
Didn't think you'd be here alone
Didn't think I would hate that you ain't the one payin' my tab
Didn't think this is how it would go
I thought, I thought this through
That I knew what I'd do
Then I saw you walk into this bar with someone new
And I thought I could act
Like I don't want us back
Turns out that after all this time, it's still too soon
I thought, I thought this through, ooh-ooh

I thought, I thought this through
Now I don't know what to do
'Cause I think that I just might still be in love with you
I thought, I thought this through
That I knew what I'd do
Then I saw you walk into this bar with someone new
And I thought I could act
Like I don't want us back
Turns out that after all this time, it's still too soon
I thought, I thought this through, ooh-ooh

(Thought I thought this through, ooh-ooh)
