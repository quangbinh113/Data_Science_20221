Song Name: A Hard Working Man (feat. Billy Ray Cyrus & Snoop Dogg)
I'm a hard workingman, doing all that I can
I'm a Hard workingman, doing all that I can
I worked hard all my life so I'm blessed today
Long Beach California repping USA
Proud American Pop's a Vietnam Veteran
Liberty Justice For All Good Men I Pray
I'm up early for a hard day's work
Seven Days a week nine to Five, I put my hands in the dirt
I know I gotta provide, to keep my family right
Rain or snow, even a hundred degrees outside
Papa told me
You gotta work hard to get your hustle on
Mama told me
You gotta be smart to get what you want
I'm a Hard Working Man
I'm a Hard Working Man
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man get your hustle on
Represent for your city
Represent for your town
Represent for your country
Show 'еm how you get down
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man, doing all that I can
I'm a Hard Working Man, doing all that I can
I gotta get it work hard, I'm with it
Last timе I sat down, good Lord, been a minute
Life long committed I wanna be my own boss
Three sixty-five and no days off
Eyes on the prize taking no loss
Hard work and dedication man It really pays off
One day I was walking down the street
And a little old lady started singing to me
There's a couple of things we all need
Just a little bit of love and some elbow grease
I said elbow grease she said elbow grease
Well can you give some to Doggy Dogg, please
Ladies go hard, you gotta give it up
They can be strong yeah, they can be tough
They're the backbone, when the going gets rough now
Yeah when the going gets rough
New Jersey and Tuscaloo LA, Chi-town, and Atlanta too
Wherever you from this beer's for you
All my hard-working people show 'em how you do
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man
I'm a Hard Working Man
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man
Get your hustle on
Represent for your city
Represent for your town
Represent for your country
Show 'em how you get down
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man
Cause I'm a Hard Working Man
Get your hustle on
I'm a Hard Working Man
I'm a Hard Working Man
