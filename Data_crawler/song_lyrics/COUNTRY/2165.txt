Song Name: Hood of That Car
Sometimes it happens
'Cause a friend has a friend
And sometimes it happens
At the bar at 2 a.m
Oh, but most the time it happens
When you finally stop tryin'
But for you and I, it happened when we finally stopped driving
We were blue jean dreamers
Too young to know hearts
A couple don't-stop-believers
Going 90 in park
You and me, hot and heavy
On the front of that Chevy
Still burnin' from that first-time spark
Yeah, we fooled around and fell in love
On the hood of that car
Used my sweatshirt as a pillow
As we looked up at the stars
When it started getting colder, I just wrapped you in my arms
Said forget about tomorrow
Didn't wanna think that far
(Didn't know it at the moment)
(But we were off to a pretty good start)
We were blue jean dreamers
Too young to know hearts
A couple don't-stop-believers
Going 90 in park
You and me, hot and heavy
On the front of that Chevy
Still burnin' from that first-time spark
Yeah, we fooled around and fell in love
On the hood of that car
We were blue jean dreamers
Too young to know hearts
A couple don't-stop-believers
Going 90 in park
You and me, hot and heavy
On the front of that Chevy
Still burnin' from that first-time spark
We were blue jean dreamers
Too young to know hearts
A couple don't-stop-believers
Going 90 in park
You and me, hot and heavy
On the front of that Chevy
Still burnin' from that first-time spark
Yeah, we fooled around and fell in love
Yeah, we fooled around and fell in love
Yeah, we fooled around and fell in love
On the hood of that car
The hood of that car
