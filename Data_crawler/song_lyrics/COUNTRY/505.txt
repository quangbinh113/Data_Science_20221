Song Name: Write This Down
I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kinda blind
Thought everything was goin' all right
But I was runnin' outta time
'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really goin' away
Here's some final words from me
Baby write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a book mark, stick it on your frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above
The mantle where you'll see it for sure
Baby write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down
You can find the chisel, I can find the stone
Folks'll be a-readin' these words, long after we're gone
Baby write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down
Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby write this down
