Song Name: Last Name
Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!
We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
Well, it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?
And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!
Mmm, today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem
I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah, whoo
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah
