Song Name: Give You My All
Nah, there ain't much in the bank
But, baby, you can have it
I'll put down this drank
And start makin' you the habit
I'll be an open book
Baby, just turn the page
I swear I'll make it worth everything
'Cause I'll give you all of my money and all of my time
Give you all of my days, baby, all of my nights
Tell you all of my secrets and won't let you fall
Girl, I'll give you my
Give you my
Give you my
Give you my all
I's stuck in my ways
'Til you came around
Everybody else got half of me
But who I am now
I would swim across the ocean
Run a million miles
Ain't another man gon' love you like me
'Cause girl I'll give you all of my money and all of my time
Give you all of my days, baby, all of my nights
Tell you all of my secrets and won't let you fall
Girl, I'll give you my
Give you my
Give you my
Give you my all
You're all I got left, baby
Take my last breath
Girl, take my last name
'Cause I'll give you all of my money and all of my time
Give you all of my days, baby, all of my nights
Tell you all of my secrets and won't let you fall
Girl, I'll give you my
Give you my
Give you my
'Cause I'll give you all of my money and all of my time
Give you all of my days, baby, all of my nights
Tell you all of my secrets and won't let you fall
Girl, I'll give you my
Give you my
Give you my
Give you my all
Give you my all, baby
