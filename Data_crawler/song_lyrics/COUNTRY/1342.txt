Song Name: Hating Everything She Tries On
I don't hear no thunder, I don't see no rain
But she's got the bedroom looking like a cat to hurricane
She's looking in the mirror and I'm looking at her
She's cussing underneath her breath
And I ain't saying a word
Probably outta get going, If we're gonna make a reservation
Looks beautiful to me but right now she's
Hatin' everything she tries on
But I don't know what for
Two dresses on the bed
Three more in the floor
She keeps saying "I'm sorry it's taking so long"
She don't know I'm loving watching her
Hatin' everything she tries on
She says "these spaghetti straps I don't like 'em at all"
Slides 'em over off her shoulder
Just lets 'em fall
She keeps looking better with every change she's making
I'm on the edge of this bed smiling, waiting while she's
Hatin' everything she tries on
But I don't know what for
Two dresses on the bed
Four more in the floor
She keeps saying "I'm sorry it's taking so long"
She don't know I'm loving watching her
Hatin' everything she tries on
Aw, but I ain't in no rush
I fall a little more in love
Every time I zip her up
She's hatin' everything she tries on
But I don't know what for
Two dresses on the bed
Five more in the floor
She keeps saying "I'm sorry it's taking so long"
She don't know I'm loving watching her
Hatin' everything she tries on (everything, she's hatin' everything)
Oh, keep trying 'em on baby (everything, she's hatin' everything)
