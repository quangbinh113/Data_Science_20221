Song Name: Short Hills Rd
Swore, I couldn't live another day like that
Desperation makes us do things
Where we let go of the past to find new pains
A woman asked, "Can we guess your name?"
And you don't know what you'd be losing
If you don't go take a chance on young Annie Mae
So red flags flew on short hills road
Moved my life in to just let go
Of the stones I broke when I was alone
But I learned you never lose 'em anyway
'Cause desperation does what willing won't
Takes you a little further down the road
To make you do the things you don't
Wanna have to battle on your own
And it ain't right, it takes a toll
It's a little lighter as you go
'Cause, desperation does what willing won't
Started getting rough after three damn months
But that's enough to see some healing
I felt at home amongst the storm she kept at bay
And after six more, she made it clear she'd had enough
I finally learned what'd I'd be losing
When I went and lost my chance with Annie Mae
So red flags flew on short hills road
I just hung around, I didn't wanna go
And we both knew we'd hate to be alone
We were just counting down the days 'til
Desperation does what willing won't
Takes you a little further down the road
To make you do the things you don't
Wanna have to battle on your own
And it ain't right, it takes a toll
It's a little lighter as you go
'Cause, desperation does what willing won't
When she moved on, my heart quickly restless
Fading hopes that the lifeline would last
A faded mind made me start to act reckless
And I wish I could take it all back
And it kills me to think that I worshiped
A mirror that was destined to crack
And I just can't stop thinking about her
How she set me, then knocked me off track
When red flags flew on short hills road
Haven't been back, but I can't let go
Of the time she stole, now that I'm alone
But we both know it's better off that way
'Cause desperation does what willing won't
Takes you a little further down the road
To make you do the things you don't
Wanna have to battle on your own
Oh, it ain't right, it takes a toll
It's a little lighter as you go
'Cause, desperation does what willing won't
'Cause, desperation does what willing won't
Swear, I can't live another day like this
Desperation made me do things
So I wrote a song about the past to just let go
