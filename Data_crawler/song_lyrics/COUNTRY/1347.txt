Song Name: Small Town Story
Chapter one
Learn to crawl
Learn to walk
Learn to play a little ball
Make some friends
Learn to bend that little six-string Yamaha
Got a truck hand me down
Drove around til graduation day
Didn't have too much to say
Then I saw your blue eyes
And you smile back at me
Just a matter of time, till I was down on one knee
It was just black and white, then it all came to light
When I met you that night
That's when I started to write
The small town story of my life
Chapter two
Said I do
Then we flew
Around the world on our honeymoon
Chapter three
Found a piece of ground, little house with a tin roof
Chapter four
Hung a swing out on the porch
Baby I can't wait to write a hundred more
Since I saw your blue eyes
And you smiled back at me
Just a matter of time, till I was down on one knee
It was just black and white, then it all came to light
When I met you that night
That's when I started to write
The small town story of my life
I was just the same boy, same town
Doing the same old things
Wasn't nothing but some words on a page
Till I saw your blue eyes
And you smiled back at me
Just a matter of time, till I was down on one knee
It was just black and white, then it all came to light
When I met you that night
That's when I started to write
The small town story of my life
Woah oh
You're the small town story of my life (Yeah)
Chapter five
The dog arrives
Chapter six
Are we talking kids?
We're gonna have to see
Gonna have to read
The small town story
The small town story of my life
