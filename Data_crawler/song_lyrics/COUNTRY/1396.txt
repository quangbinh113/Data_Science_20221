Song Name: Huntin' Season
Haven't seen him once all weekend
House ain't cold, my phone ain't ringin'
Didn't even say that he was leavin'
Oh, it must be huntin' season
I can shop online, drink all the wine
Binge a whole season of The Real Housewives
Call the girls, we go to town
Never have to put that toilet seat down
Stay up late, talkin' 'bout our feelings
Oh, I do love huntin' season
He don't know it
'Cause I sure don't show it
When I kiss him goodbye and I wish him good luck
Say, "Don't you come back without a twelve-point buck"
'Cause that's the reason
For my new found freedom
No, you ain't thе only one been waitin' all year
Oh, dear, I do lovе huntin' season
He thinks it's hot how I'm supportive
I put it right there on the calendar for him
Say, "Don't worry, baby, I'll be back in a hurry"
I just hope he don't tag out early
He don't know it
'Cause I sure don't show it
When I kiss him goodbye and I wish him good luck
Say, "Don't you come back without a twelve-point buck"
'Cause that's reason
For my new found freedom
No, you ain't the only one been waitin' all year
Oh, dear, I do love huntin' season
That's right
Aw, yeah
Don't get me wrong, hope he gets one
A real prize, I hope it's a big one
I just hope it takes a little longer
'Cause absence makes the heart grow fonder (Huh)
He don't know it
'Cause I sure don't show it
When I kiss him goodbye and I wish him good luck
Say, "Don't you come back without a twelve-point buck"
'Cause that's the reason
For my new found freedom
No, you ain't the only one been waitin' all year
Oh, dear, I do love huntin' season
Oh, dear, I do
Love huntin' season
Aw, yeah
