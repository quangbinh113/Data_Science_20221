Song Name: Why Not Me
You been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know that this country girl's still free?
Why not me?
So you finally come down to your old home town
Your Kentucky girl's been awaitin' patiently
Why not me?
Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?
You been searchin' from here to Singapore
Ain't it time that you noticed the girl next door, baby?
Why not me?
You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be
Why not me?
Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?
You been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know this country girls still free?
Why not me?
Why not me?
Baby, why not me?
Ohh, baby, why not me?
Ohh, baby why not me?
Ohh, baby why not me?
