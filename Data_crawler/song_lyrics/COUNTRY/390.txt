Song Name: Landslide
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain then I turned around
And I saw my reflection in a snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Uh-uh (uh-uh)
Uh-uh (uh-uh), uh-uh, uh
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
I'm getting older too, well
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well, I'm getting older too
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and ya turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
The landslide will bring you down
