Song Name: Good Morning Beautiful
Good mornin' beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good mornin' beautiful day
I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
But since you came along
I can face the dawn
'Cause I know you'll be there
Good mornin' beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good mornin' beautiful day
I'll never worry
If it's rainin' outside
'Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines
Good mornin' beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good mornin' beautiful day, yeah
Ooh, Good mornin' beautiful day
(Good mornin' beautiful)
It's a beautiful day
(Good mornin' beautiful)
Good mornin'
(Good mornin' beautiful)
What a beautiful day!
(Good mornin' beautiful)
