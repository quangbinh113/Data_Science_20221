Song Name: If I Didn't Have You
Well I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot that I don't regret
Then I hung around til you said 'I do'
Knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Well, it changed my thinking when you changed your name
Neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
Cuz I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you I'd long ago been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Floundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain or a hurricane, that's where I'd have been
But I didn't get lost cuz I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold, dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
Oh I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Well, I count my blessings
Every night I pray
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day
Every day he does, cuz God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you I'd long ago been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Floundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain or a hurricane, that's where I'd have been
But I didn't get lost cuz I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold, dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
Oh I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Well, I've already said it but I swear it's true
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
