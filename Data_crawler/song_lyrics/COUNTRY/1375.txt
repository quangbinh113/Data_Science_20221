Song Name: Outlaws & Outsiders
Got a gypsy soul, I'm a rebel and rogue
And I'm always on the run
With a fire inside, I ain't ever gonna die
I'm a locked and loaded gun
When the matches strike and the gasoline lights
It's only just begun
One thing I learned is you can watch it all burn
But the flame ain't ever done
Ah-ooh
Raise 'em up a little higher, your lighters
Outlaws and outsiders
Ah-ooh
Some call me a renegade, the enemy
Throw your hands up if you feel the same
Whoa, living life at the edge
Just say what you wanna say or walk away
I'll stand tall when there's hell to pay
Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders
Mmm, yeah
I was born in the dark with a fearless heart
And a taste for the other side
I was crazy ass kid, all the shit I did
I'm amazed that I'm still alive
They thought I'd change with a little bit of age
But you know I never will
Takes too much time to walk a straight line
I don't have time to kill
Ah-ooh
Raise your fist up higher, you fighters
Outlaws and outsiders
Ah-ooh
Some call me a renegade, the enemy
Throw your hands up if you feel the same
Whoa, living life at the edge
Just say what you wanna say or walk away
I'll stand tall when there's hell to pay
Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders
Mmm, mmm
Some call me a renegade, the enemy
Throw your hands up if you feel the same
Whoa, living life at the edge
Just say what you wanna say or walk away
I'll stand tall when there's hell to pay
Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders
Outlaws and outsiders
Oh, yeah
Mmm, mmm
