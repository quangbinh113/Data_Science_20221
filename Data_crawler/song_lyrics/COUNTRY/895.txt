Song Name: Country Christmas
Mommy, popped the popcorn and we string it on the tree
Apples nuts and candy, oh, what a Christmas feel
Daddy played the organ and we'll all sing Silent Night
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered 'round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
Aunt Annie Belle will be here Uncle Bill and their nine kids
We'll make pallets on the floor just like we always did
Grandma bake the pies and cakes, oh, what a pretty sight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered 'round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered 'round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
