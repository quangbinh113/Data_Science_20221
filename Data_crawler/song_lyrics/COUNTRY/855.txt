Song Name: Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yule tide gay
From now on our troubles will be far away
Here we are as in golden days
Happy golden days of your
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star up on the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Choir:
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of your
Martina:
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
