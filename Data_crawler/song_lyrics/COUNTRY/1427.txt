Song Name: Made 4
One by one, everybody's leaving town
If I tried that I'd be turning back around
Cause I'm too tied up in trying to figure out
The perfect way to tell you how
We don't need too much to make it work nah
All we need is three little words
And a 4 door Ford with same 4 chords playing out 4 rolled down windows
Sippin' 4 cold Coors, packing 6 more
For the little Hole 4 turns off a back road
The same 4 lights, 4-down Friday nights yeah
Feeling just like forever
No I couldn't see me needing anything more yeah
That's the kinda life, that's the kinda life
I was made 4
I'm kinda in a rush to get the years flyin' by
Got it all planned out, yeah I made up my mind
We can buy Fixer-Up and fill it up over time
With 2 or 3 kids thanking you for their eyes and a
4 door Ford with same 4 chords playing out 4 rolled down windows
Sippin' 4 cold Coors, packing 6 more
For the little Hole 4 turns off a back road
The same 4 lights, 4-down Friday nights yeah
Feeling just like forever
No I couldn't see me needing anything more yeah
That's the kinda life, that's the kinda life
I was made 4
You and me with a fire in the backyard
Sundress and a Bass Pro Hat
And only needing you in my arms
Yeah we made for that
You and me were made for that
4 door Ford, my hand in yours
With same four chords
Playing out four rolled down windows
Sippin' 4 cold Coors packing 6 more
For the little Hole 4 turns off a back road
The same 4 lights, 4-down Friday nights yeah
Feeling just like forever
No I couldn't see me needing anything more yeah
That's the kinda life, that's the kinda life
I was made for
That's the kinda life, that's the kinda life
I was made for
