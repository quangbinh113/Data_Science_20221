Song Name: Ten Thousand Angels
Speakin' of the devil
Look who just walked in
He knows just where to find me
Here we go again
I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance
But that's not as far as he wants to go
I need ten thousand angels to help me tell him no
Lead me not into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight all that I'm feelin'
But I can't do it alone
Help me break this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels watchin' over me tonight
It's time to face my weakness
Look him in the eye
Lord knows it won't be easy
But I've just gotta try
I can't let myself get lost in his arms
That's how I got my heart broke before
I need ten thousand angels to walk me out the door
Lead me not into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight all that I'm feelin'
But I can't do it alone
Help me break this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels watchin' over me tonight
I need ten thousand angels watchin' over me tonight
Ten thousand angels, watchin' over me tonight
Ten thousand angels, watchin' over me tonight
Watchin' over me tonight...
