Song Name: For the Good Times
Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft, against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times
I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find
You ever need me
Don't say a word
About tomorrow, or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times
