Song Name: Bad Reputation
Another night in another bed
Nothing new to me
Another woman that I just met
Is finally falling asleep
This is when I should be sneakin out
Making my get away
But lying here looking at her now
I just wanna stay
I never saw it coming
I thought it'd be nothing
But it's nothing like I've ever had
What the hell am I doing
If I don't leave soon
I'm gonna ruin my bad reputation
There are girls all over town
I don't wanna run into
And all the rumors they're spreading around
Most of them are true
There was something about last night
That I don't wanted to end
If I leave without saying goodbye I'm scared I'll never see her again
No I never saw it coming
I thought it'd be nothing
But it's nothing like I've ever had
What the hell am I doing
If I don't leave soon
I'm gonna ruin my bad reputation
Now the sun's coming through those blinds
There she's waking up next to me
Something tells me when I look in her eyes
She can change everything
I never saw it coming
I thought it'd be nothing
But it's nothing like I've ever had
What the hell am I doing
If I don't leave soon
I'm gonna ruin my bad reputation
Oh oh reputation
