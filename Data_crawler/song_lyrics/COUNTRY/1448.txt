Song Name: This Damn Song
Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye
You wanna go, then baby, just leave
Don't tell me that, "You still care, that I'll always be special"
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck
4 a.m., writin' this damn song
I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay
Give it time and I'll soon move on
You said, "My life was too fucked up to be with you"
But here you go to the bar 'til 2 a.m.
I wanna know what he has that I don't
Well, I was ready for the real thing
No more shame in this life I live, 'cause I would change for you
Don't know the hope you gave to me
But I guess that I'm okay, just need some cocaine
And a bottle it'll float my mind
And take a trip to another world where you would be mine
Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye
You wanna go, then baby, just leave
Don't tell me that, "You still care, that I'll always be special"
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck
4 a.m., writin' this damn song
I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay
Give it time and I'll soon move on
I found a couple of your long hairs in the passenger seat
Where you looked over, smiled at me
Guess, "A picture ain't worth as many words" as they say
And don't tell me that, "It's okay", I'll find my own way
Don't need your excuse to ease my pain
Guess it's just time for me to work on me
Well, I don't wanna hear the good side, there ain't no good side
You ain't never gonna see what I see
Don't tell me that, "You still care, that I'll always be special"
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck
4 a.m., writin' this damn song
I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay
Give it time and I'll soon move on
Give it time and I'll soon move on
