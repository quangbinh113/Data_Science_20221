Song Name: Outlaw Angel
She'll be her daddy's little Angel 'til the day she dies
But me I know the truth
She's got a wild side 100 miles wide
And a temper like a dynamite fuse
Washed in the blood and the Brazos mud
Baptized by an old Hank song
She's hell on wheels and blue jeans
Takes all I've got to hold on
My Outlaw Angel sipping on whiskey on a Tuesday night
Outlaw Angel breaking all the rules when we dim those lights
Might have a little bit of red
Dirt on the tip of her wings
But my Outlaw Angel sure loves the devil out of me
Feeling like Jesse James takin' down a bank
When you're sittin' right by my side
You're the reason God made them Sunday mornings
Right after Saturday night
And I can't tell just what the hell
Them pretty little blue eyes see
Somewhere between a saint and fall from grace
She saved a wretch like me
My Outlaw Angel sipping on whiskey on a Tuesday night
Outlaw Angel breaking all the rules when we dim those lights
Might have a little bit of red
Dirt on the tip of her wings
But my outlaw Angel sure loves the devil out of me
My Outlaw Angel
My Outlaw Angel
My Outlaw Angel sipping on whiskey on a Tuesday night
Outlaw Angel breaking all the rules when we dim those lights
Might have a little bit of red
Dirt on the tip of her wings
My Outlaw Angel sure loves the devil out of me
She loves the devil out of me
