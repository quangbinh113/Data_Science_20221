Song Name: No One Else On Earth
I've been a rock and I've got my fences
I never let them down
When it comes to love, I keep my senses
I don't get kicked around
I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm outta control
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like-
No one could love me like you
You can make me want you
Any time you want to
You're burning me alive
I can't deny you
Even when I catch you
Weaving a weak alibi
'Cause when the night falls
You make me forget
Your love is killing me
And it ain't over yet
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like-
No one could love me like you
I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm outta control
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like-
No one could love me like-
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like-
No one could love me like you
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one like you
No one like you
