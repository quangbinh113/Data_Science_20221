Song Name: Lover, Lover
Well, the truth, well, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back
Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right
Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Well, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back
Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
There was a time, oh, woman when you used to shake it for me
But now all you do is just treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
No good no more, more, more, more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I went with you on a starry night
And I'm hurtin' too bad 'cause you don't treat me right
Oh, woman oh, woman, you know I love you so
But you're just so mean to me
Baby, I'm walkin' out the door
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
No good no more, more, more
I know you used to love me in every way
But now I'm givin' up and I'm tired of cryin', babe
I can't stand it no longer, it hurts me to say
But I'm packin' up my bags and goin' far away
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
(Treat me good no more)
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
(Treat me good no more)
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
(Treat me good no more)
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
