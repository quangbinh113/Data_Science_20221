Song Name: When You Say Nothing At All
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without sayin' a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothin' at all
All day long I can hear people talkin' out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Ol' Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothin' at all
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothin' at all
