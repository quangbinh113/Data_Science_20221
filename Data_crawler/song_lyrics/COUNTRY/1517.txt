Song Name: Creek Don't Rise
I've been thinkin' bout you and me
And all this time we spend together
I got a feeling baby can't you see
Its all good but it could be better
One of these days gonna get it right
Good Lord willin' and the creek dont rise
You've been running just to find yourself
Glad that you found your way back home
You've been mussing me can't you tell
Ani't no reason you should be alone
You and me baby goin' out tonight
Goog Lord willin' and the creek dont rise
Creek dont rise
Moon is shinin'
Stars alignin'
Feel it comin' on.
Hey!
I've been waiting baby long enough
Ain't gotta worry it'll be just fine.
Now or never baby give it up
Move a little closer put your hand in mine
You look pretty damn good tonight
You and me baby gonna get it right
Ain't goin' down till the mornin light
Good Lord willin' and the creek dont rise,
Creek dont rise,
Creek dont rise,
Creek dont rise.
