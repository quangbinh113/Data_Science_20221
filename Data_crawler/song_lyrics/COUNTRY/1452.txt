Song Name: Horses in Heaven
Grandpa taught me how to ride
On a buckskin mare when I was five
He told me the way of life was in my blood
And I learned the ropes, how to hold the reins
When I got thrown had to hide the pain
He'd give me the eye and I'd get back up
And these days
I don't know if he's rounding up a herd of cattle
Or going for eight in his old bronc saddle
Or teaching a young buck a hard-learned well-earned lesson
I don't know if he's roaming around just to pass the time
Somewhere up there on the other side
Checking a fence line just as the sun is settin'
But y'all I'm sure that he's riding horses in heaven
Stubborn, strong, thicker skin
I'm who I am 'cause of him
Teaching this girl all that cowboy stuff
And you may say, "May he rest in peace"
But he ain't resting if you ask me
If I know him, he's up there kicking up dust
I don't know if he's rounding up a herd of cattle
Or going for eight in his old bronc saddle
Or teaching a young buck a hard-learned well-earned lesson
I don't know if he's roaming around just to pass the time
Somewhere up there on the other side
Checking a fence line just as the sun is settin'
But y'all I'm sure that he's riding horses in heaven
Well, I think the angels must've wanted a helping hand
And they needed a cowboy, not just any man
I don't know if he's rounding up a herd of cattle
Or going for eight in his old bronc saddle
Or teaching a young buck a hard-learned well-earned lesson
I don't know if he's roaming around just to pass the time
Somewhere up there on the other side
Checking a fence line just as the sun is settin'
But y'all I'm sure that he's riding horses in heaven
Grandpa taught me how to ride
On a buckskin mare when I was five
He told me the way of life was in my blood
