Song Name: Boondocks
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
And I can feel
That muddy water running through my veins
And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
And it sings to me and it sounds familiar
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
And I can taste
That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old camp creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
It's where I learned about living
It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am
Give me a tin roof
A front porch and a gravel road
And that's home to me
It feels like home to me
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
You get a line, I get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
Church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
(Say a little prayer for me) church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
(Say a little prayer for me) church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
(Say a little prayer for me) church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
(Say a little prayer for me) church on Sunday morning
You get a line, I get a pole (you get a line, I get a pole)
We'll go fishing (we'll go fishing in the crawfish hole)
Down in the boondocks (five card poker on Saturday night)
(Say a little prayer for me) church on Sunday morning
