Song Name: Me and Bobby McGee
If it sounds country man
That's what it is
It's a country song, yeah, okay
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, and headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all away to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands, we finally sang up
Every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home, I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for me
Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
La la la...
Me and Bobby McGee
La la la...
Me and Bobby McGee
La la la...
Me and Bobby McGee
La la la...
