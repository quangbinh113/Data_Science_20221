Song Name: Rewind
I'd pour the whiskey back in the bottle
Put the bottle back on the shelf
Take the words "I don't love you"
And put 'em back in my mouth
Those teardrops would have never left her eyes
And I wouldn't be here losing my mind
If I could rewind
I wish I'd told my friends I was busy
The day I told my grandpa no
And we'd have spent the whole day fishin
Down there at Canyon Cove
What I'd give to watch that bobber on his line
And hear his same old stories one more
If I could rewind
Fast forward back to yesterday
I'd hit pause instead of play
And take it all in, but the simple fact is
You can't turn back the hands of time
Lord knows how hard I've tried
Cause life don't always give you second chances
Fast forward back to yesterday
I'd hit pause instead of play
And take it all in, but the simple fact is
You can't rewind the hands of time
Heaven knows how hard I've tried
Cause life don't always give you second chances
I should've went to see Merle Haggard
The last time he was here
And should've stopped John Paul from driving
After drinkin that last beer
Now it's hard to sing along to Mama Tried
And pass by that wooden cross where my friend died
I poured the whiskey back in the bottle
And put the bottle back on the shelf
