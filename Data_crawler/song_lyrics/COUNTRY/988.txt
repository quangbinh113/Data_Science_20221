Song Name: Wild Honey
Honey, I wanna let down my hair
I wanna be with you everywhere
I wanna ride off into the blue
Oh, honey
Don't you wanna feel the beat in your heart?
Don't you wanna dance in the dark?
Don't you wanna feel somethin' new?
Feel the fire
The burn of desire
It's passin' us by
Whatever drives you wild, honey
Whichever way the wind blows your mind
Whatever sets your soul on fire, I'm tellin' you
Oughta find what gets you high
What keeps you up at night
Whatever drives you wild
Wild, honey
Honey, won't you give it a chancе?
Won't you let me hold your hand?
Come on, baby
Thе fire
The burn of desire
Is passin' us by
Whatever drives you wild, honey
Whichever way the wind blows your mind
Whatever sets your soul on fire, I'm tellin' you
Oughta find what gets you high
What keeps you up at night
Whatever drives you wild
Wild, wild, honey
Don't you wanna feel forever young?
Don't you wanna be the ones that never grow up?
Don't you wanna feel forever young?
Don't you wanna be the ones?
Whatever drives you wild, honey
Whichever way the wind blows your mind
Whatever sets your soul on fire, I'm tellin' you
Oughta find what gets you high
What keeps you up at night
Whatever drives you wild
Wild, honey
