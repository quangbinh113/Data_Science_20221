Song Name: The Devil’s Still Down in Georgia
Candy apple Telecaster
And I knew someone in the band
Never been a goner faster
If I did or didn't have him, I'd be damned
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no
Wish I'd known
Don't go west of Caroline
You'll make your bed in Hell
Don't go south of Tennessee
There's poison in that well
Well, no, Heaven doesn't feel as hot
Once you've got a taste of fire
Ain't no signs to warn you
He's alive and well
Yeah, the devil's still down in Georgia
Georgia
He said hе likes that I'm a singer
Said he'd play on all my songs
But hе clipped my wings and that's the stinger
My soul and every dream I had
He took 'em and got gone
No, don't go west of Caroline
You'll make your bed in Hell
Don't go south of Tennessee
There's poison in that well
Well, no, Heaven doesn't feel as hot
Once you've got a taste of fire
Ain't no signs to warn you
He's alive and well
Yeah, the devil's still down in Georgia
Georgia
I didn't know I needed you
The kind you can't undo
But it's hard to sell the tell 'em no
When he's lookin' right at you
Don't go west of Caroline
He'll make your bed in Hell, oh, no
Don't go south of Tennessee
There's poison in that well
Well, no, Heaven doesn't feel as hot
Once you've got a taste of fire
Ain't no signs to warn you
He's alive and well
Yeah, the devil's still
He's alive and well
Yeah, the devil's still down in Georgia
Georgia
Georgia
Georgia
