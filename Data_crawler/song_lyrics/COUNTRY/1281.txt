Song Name: Steady Heart - Wedding Version
She's a glass of wine on a back porch and I'm a bourbon in a bar
She's an angel from Montgomery, I'm an old pawn shop guitar
She's wildflowers in a Mason jar, I'm barbed wire on an old fence post
We go together like a gravel road and an AM radio
But God only knows where we'll end up
When you mix my calloused ways with her sweet touch
She's a candlelight in all my dark
When we come together we're the best of who we are
My stubborn mind and her steady heart
Her steady heart
Her whisper brings the sunrise, her kiss could stop the rain
Her midnight prayers always calm the crazy in my brain
Yeah, we take it day by day
God only knows where we'll end up
When you mix my calloused ways with her sweet touch
She's a candlelight in all my dark
When we come together we're the best of who we are
My stubborn mind and her steady heart
Her steady heart
Oh, oh!
God only knows where we'll end up
When you mix my calloused ways with her sweet touch
She's a candlelight in all my dark
When we come together we're the best of who we are
My stubborn mind and her steady heart
Her steady heart
Her steady heart
