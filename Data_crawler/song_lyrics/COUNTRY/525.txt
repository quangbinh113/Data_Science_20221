Song Name: Every Light In The House
I told you I'd leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took your every word to heart
'Cause I can't stand us bein' apart
Just to show how much I really miss ya
Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone
Every light in house is on
If I should ever start forgetting
I'll turn the lights off one by one
So you can see that I agree, it's over
But until then I want you to know
If you look south you'll see a glow
That's me waitin' at home each night to hold ya
Every light in the house is on
The back yard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone
Oh, every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone
Every light in the house is on
