Song Name: Chevy Nova
It was brand new way back in '73
It was thirdhand when it got passed down to me
Had a crack in the windshield, but, man, it ran like a top
And had a Kenwood deck and some Alpine speakers
Sittin' up behind the wheel, Lord, I never felt freer
They could hear me comin' from a mile away in that high school parking lot
Well, turnin' up Springsteen and the best of Waylon
When you're sixteen, you gotta earn that bad reputation
Blew some smoke, left some marks, ran some lights, drove it like it was stolen
And every mile made a mеmory, foot heavy on that Chevy Nova
Parked in a fiеld on the outskirts of town
With a girl I knew that grew up four doors down
We were making out, making moves in the moonlight
Fog on the glass, t-shirt hangin' on the rearview
Fallin' fast, flirtin' with her curfew
I took curves on two wheels tryna get her home by midnight
Turnin' up Springsteen and the best of Waylon
When you're sixteen, you gotta earn that bad reputation
Blew some smoke, left some marks, ran some lights, drove it like it was stolen
Every mile made a memory, foot heavy on that Chevy Nova
If that car could've talked, it would've done me in
With stories of the old times, oh, back then
All the beers I drank and the innocence lost
Chances I took, it was there for it all
Turnin' up Springsteen and the best of Waylon
When you're sixteen, you gotta earn that bad reputation
Blew some smoke, left some marks, ran some lights, drove it like it was stolen
Every mile made a memory, foot heavy on that Chevy Nova
Every mile made a memory, foot heavy on that Chevy Nova
Chevy Nova
