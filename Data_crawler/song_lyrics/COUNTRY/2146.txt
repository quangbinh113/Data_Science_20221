Song Name: Ride It Hard
Ooh, she gonna ride it hard
She's got the keys to her daddy's car
SS Chevelle ridin' through the dark
Broke my neck when she walked in the bar
She wants a bad boy, I'll play the part
Ooh, she gonna ride it hard (ride it hard)
Ooh, she gonna ride it hard
All my friends say she's bad for me
Maybe they should tell that to the Tennessee
Body on 10 when she hit the scene tonight
(Tonight) tonight (tonight)
From New York City to OKC
Someone that fine I ain't never seen
A girl like her might sound like me, believe
But I've seen stranger things (I've seen stranger things)
I've seen stranger things (I've seen stranger things)
Driving through the city when she handling business
Hand on the stick but this ain't no stick shift
She knows what she doin' when she pushin' the pistons
Got it from her momma it's a family tradition
Ooh, she gonna ride it hard
Ooh, she gonna ride it hard
All my friends say she's bad for me
Maybe they should tell that to the Tennessee
Body on 10 when she hit the scene tonight
(Tonight) tonight (tonight)
From New York City to OKC
Someone that fine I ain't never seen
A girl like her might sound like me, believe
But I've seen stranger things (I've seen stranger things)
I've seen stranger things (I've seen stranger things)
Woah, she gonna ride it hard (ride it hard)
Woah, she gonna ride it hard
If you ain't first, you're last
