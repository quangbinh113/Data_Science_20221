Song Name: Santa Claus Is Comin' (In a Boogie Woogie Choo Choo Train)
Santa Clause is coming
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Santa's been checkin'
Checkin' all around the world
Wants to know what's goin' on
With every single boy and girl
Said, Great gosh, Almighty
Much to my surprise
Nobody's been naughty
Everybody's been nice
Now Santa likes to boogie
Santa likes to dance
Santa likes to rock it
Likes to go real fast
Santa likes to ride
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Santa's got the elves workin'
Workin' overtime
He's doubled up production
On the toy production line
He says there's too much stuff
This year to carry in the sleigh
Got to get a better plan
Got to find a better way
We got toys for the boys
And they're all over the place
Got 'em stacked in the ceiling
Gotta stick it in your face
He says that this year
We're gonna take the boogie woogie
Choo choo train
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
We got toys for the boys
And they're all over the place
Got 'em stacked in the ceiling
Gotta stick it in your face
Sants Claus is coming
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Rudolph says, wait a minute
What about me?
Don't leave me sittin' all alone
At home on Christmas Eve
Santa said no way, man
We gotta have your nose
To show us all the way
To show us where to go
We got Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
We all goin' ridin' in a
Boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
We got toys for the boys
And they're all over the place
Got 'em stacked in the ceiling
Gotta stick it in your face
You know Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
We got toys for the boys
And they're all over the place
Got 'em stacked in the ceiling
Gotta stick it in your face
You know Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
Santa Claus is comin'
In a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
