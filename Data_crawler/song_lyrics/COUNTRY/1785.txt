Song Name: Burning Man
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life making trouble
Half your life making it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close
I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rolling stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh andbone
Little found, little don't know where I am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long
I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rolling stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh and bone
Little found, little don't know where I am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Trees
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light and
Tell me you burned just like me
I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rolling stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh and bone
Little found, little don't know where I am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Burning man
