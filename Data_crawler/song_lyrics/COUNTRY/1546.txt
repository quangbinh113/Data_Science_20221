Song Name: Wabash Cannonball
From the great Atlantic ocean
To the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains
To the southbelt by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome
And known quite well by all
She's the combination
On the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham
One cold December day
As she rolled into the station
You could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee
She's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham
On the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandies
So the people always say
From New York to St. Louis
And Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota
Where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken
On the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton
May his name forever stand
And always be remembered
'Round the courts of Alabam
His earthly race is over
And the curtains round him fall
We'll carry home to vic'try
On the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle
And the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands
Through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine
Hear that lonesome hobo squall
You're travlin' through the jungles
On the Wabash Cannonball
