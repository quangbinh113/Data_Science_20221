Song Name: Hits a Little Different
I bought my first thirty pack when I was sixteen
But that was just some change and a fake ID
Moving back with the boys out by the creek
Well I've had 'em in a bottle, I've had 'em in a can
In the dance hall neon around in the sand
Don't matter where or when it went down, the same
But tonight there's gotta be more than the beer to blame
'Cause this buzz got me feeling like it's my first time popping a top again
Got me leaning a little closer to the smile that you've been giving me all night
Got me feeling just right, bartender keep 'em coming to the morning light
Girl, I swear I've only had a few, it hits a little different when I'm drinking with you
I give myself reasons why I'm feeling this way
Double-check the lane, and it's all the same
Stuff I've been drinking got me overthinking it all
Must be another reason than this alcohol
'Cause this buzz got me feeling like it's my first time popping a top again
Got me leaning a little closer to the smile that you've been giving me all night
Got me feeling just right, bartender keep 'em coming to the morning light
Girl, I swear I've only had a few, just hits a little different when I'm drinking with you
Could it be the barley?
Could it be the hops?
Could it be the way that you're looking in that crop top?
'Cause damn
This buzz got me feeling like it's my first time popping a top again
Got me leaning a little closer to the smile that you've been giving me all night
Got me feeling just right, bartender keep 'em coming to the morning light
Girl, I swear I've only had a few, just hits a little different when I'm drinking with you
Hits a little different with you
