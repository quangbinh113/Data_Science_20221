Song Name: Hometown Tonight
You had big city dreams, flashin' lights, another street
Five hundred miles from the gravel where we used to meet
Right in the middle of my black Chevy bench seat
We named the stars layin' underneath the pine trees
You see, I'm missin' that simple way of livin'
That picture perfect memory, I can paint it in a minute
Let me be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
I'll be your backroad, on a long kiss goodnight
I'll be that country station that we sang on (sang on)
I'll put you back on the map dot we was raised on (raised on)
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
Population two, only me and you
We can cross some county lines like we always used to do
Oh, I know you're missin' that simple way of livin'
Your clothes on the branch, couple lovers skinny dippin'
Let me be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
I'll be your backroad, on a long kiss goodnight
I'll be that country station that we sang on (sang on)
I'll put you back on the map dot we was raised on (raised on)
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
Home, home, home, hometown tonight
Home, home, home, hometown tonight

Population two, only me and you
We can cross some county lines like we always used to do
Let me be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
I'll be your backroad, on a long kiss goodnight
I'll be that country station that we sang on (we sang on)
I'll put you back on the map dot we was raised on (raised on)
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight (tonight)
I'll be your home, home, home, hometown tonight
Home, home, home, hometown tonight
We can cross some county lines like we always used to do (home, home, home, hometown tonight)
