Song Name: Pick Me Up
Mmm
It's been one of those days I don't wanna do twice
No matter what I say, it doesn't come out right
I need one of those nights when you slide me close
'Til we're off the map and you're makin' me laugh
I don't care if we ever go home
So pick me up, get me lost way out
Down a back two-lane, little George Strait way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be all right
Make the world go black, how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick me up, mmm
We could ride on past every one-light street
Watch the full moon crash on some sunrise wheat
You can kiss me fast and drive real slow
That old Chevy might take as long as it takes
You and Jesus will fix my soul
So pick me up, get me lost way out
Down a back two-lane, little George Strait way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be all right
Make the world go black, how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick me up
Mmm, yeah, just pick me up
Ooh, get me lost way out
Down a back two-lane, little George Strait way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be all right
Make the world go black, how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick me up
Mmm, yeah, just pick me up
(Mmm, yeah, just pick me up)
