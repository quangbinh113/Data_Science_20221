Song Name: I Like You Better
I like you better
When your makeup's off
And you're wearing my old sweater yeah
When you do your thing
I could sit and watch forever
No you ain't like them
You don't need help from filters and flashing lights
To catch my eye
You're better 'cause
You're heavenly from every view yeah
I don't believe you when
You're telling me that you don't see it too
That you don't need a dress on to make you fine
You don't need a halo to make you shine
Like all of the angels
In those magazines do
No I like you better when you're you
Yeah you don't mean it
But when you smile and toss your hair back I stop breathing
With that heart of gold you got everything I'm needing
No it don't get old
Counting up all the ways you get it right
No you don't have to try
Yeah you do it better 'cause
You're heavenly from every view yeah
I don't believe you when
You're telling me that you don't see it too
That you don't need a dress on to make you fine
You don't need a halo to make you shine
Like all of the angels
In those magazines do
No I like you better when you're you
I like you better when you're you
You're heavenly from every view yeah
I don't believe you when
You're telling me that you don't see it too
You don't need a dress on to make you fine
You don't need a halo to make you shine
Like all of the angels
In those magazines do
No I like you better when you're you
I like you better when you're you
Better when you're you
Mmm yeah
I like you better when you're
