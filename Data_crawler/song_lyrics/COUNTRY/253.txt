Song Name: All To Myself
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearin'
And the way they're holdin' you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on starin'
So lock the door and turn out the night
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talkin'
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singin'
And the way it's rollin' off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinkin'
I don't need nothin' between you
Leanin' for another kiss, yeah
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talkin'
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all
All
All to myself
To myself, yeah
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmm)
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talkin'
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket (In my back pocket)
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all
All
All to myself
To myself
I want you all
All
All to myself
To myself, yeah
