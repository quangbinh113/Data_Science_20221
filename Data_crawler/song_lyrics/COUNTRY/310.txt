Song Name: Beat of the Music
Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I'd get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walkin' up askin' me to dance
Smilin' that smile and reachin' out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I've still got the chance
You got the soul and
You know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip 'cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racin' like there's nothin' to it
Fallin' in love to the beat of the music
Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey
'Cause you got the soul and
You know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip 'cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racin' like there's nothin' to it
Fallin' in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music
I think I could get used to that steel drum playin'
Wakin' up on a beach if you know what I'm sayin'
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby 'cause
You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip 'cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racin' like there's nothin' to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to beat of the music
Oh oh. Beat of the music. Ya ya ya,
Ya ya ya
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya
