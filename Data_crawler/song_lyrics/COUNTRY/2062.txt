Song Name: Till the Wheels Fall Off
All or nothin', the way it's supposed to be
Swingin' for the fence at every opportunity
Up and over the mountain while everybody goes 'round
All the rest stand still, I pick 'em up and I put 'em down
I still push and I still shove
I'm still hard to love
I ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was
They say the day will come
I'll be too tired to run
Yeah, you can't stop what's coming
I'll run until the wheels fall off
Run until the wheels fall off
Cracked wide open, way out over the line
Out there and grab it 'cause it's dyin' on the vine
The wealth and the glory
The worship and the fame
They love you and they hate you, boy
But they all know your name
I still push and I still shove
I'm still hard to love
I ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was
They say the day will come
I'll be too tired to run
Yeah, you can't stop what's coming
I'll run until the wheels fall off
Run until the wheels fall off
Run until the wheels fall off
I still push and I still shove
I'm still hard to love
I ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was
They say the day will come
I'll be too tired to run
Yeah, you can't stop what's coming
I'll run until the wheels fall off
Run until the wheels fall off
Run until the wheels fall off
