Song Name: EASY TONIGHT
Hey
Alright

Man, I love this place
Let me tell you 'bout it
This old bar is paradise
Ain't nothing here that I don't like
The perfect place to waste some time
That's right
Where the music is playin'
People are singing
Like these old Levi's, yeah, we're getting faded
No, I just can't get enough
Bartender, fill up my cup
'Cause I just wanna raise one up
It's going down easy tonight
Ain't it good when it all feels right?
'Tween this drink in my hand
And some real good friends
It's going down easy tonight
The beer is cheap, but man, it's cold
A country song's on the radio
And I hope Heaven is real damn close to this
Where the music is playin' (turn it up)
People are singing
Like these old Levi's, yeah, we're getting faded
No, I just can't get enough
Bartender, fill up my cup
'Cause I just wanna raise one up (raise 'em up, y'all)
It's going down easy tonight
Ain't it good when it all feels right? (So right)
'Tween this drink in my hand
And some real good friends
It's going down easy tonight (woo)
Night like these are made for letting go
But we'll get there faster if we take it slow
It's going down easy tonight
Ain't it good when it all feels right?
'Tween this drink in my hand
And some real good friends
It's going down easy tonight
Yeah, it's going down easy tonight (it's going down)
Ain't it good when it all feels right? (So right)
Yeah, they're pouring 'em strong while we're singing along
It's going down easy tonight (that's right)
Yeah, it's going down easy tonight (oh, yeah)
It's going down easy tonight
It's going down easy tonight
