Song Name: Peaked In High School
You played the part, you made the team
And you were your own homecoming queen
I never got invited to your parties
You got the guy on Friday nights
I stayed at home and learned to write
You rolled your eyes at my guitar strings
Oh, how things change
Bet now you know my name
Back then, we were stuffing bras
8th grade gossip in the halls
Then freshman year you called me fat at the pool
Spent sophomore year skipping class
Bet junior year you wanted back
By senior year, you were way too damn cool
Well look who peaked in high school
I left the town, you stuck around
You went to state and settled down
And always judge what I was doing
I got a deal, you got divorced
You see my face on Billboard
I changed the number you're still calling
Oh, how things change
Now you drive my name
Back then, we were stuffing bras
8th grade gossip in the halls
Then freshman year you called me fat at the pool
Spent sophomore year skipping class
Bet junior year you wanted back
By senior year, you were way too damn cool
Well look who peaked in high school, oh
So, if you're sittin' all alone
I just want you to know
I was there, it got me here
I'm thankful I didn't peak in high school
And to all the girls who made me cry
Thank you for being here tonight
