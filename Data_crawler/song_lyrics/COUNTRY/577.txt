Song Name: A Little Less Talk And A Lot More Action
I was getting kinda tired of her endless chatter
Nothing I could say ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place to find some satisfaction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
I paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen to a word he said
I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action
A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
Well she was fighting them off at a corner table
She had a longneck bottle she was peeling the label
The look on her face it was perfectly clear
She said somebody please get me out of here
The look she shot me through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk and a lot more action
A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
A little less talk
A lot more action
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
Get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk...
And a lot more action
