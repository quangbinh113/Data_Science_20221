Song Name: Convoy
Ah, breaker one-nine, this here's the Rubber Duck
You got a copy on me, Pig Pen, c'mon?
Ah, yeah, 10-4, Pig Pen, fer shure, fer shure
By golly, it's clean clear to Flag Town, c'mon
Yeah, that's a big 10-4 there, Pig Pen
Yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy
Mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us a convoy
Was the dark of the moon on the sixth of June
In a Kenworth pullin' logs
Cab-over Pete with a reefer on
And a Jimmy haulin' hogs
We was headin' for Bexar on I one-oh
'Bout a mile outta Shaky Town
I says, Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck
And I'm about to put the hammer down
'Cause we got a little ol' convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a little ol' convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
Across the USA
Convoy
Ah, breaker, Pig Pen, this here's the duck
And, uh, you wanna back off them hogs? (Convoy)
Uh, 10-4, 'bout five mile or so, ten, roger
Them hogs is gettin' intense up here
By the time we got into Tulsa town
We had eighty-five trucks in all
But there's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf
And them bears was wall-to-wall
Yeah, them Smokeys as thick as bugs on a bumper
They even had a bear in the air
I says, callin' all trucks, this here's the duck
We about to go a-huntin' bear
'Cause we got a great big convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a great big convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
Across the USA
Convoy
Ah, you wanna give me a 10-9 on that, Pig Pen? (Convoy)
Negatory, Pig Pen, you're still too close
Yeah, them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses
Mercy sakes, you better back off another ten
Well, we rolled up Interstate 44
Like a rocket sled on rails
We tore up all of our swindle sheets
And left 'em settin' on the scales
By the time we hit that Chi-town
Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard
There's armored cars, and tanks, and jeeps
And rigs of every size
Them chicken coops was full'a bears
And choppers filled the skies
Well, we shot the line and we went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
And eleven long-haired friends a' Jesus
In a chartreuse microbus
Yeah, Sodbuster?
Listen, you wanna put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey?
Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get
Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey Shore
Prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a doggone dime
I says, Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck
We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll
So we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight
I says let them truckers roll, 10-4
'Cause we got a mighty convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a mighty convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
Across the USA
Convoy
Ah, 10-4, Pig Pen, what's your 20? (Convoy)
Omaha? (Convoy)
Well, they oughtta know what to do with them hogs out there fer shure
Well, mercy sakes good buddy (Convoy)
We gonna back on outta here
So keep the bugs off yer glass
And the bears off your tail
We'll catch ya on the flip-flop
This here's the Rubber Duck on the side
We gone, bye-bye
