Song Name: Pickin' Wildflowers
Hey baby, whatcha doin' this evenin'
Can 'ya meet me down at the railroad tracks
I got Tom Petty playin' in my silverado
And I've iced down, a six pack
Hey Daisy, don't 'ya worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth, I say
Baby, what you say we go pickin' wildflowers
I got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me, baby, a pickin' wildflowers
Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin' and
Love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around maybe do some pollinating
And dive in like honeybees
Baby, what you say we go pickin' wildflowers
I got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me, baby, a pickin' wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby, won't you come with me
What you say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time pickin' wildflowers
What you say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me, baby, you and me, baby
A pickin' wildflowers
What you say we go, what you say we go
What you say we go, what you say we go
Pickin' wildflowers, a pickin' wildflowers
