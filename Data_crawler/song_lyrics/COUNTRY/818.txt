Song Name: Frosty The Snowman
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run and have some fun
Before I melt away"
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard them holler, "Stop!"
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, saying
"Please don't cry, I'll be back again some day"
