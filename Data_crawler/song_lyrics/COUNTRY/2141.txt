Song Name: Trenches
Honey we belong on a beach
Drowning in sun and Mezcal drinks
Falling asleep to the sound of the sea
And you reading Hemingway to me
But here we are down here in the trenches
Dirt on our faces, digging our ditches
Dodging all the bullets, boy I know it's war out there
There's us, somewhere in the rubble
Making our way, boy hand me a shovel
If it's just you and me, waiting out the enemy
I ain't scared
And when I wanna surrender
I just remember
Tulum in a hammock for two
The skies were pink and your eyes were blue
They both turn a little gray when the bills are due
But fight for me and I'll die for you
'Cause here we are down here in the trenches
Dirt on our faces, digging our ditches
Dodging all the bullets, boy I know it's war out there
There's us, somewhere in the rubble
Making our way, boy hand me a shovel
If it's just you and me, waiting out the enemy
I ain't scared
And when I wanna surrender
I just remember
This kitchen may be real small
But we fell in love in these four walls
We'll find a way out, boy I know
Or we can dig all the way to Mexico
