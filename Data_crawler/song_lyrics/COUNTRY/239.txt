Song Name: Drunk Me
Some people don't know when to quit
And that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom, to see they got a problem
They can't handle it
But, that ain't why I
Started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but
Oh, that would be a lie
I've been sober
'Cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just stand up, head all messed up
Like the sheets, where we made love
I've been sober since you've broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, can't get over you
There ain't no hangover, like you
Can't get over, can't get over
There ain't no hangover like you
Oh, no, no, no
All those bottles sitting up on the shelf
Are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone
Trying not to go home without you
And that ain't nothing, but
A whole lot of pain
And that kinda hurt
Ooh, hurts, it ain't worth another drink
I've been sober
'Cause there ain't no hangover like you
Girl, no no no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just stand up, head all messed up
Like the sheets, where we made love
I've been sober since you've broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no-oh
Can't get over you
Oh, no, no, no
I've been sober
'Cause there ain't no hangover like you
No, no, no
Can you come over?
I always find those words, at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just stand up, head all messed up
Like the sheets, where we made love
I've been sober since you've broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me (oh, drunk me)
Yeah, drunk me
Yeah, drunk me
Can't get over you
There ain't no hangover, like you
Can't get over, can't get over
There ain't no hangover, like you
Oh, no, no, no
