Song Name: Heart On Fire
Roosevelt Road was too rough for my old truck
Yeah, she'd shake and she'd shimmy like Elvis singin' "All Shook Up"
But you can't blame a boy for going, drive it like you stole it fast
With your window down, brown hair blowin', look at me like that
A turned up radio, but the static was heavy
Couldn't make out any words but "take me to the levee"
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin' my soul in gas and settin' my heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
I don't have a single second thought that doesn't have you in it
To feel those flames again, I 'dgo back in a New York minute (New York minute)
I miss the freedom of you dancing on the bow of your daddy's old boat
When my spirit starts sinkin' that picture always makes it float
We weren't old enough to drink but we damn sure did it
Hat turned backward singin' "Paradise City"
That look on your face was full of young desire
Soakin' my soul in gas and settin' my heart on fire
Heart on fire, yeah
Turned up radio, but the static was heavy
Couldn't make out any words but "take me to the levee"
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Heart on fire, heart on fire, heart on fire
Heart on fire, heart on fire, heart on fire
Heart on fire, heart on, heart on fire
Roosevelt Road was too much for my old truck
Yeah, she'd shake and she'd shimmy like Elvis singin' "All Shook Up"
Heart on fire, heart on fire, heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
