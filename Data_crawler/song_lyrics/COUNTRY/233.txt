Song Name: My Girl
She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talkin' to her momma on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man her eyes really drive me crazy

You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl
Yeah, that's my girl
In the passenger seat
Windows down dancin' around causin' a scene
That's my girl sippin' crown and sprite
In a ball cap turned back, ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thank the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl
Yeah, that's my girl
In the passenger seat windows down
Dancin' around causin' a scene
That's my girl, sippin' crown and sprite
In a ball cap turned back, ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh my girl
Yeah, that's my girl
My girl (in my soul that a thing, with the radio on)
That's my girl (in my heart, in my soul in the air that I breath every day)
That's my girl (ya everything) my girl
That's my girl in the passenger seat windows down
Dancin' around causin' a scene
That's my girl, sippin' crown and sprite
In a ball cap turned back, oou she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh my girl
Yeah that's my girl
