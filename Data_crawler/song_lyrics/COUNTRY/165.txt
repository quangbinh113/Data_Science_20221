Song Name: In Case You Didn't Know
I can't count the times
Almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby, I know that you've been wonderin'
So here goes nothin'
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout ya
And I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without ya
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl, it did me in
Got me thinkin'
I'm thinkin'
One of the things that I've been feelin'
It's time you hear 'em
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout ya
And I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without ya
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout ya
I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without ya
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know, know, know
In case you didn't know
