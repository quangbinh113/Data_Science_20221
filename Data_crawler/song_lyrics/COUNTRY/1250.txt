Song Name: Want It Again
When I was your man, and you were my girl
We were technicolor in a black and white world
They say young love just don't last
Well, it looks like they were right about that
And, oh, I hope one day you'll find
Your way back into my arms
So girl, I'll put this heart of mine
Somewhere good and safe, in case you want it again someday
Well, you moved on, and so did I
But you dance around in the back of my mind (back of my mind)
Yeah, good for you, he seems like a good guy
Well, you know me enough to know that's a lie
And, oh, I hope one day you'll find
Your way back into my arms
So girl, I'll put this heart of mine
Somewhere good and safe in case you want it again someday
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh
You called me up, said you had a big fight
I said don't cry, it's gonna be alright
You say, "Come over, you just need a friend"
Well, I'm on my way, I'll be there in ten
And, oh, I knew someday you'd find your way back into my arms
So girl, I kept this heart of mine
Somewhere good and safe
I knew you'd want it again someday
I always hoped and prayed that you'd want it again someday
