Song Name: Where the Wildflowers Lay
He said don't go fallin' in love, my girl
I'm a ramblin' man
I don't stay one place too long
And I don't make no plans
Save that heart for someone
Who's gonna give a damn
I am not that man
I'm not that man
I feel the summer breeze
I can see you by my side
I've tried to let it go
But I still miss you sometimes
If you ever decide you'll be comin' back my way
I'll be here where the wildflowers lay
I didn't wanna love you
I didn't even wanna try
You took this flesh and bones
And you brought me back to life
He said when I leave don't call for me
I hope you understand
That I am not that man
I am not that man
I feel the summer breeze
I can see you by my side
I've tried to let it go
But I still miss you sometimes
If you ever decide you'll be comin' back my way
I'll be here where the wildflowers lay
I feel the summer breeze
I can see you by my side
I've tried to let it go
But I still miss you all the time
If you ever decide you'll be comin' back to stay
I'll be here where the wildflowers lay
