Song Name: Can Down
Well, I just don't get it
Hell, I just don't see
How one 5-foot, two blue-eyed girl
Could wreck a guy like me
So here I am on her back porch
It's looking like I'm stuck
'Tween a case of Rolling Rock and heartache
It's gonna be the end of one of us
I pick one up, crack it open, put it to my lips
I tip it back, take a sip
'Cause if It's gonna be my heart or these double R's
Crushed up on the ground
Can down
She might have my UT hoodie
She got the last word in that good-bye
But I'm killing these cans
'Cause I'll be damned, she gonna get my Saturday night
I pick one up, crack it open, put it to my lips
I tip it back, take a sip
'Cause it it's gonna be my heart or these double R's
Crushed up on the ground
Can down
Can down
There's one more buried down deep in that ice
But I'm leaving no can left behind
So I...
I pick one up, crack it open, put it to my lips
I tip it back, take a sip
'Cause it it's gonna be my heart or these double R's
Crushed up on the ground
Can down
Can down
(Can down)
(Can down)
