Song Name: Say It First
Don't you worry babe, I'll take the heat
So take your guilt, lay it all on me yeah
Used to burn like a wild fire
But we're ashin ashin now
If your eyes are windows to your soul
I'm thinking I already know
So you don't waste your breath tonight on goodbye
I'll say it first, yeah
I'll take the words
Right out of your mouth
It won't even hurt, yeah
Be gone so fast
Before you even turn around
'Cause I got something to get off my lips
And I know you know what it is
No sense in making this worse
So I'll say it first
Oh, yeah
I'll say it first
Oh, yeah
It's time that truth comes out
These thunder clouds been hanging around for
Too long and I ain't afraid to push 'em, push 'em away
I'm so tired of this pain
Standing out here in the rain
So you don't have to waste your breath tonight on goodbye
I'll say it first, yeah
I'll take the words
Right out of your mouth
It won't even hurt, yeah
Be gone so fast
Before you even turn around
'Cause I got something to get off my lips
And I know you know what it is
No sense in making this worse
So I'll say it first
Yeah
I'll say it first
You don't have to waste your breath tonight on goodbye
We both know that there's nothing left that's why
I'll say it first, yeah
I'll take the words
Right out of your mouth
It won't even hurt, yeah
Be gone so fast
Before you even turn around
'Cause I got something to get off my lips
And I know you know what it is
No sense in making this worse
I'll say it first
Oh, I'll say it first
You know, I'll say it first
I'll say it first
I'll say it first
