Song Name: Creeps
I don't need your love
I don't need your sympathy
I don't need your heart
I just need some sober sleep
Keep me in the dark
When you've been lying next to me
Sleepin' on the secrets you keep
Yeah, that shit gives me the creeps
La la la la-la, la la la la-la
La la la la-la, la la la la-la
You only call me when you need somethin'
I guess that I'll take it whenever I can
Your beauty and desire to make nobody speak is a trap
And no one likes that
I don't need your love
I don't need your sympathy
I don't need your heart
I just need some sober sleep
Keep me in the dark
When you've been lying next to me
Sleepin' on the secrets you keep
Yeah, that shit gives me the creeps
La la la la-la, la la la la-la (that shit gives me the creeps)
La la la la-la, la la la la-la
It takes a lot for me to get freaked out
But lately I've been living in your haunted house
You're stunning and gorgeous
But your heart is the ugliest thing
That I've ever seen
Bitch, I don't need your love
I don't need your sympathy
I don't need your heart
I just need some sober sleep
Keep me in the dark
When you've been lying next to me
Sleepin' on the secrets you keep
Yeah, that shit gives me the creeps
La la la la-la, la la la la-la (that shit gives me the creeps)
La la la la-la, la la la la-la
'Cause I don't need your love
I don't need your sympathy
I don't need your heart
I just need some fuckin' sleep
Keep me in the dark
When you've been lying next to me
Sleepin' on the secrets you keep
Yeah, that shit gives me the creeps
La la la la-la, la la la la-la (yeah, that shit gives me the creeps)
La la la la-la, la la la la-la (yeah, that shit gives me the creeps)
La la la la-la, la la la la-la (gives me the creeps, gives me the creeps)
La la la la-la, la la la la-la
