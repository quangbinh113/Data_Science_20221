Song Name: Here You Come Again
Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wondering how I came to doubt you
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing up my mind and filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body has a right to
And shaking me up so, that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing up my mind and filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body has a right to
And shaking me up so, that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
