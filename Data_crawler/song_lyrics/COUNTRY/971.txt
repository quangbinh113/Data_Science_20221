Song Name: Run of Good Luck
Honey are you doing okay
I feel like a shadow of a man
Yes them oil field rigs just finally did me in
I got no expectations, life just gets in the way
So why don't we just roll the dice and head down the interstate?
Ain't you tired of this town?
Life just seems to sink into the ground
We were born to be better than this worn-out steel and leather
Pack your bag, Maria
Throw 'em in the trunk
I think it's time we roll the dice and hope for a run of good luck
Look at you, Maria
Staring out into the wind
Thinking if you've never left might be as big as a sin
There was a time when all of the light
Of the streets couldn't hold your dreams
Come on baby let's roll the dice and get the hell out of Abilene
And it's raining in this town
Life just seems to sink into the ground
We were born to be better than this worn-out steel and leather
Pack your bag, Maria
Throw 'em in the trunk
I think it's time we roll the dice and hope for a run of good luck
What'd you got to lose anyway?
Don't you think it's time
Don't you think it's time to get away?
Burn out of this town
Pull ourselves back onto solid ground
We were born to be better than this worn-out steel and leather
So ride with me, Maria
Blow out like the dust
Ain't it time to roll the dice and hope for a run of good luck
Ain't it time to roll the dice and hope for a run of good luck
