Song Name: Rose Colored Glasses
I don't know why I keep on believing you need me
When you've proved so many times that it ain't true
And I can't find one good reason for staying
Maybe by leaving would be the best for you
But these rose colored glasses
That I'm looking through
Show only the beauty
'Cause they hide all the truth

And they let me hold on to the good times, good lines
The ones I used to hear when I held you
And they keep me from feeling so cheated, defeated
When reflections in your eyes show me a fool

These rose colored glasses
That I'm looking through
Show only the beauty
'Cause they hide all the truth

So I just keep on hopin', believin'
That maybe by counting the many times that I've tried
You'll believe me when I say, "I love you"
And I'll lay these rose colored glasses aside
These rose colored glasses
That I'm looking through
Show only the beauty
'Cause they hide all the truth
