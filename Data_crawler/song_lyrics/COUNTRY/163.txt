Song Name: Chasin' You
We used to chase that Chattanooga fray
Couple a kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple lamp
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about L.A
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as guitar town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better
Haven't given' up, I'm just on your radio
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you
