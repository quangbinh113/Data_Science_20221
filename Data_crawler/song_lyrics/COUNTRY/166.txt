Song Name: Somethin' Bad (with Carrie Underwood) - Duet with Carrie Underwood [Album]
Stand on the box
Stomp your feet
Start clappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Oh!
Pulled up to the church
But I got signed up, had to bag it all up
Couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Oh!
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down the window, where you headin' miss
Say I'm headin' to the bar, with my money out the mattress
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Oh!
Stand on the box
Stomp your feet
Start clappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Drinks keep comin', throw my head back laughin'
Wake up in the mornin', don't know what happened
Oh, somethin' bad
Oh, somethin' bad
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We rollin' than the go down to the New Orleans
Got full tank gas and the money out the mattress
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Oh!
'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
'Cause I locked it real locked
Now I am the wiz
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call the kid nappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Oh!
Stand on the box
Stomp your feet
Start clappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Drinks keep comin', throw my head back laughin'
Wake up in the mornin', don't know what happened
Oh, somethin' bad
Oh, somethin' bad
Stand on the box
Stomp your feet
Start clappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad is 'bout to happen
Drinks keep comin', throw my head back laughin'
Wake up in the mornin', don't know what happened
Oh, somethin' bad
Oh, somethin' bad
