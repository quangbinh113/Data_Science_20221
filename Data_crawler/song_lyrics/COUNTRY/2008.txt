Song Name: Never Change
(I'm still the same broke boy in boot cut blue jeans)
Couple chains hangin' off me like a porch swing
And I keep my circle smaller than a skoal ring
I rather put four wheels on two lanes
And live life real slow like I'm on lean
Still drivin' dirt roads on demon time
Still reppin' my side of the county line
Still smile when I see that welcome sign
Still ten toes down when I ride for mine
I ain't never gonna change
Blue-collar blood runnin' through my veins
I ain't never gonna stop
I'ma be in these pines 'til I'm in a pine box
I'on care what ya think, it is what it is
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
It's how I was brought up, and I'm stuck in my ways
And I ain't never gonna change
Lotta folks need understandin' on the way I was raised
I grew up in the dirt but don't throw it on my name
Yeah, I been working like a dog
'Cause my kin, all did it this way
The city ain't got enough green for me
Ain't got the kinda stars that I'm tryna see
Ain't got nothin' else that I'm tryna be
I'm still the same broke boy in boot cut blue jeans
I ain't never gonna change
Blue-collar blood runnin' through my veins
I ain't never gonna stop
I'ma be in these pines 'til I'm in a pine box
I'on care what ya think, it is what it is
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
It's how I was brought up, and I'm stuck in my ways
And I ain't never gonna change
Never gonna change
I ain't never gonna change
Blue-collar blood runnin' through my veins
I ain't never gonna stop
I'ma be in these pines 'til I'm in a pine box
I'on care what ya think, it is what it is
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
It's how I was brought up, and I'm stuck in my ways
And I ain't never gonna change
