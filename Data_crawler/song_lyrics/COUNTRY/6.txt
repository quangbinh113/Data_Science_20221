Song Name: How Can I Tell Her
She knows when I'm lonesome
She cries when I'm sad
She's up in the good times
She' s down in the bad
Whenever I'm discouraged
She knows just what to do
But girl, she doesn't know about you
I can tell her my troubles
She makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses

Not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow
I'll tell her things that I want to do
But girl, how can I tell her about you?
How can I tell her about you?
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
Whenever I'm with you
So girl, won't you tell me
How to tell her about you?
How can I tell her I don't miss her
Whenever I'm away?
How can I say it's you and I think of
Every single night and day?
But when is it easy
Telling someone we're through?
Oh, girl, help me tell her about you
How can I tell her about you?
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
Whenever I'm with you
So girl, won't you tell me
How to tell her about you?
