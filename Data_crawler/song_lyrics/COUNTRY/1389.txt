Song Name: Trucks Don't Lie
It ain't even two years old, barely got 10K on it
There ain't a thing I wish I could change on it
Thought I'd keep it and drive it to the ground
No, I don't even wanna drive it around
That leather still smells like your daisy perfume
All I see in the shotgun view
Is your feet on the dash, hazel green eyes
You made it hard to stay between the lines
This four-by-four right here's for sale
Rides like heaven but it hurts like hell
Gets me from A to B
But it can't outrun your memory
Like every mile in it reminds me
Your goodbye ain't too far behind me
Wish I could bend the truth
Pretend that I ain't missing you
But trucks don't lie
Like the new one in your drive
Trucks don't lie, mmh
And that Giants frame 'round his license plate
Says we might've got along another time or place
But I hate that it looks like mine
It's been parked right there all night
Wish I could say I'm fine
But trucks don't lie
So this four-by-four right here's for sale
Rides like heaven but it hurts like hell
Gets me from A to B
But it can't outrun your memory
Like every mile in it reminds me
Your goodbye ain't too far behind me
Wish I could bend the truth
Pretend that I ain't missing you
But trucks don't lie
Like the new one in your drive
Trucks don't lie
Ooh, trucks don't lie
This four-by-four right here's for sale
Rides like heaven but it hurts like hell
Gets me from A to B
But it can't outrun your memory
Like every mile in it reminds me
Your goodbye ain't too far behind me
Wish I could bend the truth
Pretend that I ain't missing you
But trucks don't lie
Trucks don't lie
Like the new one in your drive
Trucks don't lie
Ooh
Trucks don't lie
Wish I could bend the truth
Say that he ain't there with you
Trucks don't lie
