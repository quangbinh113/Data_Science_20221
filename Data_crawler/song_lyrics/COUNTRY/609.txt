Song Name: What Mattered Most
I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad, I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
So if she's gone the fault is mine
I know, I know
A whole lot of little things
And even though
I could list them 1 by 1
She would still be gone
Her eyes are blue, her hair was long
'64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is 'In My Life'
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
But I paid no attention to what mattered most
I never ask, she never said
And when she cried, I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams, behind closed doors
And that made them easy to ignore
And I know, I know
I missed the forest full of trees
And all I have to show
Oh, but she walked out of the door
Cold facts and nothing more
Her eyes are blue, her hair was long
'64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is 'In My Life'
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
But I paid no attention to what mattered most
Her eyes are blue, her hair was long
'64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her fathers tall, her mothers gone
She moved out west when she was 2
The way she laughed, the way she loved
Oh my God, what did I do?
[Incomprehensible] attention
[Incomprehensible] attention
