Song Name: Throw It Back (feat. Keith Urban)
If she get a shot of whiskey, she know how to throw it back
She turn up for Elvis Presley, told the DJ, "Throw it back"
She look better every Thursday, she don't have to throw it back
Shawty got me catching feelings, I just hope she throw it back
Throw it, throw it back
Drop it low, you can blame it on the Jack, ayy
Slow it down, girl, I'm tryna make it last, ayy
If you sexy and you know it, make it clap
Throw it, throw it, throw it back
I threw it on back
Nothing says summer like the way she make me feel (feel)
A tall glass of natural woman
I can tell that she keep it real (she keep it real, yeah)
A green light
She'll give it to you, gotta get it 'fore it turn red (ooh-hoo)
Hotter than a flame
I barely know her name, but I'm damn sure willing to bet (yeah)
If she get a shot of whiskey, she know how to throw it back
She turn up for Elvis Presley, told the DJ, "Throw it back"
She look better every Thursday, she don't have to throw it back
Shawty got me catching feelings, I just hope she throw it back
Throw it, throw it back
Drop it low, you can blame it on the Jack, ayy
Slow it down, girl, I'm tryna make it last, ayy
If you sexy and you know it, make it clap
Throw it, throw it
Better thank Jesus, making them peaches
Georgia Bulldog got me SEC-sick
She on that wave and I'm deep in
Tryna buy another round (throw it back)
Let me see the levee-breakin' Chevy, super heavy-duty
Toot-toot for the dude-dude, babe
Bubble-bubble, you been eating your McDoubles
And it's trouble for me
If she get a shot of whiskey, she know how to throw it back
She turn up for Elvis Presley, told the DJ, "Throw it back"
She look better every Thursday, she don't have to throw it back
Shawty got me catching feelings, I just hope she throw it back
Throw it, throw it back
Drop it low, you can blame it on the Jack, ayy
Slow it down, girl, I'm tryna make it last, ayy
If you sexy and you know it, make it clap
Throw it, throw it, throw it back (do it to 'em, Keith)
If she get a shot of whiskey, she know how to throw it back
She turn up for Elvis Presley, told the DJ, "Throw it back" (throw it back)
She look better every Thursday, she don't have to throw it back
Shawty got me catching feelings, I just hope she throw it back (hmm, won't you)
Throw it, throw it back
Drop it low, you can blame it on the Jack, ayy
Slow it down, girl, I'm tryna make it last, ayy
If you sexy and you know it, make it clap
Throw it, throw it
Throw it back
Drop it low, you can blame it on the Jack (on the Jack)
Slow it down, girl, I'm tryna make it last, ayy
If you sexy and you know it, make it clap
Throw it, throw it, throw it back
