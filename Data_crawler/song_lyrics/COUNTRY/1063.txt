Song Name: I Love You, I Honestly Love You
Maybe I hang around here a little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you that I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know
I love you
I honestly love you
You don't have to answer, I see it in your eyes
Maybe, it's better left unsaid
This is pure and simple and you must realize
That it's coming from my heart, and not my head
I love you
I honestly love you
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along every day
And I shouldn't blow my chance
When you've got the chance to say
I love you
I love you
I honestly love you
If we both were born in another place in time
This moment might be ending with a kiss
There you are with yours and here I am with mine
So, I guess, we'll just be leaving it at this
I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you
