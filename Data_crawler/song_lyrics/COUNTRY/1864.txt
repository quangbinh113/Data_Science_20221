Song Name: Redneck Woman
Well, I ain't never been the Barbie doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip
'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say, "hey ya'll" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah"
From the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy
Just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me
You might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say, "hey y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah"
From the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
And I say, "hey y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah"
From the redneck girls like me (Hell yeah)
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
I said hell yeah
