Song Name: If You See Him, If You See Her
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doing?
Well sometimes it's hard to tell
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word
If you see him
Oh, if you see him
If you see her
Tell her I'm doing fine
And if you want to say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders where we both went wrong?
If you see her
If you see her
Oh, I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh I don't know why we let each other go
If you see her
Tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him
And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here
If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her
