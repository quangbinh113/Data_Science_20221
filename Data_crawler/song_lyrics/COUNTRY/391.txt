Song Name: Beer For My Horses
Well, a man come on six o'clock news
Said, "Somebody been shot, somebody's been abused
Somebody blew up a building, somebody stole a car
Somebody got away, somebody didn't get too far"
Yeah, they didn't get too far
Grand pappy told my pappy "Back in my day son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he'd done"
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree
Round up all of them bad boys, hang them high in the street
For all the people to see
That justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against Evil forces singing
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
Too much corruption and crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send 'em all to their maker, and he'll settle 'em down
You can bet He'll set 'em down
'Cause justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
And we'll raise up our glasses against Evil forces singing
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
He knows justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
And we'll raise up our glasses against Evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
