Song Name: One Of Those
Are you one of them
Sittin' in the boat tryin' not to rock it
Or one of them that goes along just to get along
Only change you like
Is the kind in your blue-jean pocket
Keeps your two cents to yourself
Till the chance to speak up is gone
Or are you one of those
Don't back down for nothin'
One of those standing up strong for somethin'
Walkin' the walk even if you gotta walk it alone
Are you one of those?
One of those tough enough not to cave in
One of those ain't too proud to pray when
Shit hits the fan and the rubber hits the road
You better know before then
If you're gonna be one of them
Or one of those
Too many times I've been
One of them lookin' back regrettin'
(Regrettin', regrettin')
Who didn't do what I knew
I should have done at the time
Momma used to say
Boy you're better off over steppin
Than winding up one of them
Fenced in when they draw a line
Son, you gotta be
One of those don't back down for nothin'
One of those standing up strong for somethin'
Walkin' the walk even if you gotta walk it alone
Are you one of those
One of those tough enough not to cave in
One of those ain't too proud to pray when
Shit hits the fan and the rubber hits the road
You better know before then
If you're gonna be one of them
Or one of those
Don't fit, with no crowd
Who won't quit and he won't sell out
One of the few and far betweens
Who don't give a damn what it cost to be
One of those don't back down for nothin'
One of those standing up strong for somethin'
Walkin' the walk even if you gotta walk it alone
Are you one of those
One of those tough enough not to cave in
One of those ain't too proud to pray when
Shit hits the fan and the rubber hits the road
Yeah, you better know before then
If you're gonna be one of them
Some day when my time ends
I hope they can say that I was one of them
Or one of those
