Song Name: I Told You So
Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think
I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realize
You're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say
I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come
Crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again
If I got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling
Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I return
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the table's finally turned
Would you say I told you so
Oh I told you so
I told you someday you'd come
Crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again
