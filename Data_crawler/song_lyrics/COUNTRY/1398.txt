Song Name: Country Like You
I ain't ever seen country like you
I've seen back roads winding through Ohio
Seen a red collar man smokin' on a Marlboro
Yeah, I've seen a midnight holding onto a fishing line
Seen a last second touchdown game winning score
On a Friday night
I ain't never seen country like you
Girl you knocked me right off of my boots
Home made
Jesus saved
Dirt road raised
Yeah that's you
Wild as an untamed mustang
You hit my heart like a tin roof in the rain
And you're mine all mine
So I'll just enjoy the view
I ain't never seen country like you
I've bucked on a bronco
Them eight seconds
Go real slow held on for life
On that damn crazy ride
All I know is I ain't never seen country like you
Girl you knocked me
Right off of my boots
Home made
Jesus saved
Dirt road raised
Yeah that's you
Wild as an untamed mustang
You hit my heart like a tin roof in the rain
And you're mine all mine
So I'll just enjoy the view
I ain't never seen country like you
Country like you
I've seen Garth from the front row
I've heard him play thunder rolls
But with you by my side no, I can't lie
You steal the show
I ain't never seen country like you
Girl you knocked me right off of my boots
Home made
Jesus saved
Dirt road raised
Yeah that's you
Wild as an untamed mustang
You hit my heart like a tin roof in the rain
And you're mine all mine
So I'll just enjoy the view
Yeah girl
You knock me off my boots
I ain't never seen country like you
Never seen country like you
Never seen country like you
