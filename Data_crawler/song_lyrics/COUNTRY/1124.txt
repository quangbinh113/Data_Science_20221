Song Name: Things That Matter
I used to let it tear me up
When my boys lost a football game
And that dent in the bed of my truck
'Bout drove me half insane
Politics and the price of gas
Things I wanted that I don't have
I've learned to let 'em all go
'Cause the things that mean the most
Is wakin' up with the woman I love
Talkin' to the Man above
Sippin' coffee from my favorite cup
Slowin' down in the country
Going huntin' with my old man
Huggin' Mama while I still can
I think I finally understand
Life ain't about money
I'm gonna spend a little more time chasin' after
Things that matter
Things that matter
Gonna grab a beer with some friends of mine
Do a little makin' up for lost times
Laugh about them days gone by
In the mornin' you can bet that I'll be
Wakin' up with the woman I love
Talkin' to the Man above
Sippin' coffee from my favorite cup
Slowin' down in the country
Goin' huntin' with my old man
Huggin' Mama while I still can
I think I finally understand
Life ain't about money
I'm gonna spend a little more time chasin' after
Things that matter
Things that matter, yeah
Can't tell you what it was
Maybe, I just finally grew up
All I know is I just can't get enough
Of wakin' up with the woman I love
Talkin' to the Man above
Sippin' coffee from my favorite cup
Slowin' down in the country
Goin' huntin' with my old man
Huggin' Mama while I still can
I think I finally understand
Life ain't about money
I'm gonna spend a little more time chasin' after
Things that matter
Things that matter
Yeah, things that matter
Things that matter, yeah
