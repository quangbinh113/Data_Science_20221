Song Name: Take Me Home
We've been fighting this feeling for way too long
Lord, I know it ain't right, but it sure ain't wrong
And baby, you just feel like home
'Cause we been fighting this feeling
For way too long
Yeah
And I don't really care about what they say
You're know people gonna talk anyway
And some things do but good love don't fade
No, I don't give a damn about what they say
Take me home tonight
'Cause I'm way too damn drunk to drive
We can dance in the dark 'til we're feeling right
Oh darling, take me home tonight
And I know it's hard, I know it ain't fair
But I close my eyes and you're right there
It doesn't matter how far away I am
Babe, I know it's hard and I know it ain't fair
And I don't wanna run no more
'Cause I don't know what I'm running for
Baby please, open that door
'Cause I don't wanna run no more
Take me home tonight
'Cause I'm way too damn drunk to drive
We can dance in the dark 'til we're feeling right
Oh darling, take me home tonight
We got a baby on the way and a dog in the yard
Lord, we started off small but we sure came far
And I just wanna be where you are
We got a baby on the way and a dog in the yard
