Song Name: What Do I Know (feat. HARDY)
Work hard all day
Sleep hard all night
Don't run your mouth
If you don't know how to fight
Plan your work, man
And work your plan
Don't build your house in the sand
Carry a pocketknife
Stick to your guns
Know when to walk away
But don't ever run
Try not to borrow another man's gold
Gotta answer to the one you owe
These are the things I know
But what do I know?
I'm just a redneck sittin' on a screen-in
Sippin' on a longneck
Listenin' to the crickets sing the same old songs
Like my daddy's grandaddy's daddy's daddy did too
What do I know?
I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right here in my holler
Where ones that don't get it won't go
What do I know?
Say what you think
Think 'fore you speak
Don't kill nothin' that you ain't gonna eat
You learn from the dirt what the street can't teach
That backwood philosophy
Hell, it still means a lot to me
But what do I know?
I'm just a redneck sittin' on a screen-in
Sippin' on a longneck
Listenin' to the crickets sing the same old songs
Like my daddy's grandaddy's daddy's daddy did too
What do I know?
I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right here in the holler
Where ones that don't get it won't go
But what do I know?
I know wrong, I know right
I know right where I'll go when I die
But what do I know?
I'm just a redneck sittin' on a screen-in
Sippin' on a longneck
Listenin' to the crickets sing the same old songs
Like my daddy's grandaddy's daddy's daddy did too
What do I know?
I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right here in the holler
Where the ones that dont get it won't go
But what do I know?
Tell me, what do I know?
