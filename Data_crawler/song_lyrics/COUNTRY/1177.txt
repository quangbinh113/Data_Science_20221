Song Name: Huntin', Fishin' And Lovin' Every Day
Whoa, whoa, mmm
If I could make a livin' walkin' in the woods
You could bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in
A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin' and late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
I'd get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I back it up
And pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke
Murphy
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And we'd get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin' and late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
So, while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that dirty air
I'll be down here knee-deep in the Muckalee, uhm
Huntin', Fishin', Lovin' everyday
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
And let's go there in our minds
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin' and dark whiskey in the evenin'
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day, woo
Come on
Won't you come along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
I know you'll wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
