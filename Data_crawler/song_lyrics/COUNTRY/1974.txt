Song Name: the only
Maybe you're not the only one who's lonely
Just take a look around and you'll see
Stop looking down, there's friends around you think are strangers
Start with the heart is meant for giving
This life is meant for living
It's hard enough already just to survive the healing
Yeah, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Is if we hold each other's hand
If we hold each other, hold each other's hand
Hurting
Talk ourselves out of loving
The opposite we're craving
Then longing for relief that only love can bring
Yeah, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Is if we hold each other's hand
If we hold each other, hold each other's hand
Yeah, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Yes, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Is if we hold each other's hand
If we hold each other's, hold each other's hand
Yeah, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Is if we hold each other's hand
If we hold each other, hold
Yeah, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Oh, the only (the only, only way) way we're gonna get there
Is if we hold each other's hand
If we hold each other, hold each other's hand
Alright now
Only way to get there (only way to get there)
Only way to get there (only, only, only, only way)
Only way to get there (yeah now, yeah now)
Only way to get there (the only, only way)
Only way to get there (only way to get there)
Just take a look around and you'll see
Just take a look around and you'll see
Stop looking down, there's friends around you
Stop looking down, there's friends around you
Only way, it's the only way
Only way, only way, the only to get there (once I know, once I know)
Only way to get there (yeah now, yeah, now) (the only, only way)
Alright now (the only, only way)
(Amen)
