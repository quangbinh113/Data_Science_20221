Song Name: Own It
You wear that red lipstick like you invented it
Got them blue jean hips like God intended it
The little smile you get when you're rollin' up
To the free valet in your beat-up truck
Struttin' like you're stuntin' in a brand new whip
Girl, you own it
Whatever you touch turns gold
Everybody knows it
Somehow, I get to take you home and see you
Slippin' on your ripped-up college T-shirt, I bet
Victoria wishes she knew your secret
'Cause you just own it
My heart, my time, my lovе
You sip that cheap champagne and get to kissin' mе (champagne)
Ain't got expensive taste, but you sure make it sweet (make it sweet)
Play an OG song with the volume jacked
On an old iPhone with a screen that's cracked
Dancin' like we're private in the VIP
Girl, you own it
Whatever you touch turns gold
Everybody knows it
Somehow, I get to take you home and see you
Slippin' on your ripped-up college T-shirt, I bet
Victoria wishes she knew your secret
'Cause you just own it
My heart, my time, my love
You own it
You know how you make me want it
Yeah, you own it
Girl, what you want, you got it
Slippin' on your ripped-up college T-shirt
Victoria wishes she knew your secret
'Cause you just own it
Whatever you touch turns gold
Everybody knows it
Somehow, I get to take you home and see you
Slippin' on your ripped-up college T-shirt, I bet
Victoria wishes she knew your secret
'Cause you just own it
My heart, my time, my love
You just own it
Girl, you own it
