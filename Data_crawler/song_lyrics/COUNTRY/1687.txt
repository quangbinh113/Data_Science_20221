Song Name: Poster Child
Well, you make a hundred dollars and you shake a little coin
You pick her up in Dallas and you leave her in Des Moines
He's a mediocre maestro with his mutilated friends
He waits for his crescendo, but instead it all descends
He used to make it thunder, he used to make it rain
But now it's just the water as it dashes down the drain
When the dog gets hungry, well, he gets a little riled
But we haven't seen a sign of the poster child
Hey (Hey)
Hey, he's already gone
Hey (Hey)
Hey, the damage is done
What was it that she told you back when everything was loud
When the luster of the spotlight met the clamber of the crowd?
She said, "I always fall in love with those that never seem to try"
As she sucked down another shot of Canada Dry
The hands meet the midnight on a suicide watch
And the stock on the rifle gets another little notch
He's a sucker for salvation, but when hope is running wild
There's nothing left but headlines for the poster child
Hey (Hey)
Hey, he's already gone
Hey (Hey)
Hey, the damage is done
Hey (Hey)
Hey, he's already gone
Hey (Hey)
Hey, the damage is done
