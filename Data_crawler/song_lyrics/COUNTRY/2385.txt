Song Name: Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes
Tongue-tied
But now, you're so far away, and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I, I, I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
These days, I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter, disaster
'Cause now you're so far away, and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I, I, I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
How is it in London? (London)
Where are you while I'm wondering (wondering)
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love, mmm-mmm
And now I'm standing here, hoping it gets to you
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I, I, I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (I can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love, my love
And now I'm standing here, hoping this gets to you
