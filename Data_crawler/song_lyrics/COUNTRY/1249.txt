Song Name: Rock and A Hard Place - Acoustic
We've been swinging and missing
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixing
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissing
It's just different
We've been talking about forever since we've been together
Something 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this, but we're caught in-between
A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
And damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell is this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel takes some effort
So I'd rather ride it out for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
And damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell is this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
We've been talking about forever since we've been together
Something 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this, but we're caught in-between
A rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your face
As I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
And damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell is this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?
