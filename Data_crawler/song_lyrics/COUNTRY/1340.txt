Song Name: That Drink (feat. Neal McCoy)
You add a little whiskey, then you add a little more
Tip the bartender, so she's heavy on the pour
Add a couple cold rocks, then you rock the dance floor
'Til your achy breaky heart ain't breakin' no more
Hot damn, I'm about to unwind
Get these two left feet in a George Strait line
Throw my card on the bar, shoot a pretty girl a wink
All you gotta do is just give me that drink
Bubba shot the jukebox, so fire up the band
Howlin' David Lee Murphy with a drink in each hand
Won't be Brooks and Dunn when they shut down the bar
We'll be country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Hot damn, I'm about to unwind
Get these two left feet in a George Strait line
Throw my card on the bar, shoot a pretty girl a wink
All you gotta do is just give me that drink
Yeah, I'm the life of the party, the real deal McCoy
A country gold singin' old school cowboy
If I'm too hung over to show up for work
I'll just flip that boss man this here Tracy Byrd (come on, Neal)
Hot damn, I'm about to unwind
Get these two left feet in a George Strait line
Throw my card on the bar, shoot a pretty girl a wink
All you gotta do is just give me that drink
Hot damn, I'm about to unwind (woo)
Get these two left feet in a George Strait line (that's right)
Throw my card on the bar, shoot a pretty girl a wink (I know 'bout that)
All you gotta do is just give me that drink
Not another one
Yes, sir
Ain't no way I can do it, man
Oh, Neal, go 'head
Show 'em how it's done, cowboy
All you gotta do is just give me that wink
