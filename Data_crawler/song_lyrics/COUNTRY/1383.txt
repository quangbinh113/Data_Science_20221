Song Name: Big Wheels
You know how we roll it up like
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Old school, straight country gold here
That's just the way that we roll here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Green heads, white tails and long beards
Long johns, jon boats and John Deere
We stick to shit that we know here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
To get inside, you gotta jump
We goin' green handle at the pump
And you can hear us before we rollin' up
If it's like that where you're from
Come on and say
Big wheels, backroads, and cold beer
Old school, straight country gold here
That's just the way that we roll here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Green heads, white tails and long beards
Long johns, jon boats and John Deere
We stick to shit that we know here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
22s and 33s, yeah
Outside dirty, inside clean
We all drinkin' Natty like it's lean
Holla back if you know what I mean, yeah
Cuz we rollin', we rollin', we rollin' it all night
We go and we go and we go at it all night
In them out skirt, skirts and we all about that life
If you're raised that way, y'all raise 'em up high for
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Old school, straight country gold here
Daddy's farm, it ain't gettin' sold here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Green heads, white tails and long beards
Long johns, jon boats and John Deere
We stick to shit that we know here
Big wheels, backroads and cold beer
Aw yeah, big wheels, backroads and cold beer
