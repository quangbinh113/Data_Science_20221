Song Name: Ain't Much Left of Me
Well my fall from grace was a sight to see
Good turned to bad and bad turned to misery
I found out what it is and what it's not
And all I ask for sure ain't what I got, no
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see, no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me
Thought that I hit bottom but I ain't there yet
'Cause you'd be surprised of how low a man can get
I watched stolen dreams slip through my hands
And now I'm getting out of here still while I still can
Well I've neen rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see,no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me
That's right
Well my fall from grace was a sight to see
Nobody even cared what became of me
Do I have to get down on my knees
And ask the Lord, Lord have mercy on me
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see, no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me
There ain't much left of me
I said there ain't much left of me,no
Yeah well there ain't much left of me
