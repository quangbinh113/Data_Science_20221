Song Name: Tulsa Time
I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine
My baby said I was crazy
My mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no foolin'
And I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well, you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well, there I was in Hollywood
Wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just a wastin' time
Well, then I got to thinkin'
Man, I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin'
And nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I've been through
Livin' on Tulsa time
