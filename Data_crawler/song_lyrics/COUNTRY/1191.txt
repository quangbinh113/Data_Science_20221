Song Name: Change
Too little, too late
The wind cries can't make you stay
Blue eyes drowning out the flame
And red lights crashing at your name
Flashbacks and memories
Shatter like glass into you and me
Now I'm tryna find a life with meaning
Picking up the pieces
'Cause I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
('Cause I'm tired of being broken)
Your shadow that goes to blame
Chasing me down, it won't fade away
If having everything means leaving
Then baby you're the reason
That I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
'Cause I'm tired of being broken
Living in a home with a heart so hopeless
While you're crying, I'm trying
Everything I can
And I'm tired of being so close
Living in a world where I want to let go
Take my pain with your name
And throw it all away
'Cause everything we were yesterday
Is everything I wanna change
('Cause I'm tired of being so close)
Change (living in a world where I want to let go)
('Cause I'm tired of being broken)
