Song Name: breadwinner
Here's what he'll do
He'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm telling you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you
I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm telling you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you
I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine
That he wants a (breadwinner)
(He wants your dinner)
(Until he ain't hungry anymore) anymore
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you
With a woman like you and me
He likes what he sees
