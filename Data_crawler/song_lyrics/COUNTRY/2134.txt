Song Name: Happier Alone (feat. Koe Wetzel)
Do you ever turn the lights down?
Do you ever dance alone?
Do you wish that I was somehow, someway, somewhere
Closer to home?
Does it ever cross your mind?
You could be happy alone
Instead of always waiting, pacing, saying
"I love you" through the phone.
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
You never asked me why
I always hated to fight
I even think it was necessary to be so angry
When you told me everything was alright
You could sit there and pretend
That we worked out in the end
But the truth is that me leaving is better than believing
That I could ever love again
I could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
I could be happier alone
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
You could be happier
You could be happier
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
