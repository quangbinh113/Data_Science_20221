Song Name: 500 Miles Away from Home
I'm 500 miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said, "We miss you son, we love you, come on home"
Well, I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm 500 miles away from home
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home
But it sure looks different now
Well, I guess I look different too
'Cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say
When they see their boy looking this way
Oh, I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still 500 miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still 500 miles away from home
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm still 500 miles away from home
Ho, I'm still 500 miles away from home
