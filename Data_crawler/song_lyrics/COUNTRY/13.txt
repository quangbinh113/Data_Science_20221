Song Name: Ho Hey
(Ho!)
(Hey!)
(Ho!)
(Hey!)
(Ho!) I've been tryin' to do it right
(Hey!) I've been livin' a lonely life
(Ho!) I've been sleepin' here instead
(Hey!) I've been sleepin' in my bed
(Ho!) Sleepin' in my bed
(Hey!)
(Ho!)
(Ho!) So show me family
(Hey!) All the blood that I will bleed
(Ho!) I don't know where I belong
(Hey!) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho!) But I can write a song
(Hey!) Two, three
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet-
(Ho!)
(Hey!) (Come on, now)
(Ho!) (Hey)
(Hey!)
(Ho!) I don't think you're right for him
(Hey!) Think of what it might've been if we
(Ho!) Took a bus to Chinatown
(Hey!) I'd be standin' on Canal
(Ho!) And Bowery
(Hey!) Hey
(Ho!) She'd be standin' next to me
(Hey!) Two, three
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
(Ho!)
(Hey!)
(Ho!) (Last one)
(Hey!)
