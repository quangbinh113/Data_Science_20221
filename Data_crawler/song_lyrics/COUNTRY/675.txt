Song Name: Bluebird
Yeah, I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34 was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah, I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep bluebird in my heart
Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I've made an art
Out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a ten
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I'll rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll turn the light on in my soul
And keep the bluebird in my heart
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart
And the bluebird sings
