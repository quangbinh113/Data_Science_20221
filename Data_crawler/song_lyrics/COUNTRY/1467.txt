Song Name: When Love Comes Around
If I were magic
You'd be mystery
We'd keep em on the edge of their seats
If I were a Gibson
You'd be a sweet song
Always bringing the best out of me
Every song I sing
Gotta rise when the rain comes down
Gotta dance when the band's downtown
Gotta get lost to get found
Gotta love when love comes around
If you were Memphis
I'd be Elvis
Every day I'd buy you a cadillac
If you were starlight
I'd be the midnight
We'd drift away like morning ain't coming back
Yeah so shine on baby
Gotta rise when the rain comes down
Gotta dance when the band's downtown
Gotta get lost to get found
Gotta love when love comes around
When your love comes around
Gonna wrap my arms around you baby
Gotta pull you close
Gonna hold you when this world gets crazy
Never let you go
Honey you're my proof of Heaven
My paradise found
Yeah I believe in everything
When your love comes around
Gotta rise when the rain comes down
Gotta dance when the band's downtown
Gotta get lost to get found
Gotta love, gotta love, yeah
Gotta rise when the rain comes down
Gotta dance when the band's downtown
Gotta get lost to get found
Gotta love when love comes around
Gotta love when love comes around
Yeah I love when your love comes around
If I were magic
You'd be mystery
Yeah we'd keep em on the edge of their seats
