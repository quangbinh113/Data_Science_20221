Song Name: Should've Been A Cowboy
I bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away?
Settling' down, would you marry me?
If I ask you twice and beg you pretty please?"
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it, he just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place
I should've been a cowboy, I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs, oh, I should've been a cowboy
I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told?
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' out all night 'neath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart
I should've been a cowboy, I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs, oh, I should've been a cowboy
I should've been a cowboy, I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs, oh, I should've been a cowboy
Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should've been a cowboy
