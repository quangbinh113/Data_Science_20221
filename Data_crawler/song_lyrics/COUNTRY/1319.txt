Song Name: Just About Over You - Acoustic Version
I've stopped looking for your truck
Every time I go somewhere
I don't scroll through the past anymore 'cause I don't care
I'm finally putting on the shirt I like
Tight jeans, big hoops with my hair up high
The least you could've done was give me the bar tonight
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone?
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past two, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you
I was just about, just about over you
You could've stayed with the guys, acting like you didn't see me
It would've hurt a little less if you'd bought some girl a drink
But you had to walk up, messing me up
I'm drunk, wondering why it's gotta be like this
I thought that I was moving on, but now I'm starting back over again
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past two, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you
I was just about, just about over you
Maybe you caught me on a bad night
Maybe tomorrow I'll be just fine
Maybe it's the red wine
That put you back in my mind
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone?
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past two, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you, oh, oh
I was just about over you
