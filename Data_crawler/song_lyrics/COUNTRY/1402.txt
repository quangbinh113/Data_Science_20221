Song Name: Technicolor
I couldn't tell you
The shade of Chevrolet my grandpa drove
The walls of my bedroom at ten years old
It all just kinda fades the more time goes
And it goes
And I don't remember
The colors of my hometown
Rival football team
The tie I wore to prom
When I was seventeen
It's kinda crazy how some memories
Through the years
Just disappear
But girl when I see blue
It takes me to a sky
That was turning red
Like that dress you were wearing
I can paint the scene
You're eyes were delta green
Kissing you kissing me babe
When we had each other
It's still in technicolor
Yeah I remember
That bar we ducked into
'Cause it was raining
That neon light that framed you
Like a painting
That cherry in your drink
Your lipstick on my cheek
Left a mark on me
Now when I see blue
It takes me to a sky
That was turning red
Like that dress you were wearing
I can paint the scene
You're eyes were delta green
Kissing you kissing me babe
When we had each other
It's still in technicolor
So in technicolor
I don't know what you see
When you think of me
Where your mind goes
But girl I hope
Whenever you see blue
It takes me to a sky
That was turning red
Like that dress you were wearing
'Cause I can paint the scene
You're eyes were delta green
Kissing you kissing me babe
When we had each other
It's still in technicolor
So in technicolor
Back when we had each other
It's still in technicolor, mmh
