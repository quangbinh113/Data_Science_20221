Song Name: Caught Me at a Good Time
You caught me at a good time
Honey, I'm a goldmine
Got a pocket full of twenties
No way in hell we're gonna go to sleep
Well, you caught me in a good mood
Badass attitude
Every day is sunshine
You caught me at a good time
Honey, you and me go good together
You're the prettiest woman I've ever seen, ever
Ever think about the backslide
Slipping into midnight
Get a little alright
Light a little candlelight
You caught me at a good time
Honey, I'm a goldmine
Got a pocket full of hell yeah
Why not? Might as well, yeah
Well, you caught me in a good mood
A badass attitude
Every day is sunshine
Well, you caught me at a good time
The way you move them hips is hypnotizing
Honey, take my hand, let's make some lovin'
Ever think about the backslide?
Slipping into midnight
Get a little more right
Flyin' higher than the sky
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a good time
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a good time
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a good time
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a
Oh, you caught me at a good time
Well, you caught me at a good time
Honey, I'm a goldmine
Got a pocket full of hell yeah
Why not? Might as well, yeah
Well, you caught me in a good mood
A badass attitude
Every day is sunshine
You caught me at a good time
