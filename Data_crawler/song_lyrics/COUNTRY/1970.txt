Song Name: Only You Know
My brain's like a hurricane
Thoughts spinning around in my head
Thinking maybe you'd be waving from the distance
You're the only way I'm gonna make my way through this
Old memories they come and go
Like a bull in a rodeo ring
And I'm standing in the sand
With a lowered red flag
Waiting on you to come charging right back
I'm kicking up dust in the wind
I'm gonna start shaking your shadow
Only you know where I've been
Only you know
Only you know
I'm sick of all the wasted time
Thinking you'd come back and be mine
Everyday your face gets a little more hazy
Pretty clear staying here ain't gonna save me
I'm kicking up dust in the wind
I'm gonna start shaking your shadow
Only you know where I've been
Only you know
Only you know
So I'm picking back up again
I'm learning how to let you go
Only you know where I've been
Only you know
Only you know
I'm kicking up dust in the wind
I'm gonna start shaking your shadow
Only you know where I've been
Only you know
Only you know
So I'm picking back up again
I'm learning how to let you go
Only you know where I've been
Only you know
Only you know
