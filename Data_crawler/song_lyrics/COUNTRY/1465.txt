Song Name: Jacket On
Ring on my phone
A knock on my door
A kiss on a wine glass
A dress on the floor
Her lips on my lips and my hands on her waist
Blonde hair falling on my pillowcase
She ain't the kind of girl who'd tell a lie
And she meant for good when she told me goodbye
She said hell would freeze over 'fore she ever came home
I guess the devil's got his jacket on
Maybe she got lonely
Maybe she got drunk
Maybe she got tired of missing what she thought she could givе up
Well, it couldn't get much hotter up hеre in this bed tonight
While the man downstairs is watchin' all this fire turn to ice
She ain't the kind of girl who'd tell a lie
And she meant for good when she told me goodbye
She said hell would freeze over 'fore she ever came home
Guess the devil's got his jacket on
Yeah, she's the kind of girl who won't waste her breath
'Cause she says what she means
And she means what she says
She said hell would freeze over 'fore she ever came home
I guess the devil's got his jacket on
She said hell would freeze over 'fore she ever came home
I guess the devil's got his jacket on
