Song Name: Dust On The Bottle
Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said
"Can you help me, Creole?"
I got a little girl waitin' on me and I wanna treat her right
He said "I got what you need, son"
As we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs
As he turned on the light and said
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
You were sittin' in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My ole heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky
I reached under the front seat and said
"Now here's something special"
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
You're still with me and we've made some memories
After all these years there's one thing I've found
Some say good love, well it's like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
Don't let it fool ya...
