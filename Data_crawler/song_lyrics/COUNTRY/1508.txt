Song Name: Pretty Things
You said that I drank too much
The tattoos on my skin are not your style
And you didn't like cigarettes on my kiss
Well, I hope that's something you miss
'Cause I'm not slowing down for awhile
I've been desperate to fix what we've been
But some things need to stay broken
Realized you're not worth me trying to hide
'Cause baby you don't own me
You never could control me
The road you're on looks lonely
And I hope like hell it is
'Cause I'm never gonna be
Your southern Texas wannabe beauty queen
And I'm never gonna be
Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream
I know I'm more than just the pretty things
And that's alright by me, yeah
Wanted you so bad that I couldn't see
The truth was sitting there in front of me
It's never love, it was never real
You wanted something to fix, not something to feel
But I am not your accessory
I am not a Marie Annette for your passenger seat
A lesson learned and now I'm free
Well, your green eyes look like shit to me
'Cause baby you don't own me
You never could control me
The road you're on looks lonely
And I hope like hell it is
'Cause I'm never gonna be
Your southern Texas wannabe beauty queen
And I'm never gonna be
Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream
I know I'm more than just the pretty things
And that's alright by me
So won't you go on and marry that lady
Wears Louis Vuitton, drives around in her Mercedes
Says, "Downtown Dallas is the place to be"
Daddy gave her everything that she's got for free
She looks real good with her head down low
Always minds her business in your shadow
Kisses your ass like you wanted me to
Well, good luck, honey, he's all for you
'Cause baby you don't own me
You never could control me
The road you're on looks lonely
And I hope like hell it is
'Cause I'm never gonna be
Your southern Texas wannabe beauty queen
And I'm never gonna be
Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream
I know I'm more than just the pretty things
And that's alright by me, yeah
That's alright by me
