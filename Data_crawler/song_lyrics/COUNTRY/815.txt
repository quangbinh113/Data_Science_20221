Song Name: I Don't Remember Me (Before You)
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home?
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone
I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waiting for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures and I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know what I was living without?
Who were all my favourite songs about?
I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waiting for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures and I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
Was my heart beating in my chest?
Was I even alive before the day we met?
I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waiting for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures and I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No I don't remember me before you
