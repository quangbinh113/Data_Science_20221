Song Name: A Higher Place
I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town
Everyone I meet seems so uptight wearing their frown
What good's living where dreams come true if nobody smiles?
Everyone's chasing the latest star, the latest style
You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place
So I'm, I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this all wrong
That's the dream to sing, the perfect girl, the perfect song
All I know is I can't keep on wearing this disguise
When you're the only one that sees what's real in my eyes
You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place
So I'm, I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
You take me to another place
You take me to another place
You take me to a higher place
Oh, yeah
You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place
So I'm, I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
So I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
