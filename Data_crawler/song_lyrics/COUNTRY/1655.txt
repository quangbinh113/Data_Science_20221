Song Name: That's How Love Is Made
Can't like you in the morning
Love you at night
Can't hate all your wrongs
And only want all your rights
Can't treat you like a stranger
When you ain't around
Treat you like a lover
We're out on the town
'Cause that ain't how love is made
That ain't how love is made
It's all or nothing
Gotta give to get something
That's what it takes
That's how love is made
Can't say I'm tired
When I don't ask for help
Can't want from you Heaven
Giving you hell
'Cause that ain't how love is made
That ain't how love is made
It's all or nothing
Gotta give to get something
That's what it takes
That's how love is made
There's will be sorrys
Most of the time
We'll see the sunshine
As long as every cloudy day
And heartbreak
Will always stay
And never say goodbye
That ain't how love is made
That ain't how love is made
I want all or nothing
Gotta give to get something
Oh, that's what it takes
Yeah, that ain't how love is made
That ain't how love is made
I want all or nothing
Oh, gotta give to get something
That's what it takes
That's how love
That's how love is made
