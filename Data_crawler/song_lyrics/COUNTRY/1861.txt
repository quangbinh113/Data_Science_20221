Song Name: Beer With My Friends (feat. Cole Swindell and David Lee Murphy)
Hit it Murph
Woo
David Lee, Cole Swindell
Shy Carter, baby
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Pop a top or two and talk about way back when
It's been too long, no matter how long it's been
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Don't get me wrong, I try to keep my heart right
I talk to Jesus just about every night
I call my mama and my daddy 'least once a week
To remember my roots and keep 'em planted deep
Sometimes I need to slip away and get a different view
There's really something to that honky tonk attitude
It pulls me out of that everyday sinking sand
But I feel better with a cold one in my hand
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Pop a top or two and talk about way back when
With some folks that seen me through thick and thin
Start seeing life through a rose-colored neon lens
We're gonna get that old jukebox working hard
Before it's over, I'll know everybody in this bar
It's been too long, no matter how long it's been
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
I got my brother and my sisters all here with me
In the glow of that 90 high-def TV
After I work my poor fingers down to the bone
Last thing I wanna do is go home and drink alone
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Pop a top or two and talk about way back when
With some folks that seen me through thick and thin
Start seeing life through a rose colored neon lens
We're gonna get that old jukebox working hard
Before it's over, I'll know everybody in this bar
It's been too long, no matter how long it's been
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Who knows where this little good time is gonna end
Might shoot tequila or have us some juice and gin
Tomorrow night we're gonna do it all over again
Right now I really need a beer with my friends
Oh, yeah (yeah)
Go
Yeah, baby
