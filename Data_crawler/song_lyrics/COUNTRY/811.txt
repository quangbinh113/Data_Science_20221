Song Name: The Rest of Our Life
Sittin' with you in a dark room
Warm by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day uum uum
I got something to run past you

I just hope I say it right

So I take your hand and ask you

Have you made plans for the rest of your life?
There's one thing I should be givin" up, givin' up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, i'll be fine
If my waistline goes, i'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lite
I've been makin' plans for children
Since I've been lookin' in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter; it'd be Rose
Son; it'd be Ron
There's one thing I should be givin' up, givin' up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our life
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewin'
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you we'll stay young for the rest of our life
