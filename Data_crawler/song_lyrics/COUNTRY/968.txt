Song Name: Louise
Me and Louise, we never had much luck
Just a couple of kids with a lot of love
Laid our fortunes on her daddy's old farm
We didn't see how dirt could do such harm
Seasons came, the seasons left
The only thing that changed was the shape of her dress
She said,
You're a good man, you'll have my child
Because you can't raise a living thing on this cursed old ground
We laid a sheet on the piano keys
Crying good Lord please, please
We packed our things into the old farm car
Wondering if it could take us very far
And I said
Everything about it takes a little luck
The gears rumble and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarentees
But there's gas in the tank, Louise
Out here on the borderline the sun sets low
Like a couple of jackrabbits dancing in the morning snow
We'd make it if we could just get out
The only thing we saw was love and sow(?)
The miles came and the miles went
Our hearts full our money spent
Somewhere outside El Paso my Louise cried out
She took my arm said it's time now
I prayed and waited all night
Oh Louise, please please
I heard a new voice with the new day
I thought back to what her daddy used to say
Everything about it takes a little luck
The gears rumble and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarentees
But there's gas in the tank Louise
The me and Louise we didn't go too far
Named our boy for Louise's pop
Found a plot of ground we could call our own
We built a house, we build a home
And we said
Everything about it takes a little luck
The gears rumble and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarentees
But there's gas in the tank
There's gas in the tank
Yeah, there's gas in the tank
Louiseee.
