Song Name: Little More Be Alright
Little more, little more, little more
Money in the bank, diesel in the tank
Hay in the bed, mouths gettin' fed
Little time off, little time for golf
But a little more be alright
Got sun on my face, on the river bank
Dirt on my cup, fish on the plug
Couple crappie in my cooler bag, just enough for supper
But a little more be alright
I'm a simple man, I don't need a lot
I'm good right here with what I got
But a little more, little more, little more be alright, hey
And I ain't tryin' to say I'm tryin' to have it all
And I ain't tryin' to live up higher on the hog
But a little more, little more, little more be alright
Forty acre lot, two car garage
His and hers sinks, girl of my dreams
With a tear in her eye, holdin' two pink lines
Guess a little more be alright
Now there's a boy with my name, princess with braids
Mama quit workin', got one on the way
And we're countin' on the Lord 'cause we got our hands full
But a little more be alright
I'm a simple man, I don't need a lot
I'm good right here with what I got
But a little more, little more, little more be alright, hey
And I ain't tryin' to say I'm tryin' to have it all
And I ain't tryin' to live up higher on the hog
But a little more, little more, little more be alright
Little more be alright
Sittin' out here with my dad on this dock
Droppin' a line, sippin' on a Light
And the doc said he didn't have much time
But God said a little more be alright
(Little more, little more, little more)
Mm-hmm, yeah
(Little more, little more, little more)
I'm a simple man, I don't need a lot
I'm good right here with what I got
But a little more, little more, little more be alright, hey
(Little more be alright)
And I ain't tryin' to say I'm tryin' to have it all
And I ain't tryin' to live up higher on the hog
But a little more, little more, little more be alright
Little more be alright
(Little more, little more, little more)
Little more be alright
(Little more, little more, little more)
Little more be alright
