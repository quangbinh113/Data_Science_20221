Song Name: Parallel
Don't say, you miss me
Or wish that I could come around
It hurts like a bee sting
Don't know if I can take it right now
I've been spending most my time away
But if home is where the heart is
Baby, I'm with you night and day
And the miles between our hearts
Got us feeling like living hell
And loving from afar is hard
But we do it well
Guess that's what chasing dreams will do
'Til I get back to you
We'll be living and loving and running in parallel
Strong as a rail line
Connected by the ties that bind
Alive like hot wires
Powering through space and time
I've been spending most my time away
But if home is where the heart is
Baby, I'm with you night and day
Though the miles between our hearts
Got us feeling like living hell
And loving from afar is hard
But we do it well
Guess that's what chasing dreams will do
'Til I get back to you
We'll be living and loving and running in parallel
And I cross my heart and hope to die
The day I find you by my side
I'll hold you close
I'll hold you close
The miles between our hearts
Are feeling like living hell
And loving from afar is hard
But we do it well
Guess that's what chasing dreams will do
'Til I get back to you
We'll be living and loving and running in parallel
Oh, running in parallel
Oh, running in parallel
Mhm, running in parallel
