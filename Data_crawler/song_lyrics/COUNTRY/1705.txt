Song Name: Will You
How can I tell you
That I was untrue
A secret burns inside me
That I just can't put you through
You're the one of my dreams
And who I'll promise to
Please hear me when I say
I can't live without you
Will you still love me
When I tear your heart away
Will you still love me
And know my love from my mistakes
I walked with a shadow
That hung before my eyes
What I could not see
It was heartbreak in disguise
Now I look through a mirror
Of what might have been
And wish for the day
I might see your smile again
Will you still love me
When I tear your heart away
Will you still love me
And know my love from my mistakes
Will you still love me
When I tear your heart away
Will you still love me
And know my love from my mistakes
Will you still love me
And know my love from my mistakes
