Song Name: Never in My Wildest Dreams
Never in my wildest dreams
Would I be loving you
Never in my wildest dreams
Would my dreams come true
You're just too good to touch
I can't discuss it much
I get too choked up
Don't wanna make a scene
Never In My Wildest Dreams
Never in my wildest dreams
Would I roam this land
Sail across the seven seas
I'm a hard luck man
But I know what my purpose is
It ain't no some pilgrimage
Its wherever my baby is
My love supreme
Never In My Wildest Dreams
Walk in the cold cold wind
Carry my laundry bin
Take my recs for a spin
Watch daytime TV
You're just too good to touch
And I can't discuss it much
I get too choked up
Don't wanna make a scene
Never In My Wildest Dreams
