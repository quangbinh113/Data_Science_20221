Song Name: Anderson County
Are the stars coming out over Anderson County
Same little town where your kiss first found me
Two young kids in the back of that truck
Running out of time, we were running on love
A last summer slow dance, high school dream
Hometown sweethearts, homecoming queen
Nothing more to give than a high school ring
The promise of forever we knew we couldn't keep
And the next thing we know your Mitsubishi's weighed down
With everything you own as you headed out of town
You said four years would fly by so fast
And girl yeah it did but you never came back
Tell me do you ever think about
The kinda life that we talked about
A piece of land with little house planted on the outskirts of town
And tell me is your sky still blue
Are you the same girl that I once knew
And do you ever think about me like I think about you
I still see your daddy round town now and then
When your name comes up I just ask how you been
He paints a picture that you're doing great
And my mind goes back to if you would have stayed and
Tell me do you ever think about
The kinda life that we talked about
A piece of land with little house planted on the outskirts of town
And tell me is your sky still blue
Are you the same girl that I once knew
And do you ever think about me like I think about you
Tell me do you ever think about
The kinda life that we talked about
A piece of land with little house planted on the outskirts of town
Could you see us in a wooden frame
Rocking chairs with our hair turned gray
Does it make you smile like I do
And do you think about me like I think about you
When the stars come out over Anderson County
Are you thinking about me like I think about you
