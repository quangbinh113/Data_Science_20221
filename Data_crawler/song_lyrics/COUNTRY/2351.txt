Song Name: Island
Sometimes it seems like yesterday
Other times more than a million years
Oh little girl sweeter than an angel
When I think of her I laugh,
And drown in my own tears
You draw your first breath so close to me
Now we've been apart for years and years
She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet Island
Maybe times will someday build a bridge for us
Somewhere father down the line; I know
But for you this;
To show you who's on my mind
She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet Island
Whatever they may say about my silence
Remember I'm an Island too
We're connected by more than an ocean
My blood runs in you
She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet Island
