Song Name: Bye Bye Love
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'til he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might've been
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
Bye-bye my love, goodbye
