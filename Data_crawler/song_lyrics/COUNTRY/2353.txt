Song Name: Rattlesnake Rock 'N' Roller
Howdy sokes, I mean folks
I'm fixin' to do ya a little banjo pickin' down here in this old, big rattlesnake den
Boy, there's some big whoppers down here
And I know what they want me to do
They want me to pick somethin' real slow along on this banjo
But I ain't gonna do it 'cause I like this fast rock-'n'-roll
Well I'd rather be a-fishin'
Or at least just a-wishin' I was
And if you really ask me
I'll tell you what is in my heart
'Cause I'm a down home picker
And a country boy singer to start
I love cruisin' down the highway
Gettin' set to play at night
Or sittin' in a honky tonk
With a mason jar 'till light
And if I get the call
You know I'm not afraid to fight
'Cause I'm a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rattlesnake Rock 'n' Roller
Living in the city put a bite in my soul
If you live in the country they say
You will never grow older
If you're a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rattlesnake Rock 'n' Roller
I'm a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rattlesnake Rock 'n' Roller
Living in the city put a bite in my soul
If you live in the country they say
You will never grow older
If you're a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rattlesnake Rock 'n' Roller
Well I'm a headin' for the country
With the stars shinin' up above
Gonna do me some fishin'
Instead of just a-wishin' I was
'Cause a Rattlesnake bites
And a-moonlit nites is a-what I love
I'm a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rattlesnake Rock 'n' Roller
Oh, living in the city put a bite in my soul
If you live in the country they say
You will never grow older
If you're a Rattlesnake Rocker
Rock 'n' Roller
