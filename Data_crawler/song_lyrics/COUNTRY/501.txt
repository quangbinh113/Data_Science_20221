Song Name: Maybe It Was Memphis
Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight
Katy did sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowin' through the willow tree
What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you?
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a William's play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away
What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you?
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Every night now since I've been back home
Lie awake drifting in the memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me
What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you?
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
You know it sure felt right
