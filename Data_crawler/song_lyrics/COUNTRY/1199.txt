Song Name: Blessings
First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
A couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings, oh yeah
Always take time to count your blessings, oh
