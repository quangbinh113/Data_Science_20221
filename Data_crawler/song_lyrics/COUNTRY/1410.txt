Song Name: Wherever You Are Tonight
Rosemary right about sunset
Glass of wine, is it white or red
Do you still like smokin' cigarettes when you drink
Cover band's playing way too loud
You'd be dancing in the middle of the crowd
Some college friends who are back in town for the week
You, oh you
Oh I still ain't over you
And I, still think of you sometimes
You, oh you
Girl if you only knew
Yeah I, I'd still give it one more try
Wherever you are tonight(wherever you are tonight)
Seattle standing in the pouring rain
First time i ever saw your face
Do you ever think about that day we met
You, oh you
Oh I, still ain't over you
And I, still think of you sometimes
You, oh you
Girl, if you only knew
Yeah I, I'd still give it one more try
Wherever you are tonight
We never really said goodbye
Maybe, somewhere down the line
You, oh you
Oh I still ain't over you
And I, still think of you sometimes
You, oh you
Girl if you only knew
Yeah I, I'd still give it one more try
Wherever you are tonight(wherever you are tonight)
