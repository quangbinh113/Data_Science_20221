Song Name: Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer
(J.Marks)
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixon
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!
