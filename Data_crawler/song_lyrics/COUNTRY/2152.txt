Song Name: Real Damn Good
Her favorite color is faded Levi blue
She folds her laundry in her birthday suit
Yeah, I was at the TV during Family Feud
Puts her turquoise on when she's in the mood
She puts her turquoise on when she's in the mood
She keeps her makeup in a coffee can
Got a Bible verse tattoo on her hand
Goes 90 in a 50 in her minivan
And she's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's a little bit out there
Whole lotta don't care, gonna do what she wants
Living her life one night at a time, more hippie than debutante
Oh, she's genuine, one of a kind, hard to find, hard to understand
She ain't that great at not being late
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
Packs a .38 special in her Gucci purse
Likes chocolate on her chocolate when she has desserts
Wears a KISS T-shirt when she goes to church
I never met a woman quite like her
Never met a woman quite like her
She's a little bit out there
Whole lotta don't care, gonna do what she wants
Living her life one night at a time, more hippie than debutante
Oh, she's genuine, one of a kind, hard to find, hard to understand
She ain't that great at not being late
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's a little bit out there
Whole lotta don't care, gonna do what she wants
Living her life one night at a time, more hippie than debutante
Oh, she's genuine, one of a kind, hard to find, hard to understand
She ain't that great at not being late
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
