Song Name: Wish You Were The One
Third of october, in your gravel driveway
We said it's over so i hit the highway
I got my space and you got your freedom
But now that you're long gone
Why do i still wish you were the one?
Why do i still miss the way it was?
Back when we were ditching our friends at the dive bar
Kissing up against my car
In the middle of the night
I still dream about when you were mine
Baby even after all this time
Somehow you're still the arms i wanna run to
Maybe i still love you
If moving on's what i really want
Why do i still wish you were the one?
Yeah i started seeing somebody new
But when i see him, i still see you
In my head, in my bed
Yeah i know that we said it's for the best
Yeah then why do i still wish you were the one?
Why do i still miss the way it was?
Back when we were ditching our friends at the dive bar
Kissing up against my car
In the middle of the night
I still dream about when you were mine
Baby even after all this time
Somehow you're still the arms i wanna run to
Maybe i still love you
If moving on's what i really want
Why do i still wish you were the one?
Waking up in my t-shirt
Ooh i was putting me first
Damn we had it good
I wonder what it could've been
Why do i still wish you were the one?
Why do i still miss the way it was?
Back when we were ditching our friends at the dive bar
Kissing up against my car
In the middle of the night
I still dream about when you were mine
Baby even after all this time
Somehow you're still the arms i wanna run to
Maybe i still love you
If moving on's what i really want
Why do i still wish you were the one?
Why do i?
Oh why do i?
Why do i still wish you were the one?
