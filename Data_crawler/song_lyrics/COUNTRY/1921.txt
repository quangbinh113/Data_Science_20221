Song Name: on my way
Always knew you, even when I didn't know you
Don't make sense, but it do
I was on my way to you (I was on my, I was on my way to you)
Every teardrop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell, but heaven sent me through
I was on my way to you (I was on my way to you)
Every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you
Hope was hopeless, faith was running
Didn't notice you were coming through
You were on your way too
And you don't believe in meant to be
But somehow you were meant for me, it's true
Yeah, you were on your way too
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you (yeah, oh)
On my way, on my way to you
On my way, on my way to you
On my way, on my way to you
(I am)
On my way (on my way)
On my way (on my way)
On my way (on my way to you)
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
On my way to you
'Cause I was on my way to you (oh)
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
On my way to you (on my, oh, ma-ma-ma)
I was on, I was on my way
I was on, I was on my way
On my way to you (on my, oh, ma-ma-ma)
On my way
On my way
