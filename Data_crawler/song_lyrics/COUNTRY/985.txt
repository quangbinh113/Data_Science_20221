Song Name: Nothing Like You
Streets full of people
Souls full of sparks

Days full of color
Turnin' nights full of stars
Everywhere I've ever been
I come back time and time again
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you
My head's full of trouble
My heart just won't sleep
Only you and every one of your kisses
Bring that healin' to me
The stories that are mine to tell
All got you and all end well

There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like the way I feel
When there's nothin' but me and you
Your love has got a hold on me
There's nothin' that I can do
There's nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you

There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you, ain't nothin' like you
Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you
There ain't nothin' like you
Ain't nothin' like you

Nothin' like you
Nothin' like you
Nothin' like you
Nothin' like you
Oh there ain't nothin' like you baby
