Song Name: The Bones - Acoustic
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, although we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went, we're still standing
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Mmm, when the bones are good
Bones are good, the rest, baby, it don't really matter
Paint could peel, the glass
Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Ooh-ooh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
