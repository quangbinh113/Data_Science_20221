Song Name: Chasin' That Neon Rainbow
Daddy won a radio,
He tuned it to a country show.
I was rockin' in the cradle
To the cryin' of a steel guitar.
Mama used to sing to me.
She taught me that sweet harmony.
Now she worries cause never thought
I'd ever really take it this far.
Singin' in the bars and
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow
Livin' that honky-tonk dream,
Cause all I've ever wanted is to
Pick this guitar and sing.
Just tryin' to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen.
A Chasin' That Neon Rainbow
Livin' that honky-tonk dream.
An atlas and a coffee cup,
5 pickers in an old Dodge truck,
Headin' down to Houston for a show
On Saturday night.
This overhead is killin' me,
Half the time I sing for free,
But when the crowd's in to it Lord
It makes this thing I'm doin' seem right.
Standin' in the spotlight.
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow
I'm a livin' that honky-tonk dream.
Cause all I've ever wanted is to
Pick this guitar and sing
Just tryin' to be somebody,
That's want to be heard and seen,
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,
Livin' that honky-tonk dream
Daddy's got a radio
He won it 30 years ago.
He said "Son I just know we're gonna
Hear you sing on it some day".
I made it up to Music Row
Lordy don't the wheels turn slow.
Still I wouldn't trade a minute,
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Just show me to the stage, I'm
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,
I'm a livin' that honky-tonk dream,
Cause all I've ever wanted,
Is to pick this guitar and sing.
Just tryin' to be somebody
That's wanna be heard and seen.
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,
Livin' that honky-tonk dream.
Oh I'm Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,
