Song Name: You Got The Wrong Guy
If you're lookin' for somebody to take you out
Slow dance close in a downtown crowd
To a song you like
You got the wrong guy
And if you're lookin' for somebody to tell his friends
He'd rather see you than to hang with them
On a Saturday night
You got the wrong guy
If he ain't puttin' you first
Hangin' on your every word
Like you deserve, I want to
If he ain't holdin' your hand
Makin' down the road plans
While he's got the chance
Why don't you?
Go on and cut him loose
He don't know what he's got
He's got you, but I know you're not
Callin' me up this late cause you wanna say hi
I think you know, you got the wrong guy (you got the wrong guy)
If you're lookin' for somebody to take you back
To his hometown, tell his mom and dad
I found the one this time
You got the wrong guy
And if you're lookin' for somebody to let you in
To fall into, and keep fallin'
You should drop on by
Cause you got the wrong guy, but I got all night
If he ain't puttin' you first
Hangin' on your every word
Like you deserve, I want to
If he ain't holdin' your hand
Makin' down the road plans
While he's got the chance
Why don't you?
Go on and cut him loose
He don't know what he's got
He's got you, but I know you're not
Callin' me up this late cause you wanna say hi
I think you know, you got the wrong guy
(You got the wrong)
(You got the wrong guy)
(You got the wrong)
And the right guy, is right here waitin'
Yeah, I'm just sayin'
If he ain't puttin' you first
Hangin' on your every word
Like you deserve, I want to
If he ain't holdin' your hand
Makin' down the road plans
While he's got the chance
Girl why don't you?
Go on and cut him loose
He don't know what he's got
He's got you, but I know you're not
Callin' me up this late cause you wanna say hi
I think you know, you got the wrong guy
(You got the wrong)
(You got the wrong guy)
(You got the wrong)
(You got the wrong guy)
