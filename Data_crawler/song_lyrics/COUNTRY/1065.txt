Song Name: You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly
You're the reason I'm ridin' 'round on recapped tyres
An' you're the reason I'm hangin' our clothes outside on walls
An' you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Ah, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But, I love you just the same
You're the reason I changed to beer from soda pop
An' you're the reason I never get to go to the beauty shop
You're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Oh, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But, I love you just the same
I guess that we won't ever have, everything we need
'Cause when we get ahead, it's got another mouth to feed
And that's the reason my good looks and my figure's gone
And that's the reason I ain't got no hair to comb
An' you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Ah but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But, I love you just the same
Conway, why in the devil don't you gon'
And shave an' put on a clean pair of pants?
Loretta, look at yourself
I wish you'd take them curlers out of your hair, 'an-
An' go put on a little bit of makeup, 'an-
An' get out of the housecoat before supper
Ha, well let me tell you somethin', Conway
Considerin' everything I went through today
I look like a movie star
Hell, yeah, Ruth Cassidy
Thank you
Besides that
All of our kids took after your part of our family anyway
Oh, they did, huh? What about the one's that's bald?
Well, I guess you might say they took after me
