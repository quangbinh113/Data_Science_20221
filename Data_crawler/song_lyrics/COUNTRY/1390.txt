Song Name: Another Mile
Everybody's probably heard by now that you're west coast gone
Yeah, they probably heard the screen door slam in a town this small
But I don't need to drink about ya under lonely neon lights
Gonna roll right by that open sign and just keep on drivin'
I'm gonna need another mile, 'nother song on the radio
Driving too fast, let the wind help me let ya go
Find a back road remedy with no speed limit
And forget ya for a little while
I'm gonna need another mile
Gonna need another round around this down town square
Before I see our friends, and they ask why you ain't here
No, I ain't running from your memory, I just need some time I swear
But before I get there
I'm gonna need another mile, 'nother song on the radio
Driving too fast, let the wind help me let ya go
Find a back road remedy with no speed limit
And forget ya for a little while
I'm gonna need another mile, yeah
A little dirt road distance
A little black top meeting the sky
Highway high
Yea, I'm gonna need another mile
I'm gonna need another mile
Everybody's probably heard by now that you're west coast gone
Yea, they probably heard the screen door slam in a town this small
I'm gonna need another mile, 'nother song on the radio
Driving too fast, let the wind help me let ya go
Find a back road remedy with no speed limit
And forget ya for a little while
I'm gonna need another mile, 'nother song on the radio
Driving too fast with the wind 'cause you let me go
Find a back road remedy with no speed limit
Then forget ya for a little while
I'm gonna need another mile
I'm gonna need another mile
I need a back road remedy with no speed limit
To forget ya for a little while
