Song Name: Hold My Horses
There's a golden palomino
She lives in my mind
And she's tame for the most part
But I tell ya sometimes
When the clock and the cash
Get the best of me
Her ties come loose
And she breaks free
I can't hold my horses
'Cause I ain't that stable
And I know I oughta break 'em
But I haven't been able
To keep from kickin' up the dust
Runnin' over the canyon
I give into the forces
'Cause I can't hold my horses
Yeah, I do my best to rein her in
Yeah, she's off to the races
I try to close my eyes
But it's 2 am and I'm shakin'
She's kinda pretty as she goes
As she takes my breath away
And not in a good way
I can't hold my horses
'Cause I ain't that stable
Yeah, I know I oughta break 'em
But I haven't been able
To keep from kickin' up the dust
Runnin' over the canyon
I give into the forces
'Cause I can't hold my horses
Halfway 'cross the desert
I'm gonna let her ride
In a few days she'll come back
And I'll be fine
I can't hold my horses
'Cause I ain't that stable
Keep tryin' to break me
But they haven't been able
I keep kickin' up the dust
Runnin' over the canyon
I give into the forces
'Cause I can't hold my horses
I can't hold my horses
Hey, hey, hey ah
Hey
