Song Name: Useless
Won't you give me just a little something to do
And I'll be satisfied
Won't you give me just a little something to prove
Not for to please my pride
Work with my hands just like a man
Not here to turn you on
I can't stand still, got to get my fill
Keep truckin' along
Oh I'm workin to make a living and that feels good you see
Oh I'm worthy and I'm willin', I'll bark and bite for free
Oh I'll try, try, try, you can bleed me dry
Oh I'm useless if you ain't got no use for me
Wouldn't it be nice if I has something to do
To keep me occupied
Wouldn't even have to be a whole to-do
Just something to bide my time
Work with my hands just like a man
Not here to turn you on
I can't stand still, got to get my fill
Keep truckin' along
Oh I'm workin to make a living and that feels good you see
Oh I'm worthy and I'm willin', I'll bark and bite for free
Oh I'll try, try, try, you can bleed me dry
Oh I'm useless if you ain't got no use for me
Oh I'm workin to make a living and that feels good you see
Oh I'm worthy and I'm willin', I'll bark and bite for free
Oh I'll try, try, try, you can bleed me dry
Oh I'm useless if you ain't got no use for me
