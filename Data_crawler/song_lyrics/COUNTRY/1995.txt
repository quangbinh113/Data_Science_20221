Song Name: Sundress
First met her on the west side of Cali
Only took one look, and girl, you had me
Drivin' down the Holywood hills through the valley
Coastline and even cruisin' Malibu
There's nothing like that shotgun view
Arm out the window, surfin' old school
Sunflowers black and yellow all over you
One hand on the wheel, the other holdin' you
Took a shot I knew I couldn't miss
When you're leanin' for that first slow kiss
This the moment that I reminisce
No matter where we are, I can't help but remember
That sunrise in that sundress
She's my pretty little thing out from sunset
Can't forget that first date, been the same since
I know you are the one for me
Watching that sunrise in that sundress
She's my pretty little thing out from sunset
Can't forget that first date, been the same since
I know you are the one for me
We've done a lot, girl, it's been a minute
It's been a while since I've seen you in it
First class from London to Paris
South beach, back home, under that Texas moon
Bring the heat, keep the summertime cool
Let's roll it backwards tight like sides glue
Sunflowers black and yellow all over you
No hands on the wheel, I can't help but remember
That sunrise in that sundress
She's my pretty little thing out from sunset
Can't forget that first date, been the same since
I know you are the one for me
Watching that sunrise in that sundress
She's my pretty little thing out from sunset
Can't forget that first date, been the same since
I know you are the one for me
