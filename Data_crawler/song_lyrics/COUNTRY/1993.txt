Song Name: Dear Alcohol (feat. Elle King)
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
Repeat the cycle everyday, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes, alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep drinking
'Cause these demons roam and follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it's turned my heart cold
But I keep drinking 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm having problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Looking at this bottle, having nothing but doubt
Don't wanna drink but it keeps coming around and around and around
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
Another morning with my memories wavy
Don't hate me, I got too faded again
I try to fight it but the loneliness breaks me
Can you blame me? The bottle's been my friend
It's gotta be sadistic, or maybe masochistic
Every night I just stay twisted
'Cause the only ones that listen
Is that sativa and the Patr√≥n and Casamigos
I didn't mean to, but I need to
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted
