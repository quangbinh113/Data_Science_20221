Song Name: Nothing's Better
You think you took the sun with you when you walked out
You think you stole the silver lining right out of my clouds
You thought that poppin' my tires
Would stop me getting around
Nah, you should see me now
No more of you calling and checking up on me
And it feels so good, feels so good (I'm telling you)
Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love
And yeah, we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
You thought you took all the good out of that goodbye
I thought I'd bring you your things, but I just left 'em outside
You thought I'd see you looking Friday night fine
And want one more try
Nah, oh, I'm done being that guy
'Cause the feeling of freedom was watching you leaving
And it feels so good, feels so good (I'm telling you)
Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love
And yeah, we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love
And yeah, we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
