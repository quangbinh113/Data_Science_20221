Song Name: Heaven's Like a Hometown
I hope they got a Texaco
With the coldest ice-cold beer
I hope they got Friday nights
The home team's undefeated every year
I hope they got a honey hole
Where the fish always bite
It says "Stay a while"
On that welcome sign
It's all porch swing swinging kinda weather
It's all God's country stretching out forever
I hope heaven's like a hometown
You can roll 'round
And all the streets of gold
Got a little bit of dirt on 'em
I hope it's just a quick ten to my momma's house
Every country mile's got a little white church on 'em
I ain't ready to go
But when He calls me home
To that map dot up in the clouds
I hope heaven's like a hometown
I hope heaven's like a hometown
Hometown, yeah
If they got a stoplight
I hope it flashes yellow after ten o'clock
If you want to go fifty in a thirty-five
You ain't ever got to worry about the cops
And everybody knows everybody
Nobody's a stranger
Every backyard's forty acres
I hope heaven's like a hometown
You can roll 'round
And all the streets of gold
Got a little bit of dirt on 'em
I hope it's just a quick ten to my momma's house
Every country mile's got a little white church on 'em
I ain't ready to go
But when He calls me home
To that map dot up in the clouds
I hope heaven's like a hometown
I hope heaven's like a hometown
Hometown, yeah
The kind that makes you wanna put some roots down
The kind you never wanna get out
I hope heaven's like a hometown
You can roll 'round
And all the streets of gold
Got a little bit of dirt on 'em
I hope it's just a quick ten to my momma's house
And every country mile's got a little white church on 'em
I ain't ready to go
But when He calls me home
To that map dot up in the clouds
I hope heaven's like a hometown
I hope heaven's like a hometown
Hometown, yeah
