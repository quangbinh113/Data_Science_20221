Song Name: I Think About You
Everytime, I see a woman on a billboard sign
...I think about you
Saying, "Drink this beer... & you'll be mine"
...I think about you
When an actress, on the movie screen
Plays lolita, in some old man's dream
It doesn't matter, who she is
...I think about you

(...)

When, I see a pretty woman, walkin' down the street
...I think about you
Men look her up & down, like she's some kind of treat
Oh... I think about you
She wouldn't dare, talk to a stranger
Always has to be aware, of the danger
Doesn't matter, who she is
I think about you...
Eight years old
Big, blue eyes
And a heart of gold
When, I look at this world
I think about you...
And I can't help but see
That every woman, used to be
Somebody's little girl
...I think about you
(...)
Everytime, I hear people say, it's never gonna change
...I think about you
Like, it's some kind of joke
Some kind of game
Girl... I think about you
When, I see a woman on the news
Who didn't ask, to be abandoned or abused
It doesn't matter, who she is
I think about you...
Eight years old
Big, blue eyes
And a heart of gold
When, I look at this world
I think about you...
And I can't help but see
That every woman, used to be
Somebody's little girl
I think about you...
Eight years old
Big, blue eyes
And a heart of gold
When, I look at this world
...I think about you
I think about you
Ohhh... I think about you
Baby, I think about you...
