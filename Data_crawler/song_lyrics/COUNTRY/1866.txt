Song Name: Found It In You
You're the phone call picking up in the middle of the night
You're the patience I don't have when things ain't right
You're the "you can do it" even when I don't wanna try
Oh, my mama always said that real good love is just hard to find
But I found it in you
Every little thing that I was missin', babe
You love me a whole different kind of crazy
You got to the heart of me, the best part of me
I found it in you
The confidence to know that I can be happy
Just 'cause you tell me that you got me
All that I was looking for, ain't gotta look no more
I found it in you
You, you
You can catch me all dressed up or letting all my hair down
Ain't nobody love me like you love me, baby, right now
You know how to make a girl smile, yeah, boy you do
This girl is wild, wild about you
And baby I'm glowing, may not always show it
But all I know is
I found it in you
Every little thing that I was missin', babe
You love me a whole different kind of crazy
You got to the heart of me, the best part of me
I found it in you
The confidence to know that I can be happy
Just 'cause you tell me that you got me
All that I was looking for, ain't gotta look no more
I found it in you, you
Oh, I found it in you
Found it in you
Every little thing I was missin', babe
You love me a whole different kind of crazy
Oh, the best part of me
I found it in you
The confidence to know that I can be happy
Just 'cause you tell me that you got me
All that I was looking for, I found it in you
And I think I, oh
That I found it in you
