Song Name: Here for the Party
Well I'm an eight ball shooting, double fisted drinking son of a gun
I wear my jeans a little tight just to watch the little boys come undone
I'm here for the beer and the ball busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can
You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leavin' 'til they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun, gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party
I may not be a ten but the boys say I clean up good
And if I gave 'em half a chance for some rowdy romance
You know they would
I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys and their pick up lines
You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leavin' 'til they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun, gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party
Don't want no purple hooter shooter, just some jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk
You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leavin' 'til they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun, gonna get me some
I'm here
Ah-ah
You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leavin' 'til they throw me out (just try to throw me out)
Gonna have a little fun, gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party
I'm here for the party, yeah
I'm here for the party (I'm here for the party)
Just try to throw me out
I'm here for the party (just try to throw me out)
I'm here for the party, yeah
