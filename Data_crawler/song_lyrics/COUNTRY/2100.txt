Song Name: Let Me Be There
Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I'll always want to be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong
And make it right (make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland that
Only two can share
All I ask you
Is let me be there (oh, let me be there)
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I'll always want to be there
Whenever you feel
You need a friend to lean on; here I am
Whenever you call
You know I'll be there
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong
And make it right (make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland that
Only two can share
All I ask you
Is let me be there (oh, let me be there)
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong
And make it right (make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland that
Only two can share
All I ask you
Is let me be there (let me be there)
All I ask you
Is let me be there (let me be there)
