Song Name: Rockin' This Christmas
Hang on your holly berries
Put up the tree
Love to see you shake it
In red and green
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas...
Well into New Years Eve
Turn out the lights
Call the law
Me and you baby
Gonna go deck the halls
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas...
Well into New Years Eve
Rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas...
Well into New Years Eve
Before too long we will be feelin' no pain
We'll be flyin' like a jet powered air-e-o-plane
We gonna let it all go
Shove it over the line
You show me yours
And I'll show you mine
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas...
Well into New Years Eve
Rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas
We'll be rockin' this Christmas...
Well into New Years Eve
