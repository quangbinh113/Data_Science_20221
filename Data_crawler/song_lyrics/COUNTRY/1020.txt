Song Name: Take Me Home, Country Roads
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads, everybody sing
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home down country roads
Take me home down country roads
