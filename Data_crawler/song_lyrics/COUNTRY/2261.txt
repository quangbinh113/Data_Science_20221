Song Name: Single White Female
I know that every morning you go thumbin'
Through the personal want ads
You grab the latest copy, a cup of coffee
And settle in for a good laugh
I've been trying to catch your eye but I'm so shy
I'm hopin' and prayin' that
Today's edition is gonna catch your attention
'Cause there's a
Single white female
Looking for that special lover
To put it in a nutshell
A one womsn man who doesn't want no other
Oh, you never can tell
She just might be your dream come true
A single white female
Is looking for a man like you
Yeah I'm a little nervous I'm not sure if
I shoulda put it in writing
It might have been a little reckless, a little desperate
But I think I did the right thing
I couldn't go on living keep it hidden
So I'm telling you everything
It's my confession I hope you get the message
There's a
Single white female
Looking for that special lover
To put it in a nutshell
A one woman man who doesn't want no other
Oh, you never can tell
She just might be your dream come true
A single white female
Is looking for a man like you
It's my confession I hope you get the message
That there's a
Single white female
Looking for that special lover
To put it in a nutshell
A one woman man who doesn't want no other
Oh, you never can tell
She just might be your dream come true
A single white female
Is looking for a man like you
Looking for a man like you
Looking for a man like you
