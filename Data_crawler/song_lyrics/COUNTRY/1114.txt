Song Name: Ceremony
I let it slide
Thought tomorrow would be fine
I'd get it right
But as the dusk fell into night
It lay forgotten
At the bottom of sea
Of things I wanted
So now I won't let go of you and me
Let's not stand on ceremony
Wanna be your one and only
Wanna be your one and only one
Stuck in the lines
Just filling in the gaps
They said were mine
No thoughts, no questions asked
How you changed me?
Brought colours into view
Like a daydream
My skyline shifting hue
Let's not stand on ceremony
Wanna be your one and only
Wanna be your one and only one
So what do you say love?
Say you see us
So what do you say love?
Say you see us
I've seen enough to know
Seen people that I love
Turn all their hope to dust
When somethings don't add up
And if I'm honest
I thought life was making plans
Just counting losses
Till you showed me what I had
Let's not stand on ceremony
Wanna be your one and only
Wanna be your one and only one
Let's not stand on ceremony
Wanna be your one and only
Wanna be your one and only one
