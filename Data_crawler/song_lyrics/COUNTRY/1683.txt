Song Name: Longneck Way To Go
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Well these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this gettin' over you is goin' down slow
And it's closin' in on closin' time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Keep 'em cold
Keep 'em comin'
Bartender don't tell me
I'm runnin' out of time
If these tears keep fallin'
Well last call just might last all night
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Well these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this gettin' over you sure goin' down slow
And it's closin' in on closin' time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Well I thought a couple rounds
Might do the trick
But you're still on my mind
And I lost count after five or six
Now it's two AM and I'm still buyin'
Got a tab
Keep it open
'Cause I'm still drinkin'
And I'm still hopin' drown your memory
Aw but it's got a pretty tight grip on me
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Well these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this gettin' over you sure goin' down slow
And it's closin' in on closin' time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long
Longneck way to go
Yeah sure got a long
Longneck way to go
