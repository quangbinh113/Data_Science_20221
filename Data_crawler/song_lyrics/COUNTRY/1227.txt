Song Name: Meanwhile Back At Mama's
Runnin' round in this new truck
Bank let's me borrow from month to month
Runnin' out of credit and find a little cash on the radio
Standin' still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin' Nascar fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know
Cause where I come from only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge,
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss,
In a world gone crazy as this
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here,
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss, in a world gone crazy as this
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road I miss corn growin' in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town roots, walkin' around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's the for sale sign's goin' up and I'm gonna dump this truck and the little I got on a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich, watch the sun settin' on the ridge, baby tell me what you think about this
Me and you back at Mama's

Yeah me and you back at Mama's
