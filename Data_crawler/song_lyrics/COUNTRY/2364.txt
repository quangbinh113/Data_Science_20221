Song Name: Goin' Down South
Goin' down South, I'm going down South
Goin' down South, I'm going down South
Where the chilly wind don't blow
I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you babe
I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you baby
I don't care where you go
Some other man, some other man
Some other man, some other man
Always hangin' around
I'd rather be dead, I'd be rather dead
I'd rather be dead, I'd be rather dead
Than to see you with another man
(Sleepin' six feet in the ground)
(Repeat)
