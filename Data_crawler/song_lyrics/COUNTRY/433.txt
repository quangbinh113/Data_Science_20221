Song Name: Mr. Mom
Oh yeah!
Lost my job, came home mad,
Got a hug and a kiss and "That's too bad."
She said,
"I can go to work untill
You find another job"
Ha, I thought,
I like the sound of that,
Watch tv and take long naps
Go from a hard-working dad
To being Mr. Mom,
Well,
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher,
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time,
Breakfast six, naps at nine,
There bubblegum in the baby's hair,
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair,
Been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday-
Mr. Mom!
Football, soccer, and ballet,
Squeeze in scouts and PTA,
And theres that shopping list she left
Thats seven pages long,
How much smoke can a stove make?
Kids wont eat my charcoal cake,
It's more than any man can take,
Being Mr. Mom,
Well,
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher,
Rewind Barney for the fiftheenth time,
Breakfast six, naps at nine,
There bubblegum in the baby's hair,
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair,
Been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday-
Mr. Mom!
Before I fall in bed tonight,
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time
Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher,
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time,
Breakfast six, naps at nine,
There bubblegum in the baby's hair,
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair,
Been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday-
Mr. Mom!
Oh Mr. Mom,
Balancing check books, juggling bills,
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel when
What I don't know is how you do it,
Oh
Honey, you're my hero
