Song Name: Midnight Girl / Sunset Town
(Don Schlitz)
I was born in a small town
Mama was a farmer's wife
We knew everyone for miles around
We lived here all our lives.
It never even entered their minds
I might not want to stay
But I'm young and still got time
I got to get away.
And there's one stop-light
Blinkin' on and off
Everyone knows where
Their neighbors are.
They roll up the streets
When the sun goes down
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
Seen places on the TV
Where they stay up all night long
Around here it's early to bed
And they rise before the dawn,
They say the old ways are still the best
I cannot deny it
But I can't get no rest
'Cause it's just too quiet.
And there's one stop-light
Blinkin' on and off
Everyone knows where
Their neighbors are.
They roll up the streets
When the sun goes down
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
--- Instrumental ---
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before the world turns 'round
Lord, don't leave me in this one horse town.
(Lord, don't leave me in this one horse town.)
Lord, don't leave me in this one horse town.
(Lord, don't leave me in this one horse town.)
Well, there's one stop-light
Blinkin' on and off
Everyone knows where
Their neighbors are.
They roll up the streets
When the sun goes down
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
There's one stop-light
Blinkin' on and off
Everyone knows where
Their neighbors are.
They roll up the streets
When the sun goes down
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town.
I'm a midnight girl
In a sunset town...
