Song Name: Better Than That
Two months I told her that I loved her before she said it back
I didn't mind I just wanted her to know where I was at
'Cause she made me feel like I was loved even before there were words
And if we were gonna last forever who cares who said it first
She took me to her hometown, Upper West Manhattan
Opened up her heart and told me I could have it
Being with her felt like anything could happen
Anything could happen
What if it never gets better than that?
What if the best I'll ever have
Is already part of my past
And I'm wasting my time trying to find
Somebody to love like I had
When there was no time to look back
What if it never gets better, better, better than that?
She used to jump up on my back when she'd had too much to drink
Pull me down to the ground and kiss my cheek until it turned pink
Lie in the grass and tell me I was all that she'd ever need
And at the time I know it was something that she believed
What if it never gets better than that?
What if the best I'll ever have
Is already part of my past
And I'm wasting my time trying to find
Somebody to love like I had
When there was no time to look back
What if it never gets better, better, better than that?
And the love of my life was over by 22
Nothing new ever lives up to the way that it felt
To be held in her arms, in her heart, is that all
That I get?
What if it never gets better than that?
What if the best I'll ever have
Is already part of my past
And I'm wasting my time trying to find
Somebody to love like I had
When there was no time to look back
What if it never gets better, better, better than that?
