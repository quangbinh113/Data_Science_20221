Song Name: Greatest Love Story
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night
Riding shotgun in my car
We go to the river and find us a spot
And probably went a little too far
Just a little too far
Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted
You were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story
This town had ever seen
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was working that nine to five
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms
I have never felt so alive
I spent my days working, spent my nights drinking
Howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon
When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story
This town had ever seen
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks
To find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down
You had the same old feelings for me
So I went to the store and I bought you a ring
And I got down on one knee
Got down on one knee
And I said
I am gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and your what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story
This town has ever seen
We are gonna be the greatest love story
This world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me
