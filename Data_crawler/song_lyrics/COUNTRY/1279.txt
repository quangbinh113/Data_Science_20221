Song Name: Breakups - Acoustic
You're the only one in the world I wanna talk to right now
The only one to pick me up on a night like this, and I know
You'll be the first thing on my mind in the mornin', mmm
Sober or drunk, you're the one that I just miss, mmm
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I can take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 a.m.
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all, but right now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
I bought a drink for a girl and I got her number
I even thought about walkin' her out that door, mmm
The only thing that came close to you was her perfume, mmm
And got me wonderin' what we gave it all up for, oh
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I could take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 a.m.
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all, but right now, mmm
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
No, no
Oh, no
I should be movin' on
You should be movin' on, babe, yeah-ayy
'Cause I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I can take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 a.m.
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all, but right now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past (oh)
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
