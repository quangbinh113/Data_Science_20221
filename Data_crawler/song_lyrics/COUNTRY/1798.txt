Song Name: I'm Alright
Well, it's been a long time, glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again, another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
You'd better grab a chair and a couple of beers
Looking good in your three piece suit
You know, I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one to follow the light
And you look like you're doing alright, yeah
Been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where money gets tight
But I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Well, we had a lot of dreams when we were younger
They thought we were crazy, but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends, skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our...
We lost touch, we lost in love
We lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Well, I guess I'm doing alright
Alright!
Well, I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Just send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call, that would even be better
Give the kids a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
And tell them all my future's looking bright
Well, I miss 'em but I'm doing alright
I said I miss 'em but I'm doing alright
Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Well, I guess I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright
