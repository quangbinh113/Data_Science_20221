Song Name: Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)
I got some money in my pocket, got some trouble on my tail
I can hear the dive's a-knocking, guess I'm heading off the rails
Singing, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm talking 'bout you-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I got some new best friends forever, see, I met 'em at the bar
Where the whiskey goes down better, when they don't know who you are
Singing, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm talking 'bout you-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh-ooh, 'cause I'm going hard tonight
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me?
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
Not staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
We don't gotta wait until the weekend
There's always time for jumping off the deep end
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry, I'll be fine
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home, yeah
We're in the bathroom gettin' chatty, there's a line out in the hall
Tryna be my sugar daddy, gettin' handsy in the stalls
Singing, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm talking 'bout you-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You like my gin and tonic kisses, 'cause you know they taste so sweet
And I know you got your missus, but there ain't no one like me
Talkin' 'bout you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mmm, I'm talking 'bout you-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh-ooh, 'cause I'm going hard tonight
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me?
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
Not staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
We don't gotta wait until the weekend
There's always time for jumping off the deep end
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry, I'll be fine
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home, yeah
(Oh-oh) I don't wanna
(Oh-oh-oh) don't wanna go home
(Oh-oh) I don't wanna
(Oh-oh-oh)
So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me?
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
Not staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home
We don't gotta wait until the weekend (hell no)
There's always time for jumping off the deep end (let's go)
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry, I'll be fine
Baby, I'm drunk, and I don't wanna go home, yeah
(Oh-oh) I don't wanna
(Oh-oh-oh) don't wanna go home
(Oh-oh) I don't wanna
(Oh-oh-oh) don't wanna go home
