Song Name: To Us It Did
It didn't really take a hundred years to get to twenty-one
It didn't take a whole case of beer to have a little fun
And a fire don't need gasoline and a Black Cat to get lit, nah
But to us it did
That first kiss didn't really get you higher than the moon
And takin' hits off cigarettes didn't really make you cool
That first check from that first job don't really make you rich, naw
But to us it did
Our trucks didn't really go 200 miles an hour
That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big
Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers
Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly
But to us it did, yeah
A brand new guitar don't make you a star
And a broken heart don't really break
Don't mean you ain't a man if you didn't cliff jump into that lake
That corner spot in McDonald's lot don't mean a lot to most kids
Ah, but to us it did
Our trucks didn't really go 200 miles an hour
That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big
Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers
Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly
But to us it did
Oh, to us it did, oh
Yeah, runnin' from them blue lights didn't make you Dukes of Hazzard
How hard you punch, how far you hit, it didn't really matter
Oh, wasted time shouldn't qualify for the nights you won't forget, no
But to us it did
Our trucks didn't really go 200 miles an hour
That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big (yeah)
Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers
Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly
But to us it did
(Our trucks didn't really go 200 miles an hour)
(That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big) Oh, it wasn't big
(Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers)
(Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly)
But to us it did
