Song Name: Anything Goes
Alabama on the Boombox, baby
I'm 'bout to get a little Boondock crazy
Let's go!
Y'all better turn this around
Feels good, don't it?
Big stars breakin' out through the indigo
Chilly wind comin' in in stereo
Taillights disappearin' 'bout a mile or so
Down a county road
Phone blowin' up "Where you is?"
Baby saying "Baby, let's do this!"
Rocket in a bottle with a fuse lit
'Bout to lift it off, I'm about to twist it off
I'm on the river that Dixie silver smokin' up a faded out four by four
Girls headin' off to the river
Yeah, Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party?
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
And anything goes on a Friday night
(Get your party right)
(It's a Friday night)
(Get your party right)
(It's a Friday night)
Baby, you ain't nothin' but a masterpiece
Swayin' and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big, loud beat
Nothing but heat, come on
Somebody's rockin' that Bangbox
Everybody hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tick tock
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends
I'm on the river, that Dixie silver smokin' up a faded out four by four
Girls headin' off to the river
Yeah, Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party?
Only one way do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
And anything goes on a Friday night
(Get your party right, it's a Friday night)
(Get your party right, it's a Friday night)
Alabama on the boombox, baby
About to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Alabama on the Boombox, baby
I'm 'bout get a little Boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Come on y'all, let's go
I'm on the river, that Dixie silver smokin' up a faded out four by four
Girls headin' off to the river
Yeah, Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party?
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
Anything goes on a Friday night
(Get your party right, it's a Friday night) yeah
(Get your party right, it's a Friday night) it's a party
(Get your party right, it's a Friday night) c'mon baby
Anything goes on a Friday night
(Alabama on the Boombox baby)
(I'm 'bout to get a little Boondock crazy)
