Song Name: The Difference
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
I'm tired of sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting ten minutes just to text you back
So you don't get to thinkin' that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shottie
I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe
All I'm tryna say is
There's a difference between "Miss you" and "I miss your face"
There's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby how was your day?"
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"
And I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do
I wanna be the difference between "Hey what's up?" and "What we gonna do tonight?"
Between yeah she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah pumping the brakes or hitting the gas
There's a difference between "Miss you" and "I miss your face"
There's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby how was your day?"
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"
And I wanna be the difference
Close the distance
And be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing babe
Oh I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do
There's a difference between "Miss you" and "I miss your face"
There's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby how was your day?"
Yeah there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"
And I wanna be the difference I am
Well I wanna be the difference
I wanna be the difference
