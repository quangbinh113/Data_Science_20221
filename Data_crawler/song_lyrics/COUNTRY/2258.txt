Song Name: Let's Go to Vegas
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Lyin' on the banks of the river
Stars are dancin', Lord it's hot
Holdin' you is what I live for
I just had a crazy though
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Find a little wedding chapel
A pair of rings, and a preacher, too
Underneath the neon steeple
We'll take a gamble and say "I do"
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Viva Las Vegas
Sparklin' lights
Dangerous living, tumbling dice
You're my ace in the hole now, honey
And I'm your Lady Luck
Pack a few things and a little money
And put it in the truck
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Viva Las Vegas
Sparklin' lights
Dangerous living, tumbling dice
You're my ace in the hole now, honey
And I'm your Lady Luck
Pack a few things and a little money
And put it in the truck
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life goodbye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Bet on love and let it ride
Bet on love and let it ride
Hoo!
