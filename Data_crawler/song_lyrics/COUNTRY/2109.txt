Song Name: Heaven's Just A Sin Away
Heaven's just a sin away,
Woah, oh, just a sin away.
I can't wait another day;
I think I'm givin' in.
How I long to hold you tight,
Woah, oh, be with you tonight.
But that still don't make it right,
'Cos I belong to him.
Oh, way down deep inside,
I know that it's all wrong.
Your lies keep tempting me,
But I never was that strong.
Devil's got me down,
Woah, oh, gone and got me now.
I can't fight him anyhow;
I think he's gonna win.
Heaven's just a sin away,
Woah, oh, just a sin away.
Heaven help me when I say:
I think I'm givin' in.
Instrumental break.
Oh, way down deep inside,
I know that it's all wrong.
Your lies keep tempting me,
But I never was that strong.
Devil's got me down,
Woah, oh, gone and got me now.
I can't fight him anyhow;
I think he's gonna win.
Heaven's just a sin away,
Woah, oh, just a sin away.
Heaven help me when I say:
I think I'm givin' in.
I think I'm givin' in.
I think I'm givin' in
