Song Name: Better Strangers
We could walk down the street and
Our eyes wouldn't meet and
I could go to all the places we used to go to
My heart would still beat, but
Wouldn't feel so incomplete and
I could meet the girl I'd be if I didn't know you
But, boy, I know you
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was morе than just a losin' game
I wish we werе better strangers
Couldn't tell you how it feels
I got a pain that never heals
The kind that brings you to your knees
Hits you so hard that you can't breathe
Like you did to me
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was more than just a losin' game
I wish we were better strangers
Better strangers
Wish I could take back all my secrets
Take back all my tears
Wish you were somethin' I didn't believe in
Like you were never here
I wish we were better strangers
Better strangers
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was more than just a losin' game
I wish we were better strangers
