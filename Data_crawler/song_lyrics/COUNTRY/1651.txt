Song Name: In Dreams
I hope I'm in your dreams
The way you are in all of my mine
You've got a love so fine
I wish that I could make you mine
Won't you sit down, you know I love you honey
And you look so tired
I know it's hard how we're thrown into this life
Then one day we must die
But that river will flow on
Even after we're all long gone
That river will flow on
Take me with you now before I'm one
I walk into the room and there you sit
There you sit, you so alone and quiet
I can't help but stare how I love you, and it just ain't fair
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
But that river will flow on
Even after we're all long gone
That river will flow on
Take me with you now before I'm one
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
