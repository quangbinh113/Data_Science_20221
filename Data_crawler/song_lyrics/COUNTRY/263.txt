Song Name: Sunshine & Whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees"
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, copper tone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this"
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, copper tone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
