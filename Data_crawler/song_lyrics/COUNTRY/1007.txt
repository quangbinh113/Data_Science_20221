Song Name: This Town Still Talks About You
Seems like there's not a day that goes by I don't hear your name around here

Stories of who you were echo like a soft whisper in my ear
Street corner conversations
Reminiscin' with the waitress
Oh it never gets old
Since you moved on from here
Time's moved on in years
And I wonder if you know
Oh this town still talks about you
Like you never left
Hidden sounds in cracked sidewalks and church pews
How could we forget?
You were so loved, you were one of our own
And it's never been the same since you've been gone
Oh this town still talks about you
Heard that you used to work summers as a checkout clerk at the IGA
Walk down the high school halls
Your picture's on the wall in a trophy case

And all those jokes you tell
They're alive and well
Down at the barbershop
I guess you hung around
Somethin' to talk about
And I hope it never stops
Oh this town still talks about you
Like you never left
Hidden sounds in cracked sidewalks and church pews
How could we forget?
You were so loved, you were one of our own
And it's never been the same since you've been gone
Oh this town still talks about you
And all those jokes you tell
They're alive and well
Down at the barbershop
Oh this town still talks about you
Like you never left
Hidden sounds in cracked sidewalks and the church pews
How could we forget?
You were so loved, you were one of our own
And it's never been the same since you've been gone
Oh this town still talks about you
