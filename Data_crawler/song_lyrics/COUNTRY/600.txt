Song Name: The Shake
Oh, yeah, here we go
Some men are attracted
To a pair of big blue eyes
It takes a pretty face
To make their temperature rise
Looks aren't that important
Just icing on the cake
What really turns me on
Is the shake
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Come on, baby, you know what I like
Shake it real funky
Shake it real low
Shake it 'til you can't shake it no more
It's a natural attraction
Mother nature wouldn't make a mistake
What really turns me on
Is the shake
Eve first said to Adam
Which outfit do you like?
The maple or the fig leave?
Now honey they both look nice
Clothes don't mean that much to me
Baby, you better go and ask the snake
What really turns me on
Is the shake
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Come on, baby, you know what I like
Shake it real funky
Shake it real low
Shake it 'til you can't shake it no more
It's a natural attraction
Mother nature wouldn't make a mistake
What really turns me on
Is the shake
Shake it (shake it)
Gary, Indiana
Moblie, Alabama
Phoenix, Arizona
Bismark, North Dakota
New York, LA
Houston, Tampa Bay
London, Tokyo
Everywhere you go
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Come on, baby, you know what I like
Shake it real funky
Shake it real low
Shake it 'til you can't shake it no more
It's a natural attraction
Mother nature wouldn't make a mistake
What really turns me on
Is the shake
I said what really turns me on
Is the shake
The shake
Is the shake
The shake, shake, shake, shake
Oh, shake it!
The shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
C'mon
Shake it one more time
