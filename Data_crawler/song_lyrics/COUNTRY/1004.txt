Song Name: Bulleit Blues
Pour out some Bulleit and pull it straight to the brain
I didn't know this morning that it would be one of those days
I said I wouldn't go forgetting my name
I know I shouldn't
But I can't help but try and wash it all away
Mm, try to paint the picture
But I can't see myself in the frame
I'm somewhere stage left
On a plane, sippin' champagne
I said I wouldn't run away for the fame
I know I shouldn't but I can't help
But think that it's all goin' up in flames
Now it's all been proven
And I can't help but sit here and drown in my own shame
