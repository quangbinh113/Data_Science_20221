Song Name: Y'all Life (feat. Ciara)
Small town, y'all town, double dutch in the park
Ice-cream truck failing that emissions test hard
Got that blow up Grinch in the yard, and it's March
Ain't coming down anytime soon
Y'all, them nursing homes still rattling with some Dolly Parton
And them high school kids traveling like James Harden
In them white limousines to the Olive Garden
On prom night, it's good times, right?
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how
Y'all, we raise up and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Your street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow
Said, where the crawdads crawl
Said, living that y'all life, y'all (y'all life, y'all)
Y'all all them dads tell them boys, "Son, walk it off"
Y'all all them mamas tell them girls, "Better keep your legs crossed"
All them hands in the stands praying for the coin toss
Lord, please, "We want the ball at the half"
Say y'all, it's all about a dub and a dirt road
And amen in a church on the third row
With your arm around your girl like a fur coat
On a Sunday, come Monday
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how
Y'all, we raise up and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Your street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow
Said, where the crawdads crawl
Said, living that y'all life, y'all (y'all life, y'all)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Y'all life, y'all life
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Y'all life, y'all life
Said y'all, I got that Wiffle ball, bat flip swag in my walk
Down in 'Bama where they grammar got some country in it, y'all
'Nana pudding, prayer chains, tailgates in them jeans ain't no thang
But a chicken wing, nah
(Ain't no thang, but a chicken wing)
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how (show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Your street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow
Said, where the crawdads crawl
Said, living that y'all life, y'all (y'all life, y'all)
