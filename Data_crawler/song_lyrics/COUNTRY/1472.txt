Song Name: Lovin' Where It's Goin'
Lucky song
A song that's got a good groove
You make me wanna slide these boots
Right over closer to you
Like a drink
A drink that goes down smooth
You make me want a lot more of you
Don't know how you do what you do
'Cause I'm loving that look you're giving
Loving the way this is feeling
I'm loving where it's going
Yeah, I'm loving where it's going
Not a word
Not a word to say what your eyes can say
And baby when you talking that way
It's almost more than this old boy can take
'Cause I'm loving that look you're giving
Loving the way this is feeling
Girl, I'm loving where it's going
Yeah, I'm loving where it's going
'Cause I'm loving that look you're giving
Loving the way this is feeling
Girl, I'm loving where it's going
Yeah, I'm loving where it's going
Loving that look you're giving
Loving the way this is feeling
Girl, I'm loving where it's going
Yeah, I'm loving where it's going
Oh baby, yeah
