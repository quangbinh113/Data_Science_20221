Song Name: Stranger
Maybe she was smiling in the mirror
Maybe I was too 'cause I was stoned
Singing every sad song on the jukebox one more time
Honey, they were hitting close to home
And I said, "Maybe this will make you think I'm crazy
Honey, don't feel lonesome if you do
If you want to make a young man happy one more time
I'd sure like to spend the night with you"
And she said, "Stranger, shut off the light and lead me
Somewhere, shut off the shadows too"
And while we lay there making believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you?
Maybe you got all you got together
And maybe you keep rolling like a stone
Maybe some old lonesome song will take you by surprise
And leave you a little more at home
And she said, "Stranger, shut off the light and lead me
Somewhere, shut off the shadows too"
And while we lay there making believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you
And she said, "Stranger, shut off the light and lead me
Somewhere, shut off the shadows too"
And while we lay there making believe...
