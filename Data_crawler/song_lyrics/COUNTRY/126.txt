Song Name: How Do You Like Me Now?!
Yeah, I was always the crazy one broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian
So under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
I only wanted to get your attention
But you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about livin' in your radio
How do you like me now?
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams, and he tore them apart
He never comes home, and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby, with your wake up call
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do like me now? Yeah
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?
Tell me, baby
I will preach on
