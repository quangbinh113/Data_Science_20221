Song Name: A House Made of You
It doesn't take a white dress, it doesn't take a fortress
Nobody needs a ring to fall in love
When I met you it was easy and I held it like a secret
Until the day I couldn't hide it anymore
I want to grow older I want to grow wiser I want to grow flowers
In a house that's made of you
To sit and watch the sunset and get some wrinkles on my forehead
I want to build fires in house that's made of you
It didn't take a long time to know you were the green light
That night you grabbed my hand as we were driving downtown fast
Your daddy had a big scare your mom was sitting right there
We cried as we watched them hold each other close
I want to grow older I want to grow wiser I want to grow flowers
In a house that's made of you
To sit and watch the sunset and get some wrinkles on my forehead
I want to build fires in house that's made of you
We can drive the kids to school read em stories from our bed
Kiss em on their little tiny foreheads
I want to lose touch with what's hip and what's current
I want to go crazy in a house that's made of you
I want to grow older I want to grow wiser I want to grow flowers
In a house that's made of you
To sit and watch the sunset and get some wrinkles on my forehead
I want to build fires in house that's made of you
