Song Name: Long Hot Summer
I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a-comin'
I'm just lying here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm in deep, fallin' deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we're gonna do
Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are
'Cause I need you by my side
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singin' along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
I'm just waitin' on the sun to go down, the sun to go down
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer
In the sun for the first time
I gotta be the one who knows just what to do to you
To get me that smile
One chance of meetin', you were walkin' by me
On the street and I said, "Hi"
And that was the beginnin' of my heart spinnin'
Like these wheels in my head tonight
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singin' along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waitin' on the sun to go down, the sun to go down
The only place that I wanna be is where you are
'Cause any more than a heartbeat away is just too far
Whoa, whoa, whoa
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should be together unh unh uh unh unh uh
All I really want is more than this moment right now
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
And when your holdin' my hand and I look into your eyes
I swear it looks like you're waitin' on the sun to go down
The sun to go down, oou oou
Oh, I swear it looks like you're waitin' on the sun to go down
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh,
Waiting on the sun to go down, oou hoou
Hey, yeah, ooh, I'm loving thinking 'bout you, oou ou
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
