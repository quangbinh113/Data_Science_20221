Song Name: The Devil Went Down to Georgia
Well, the Devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind, he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump, said, "Boy let me tell you what
You probably didn't even know it, but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare, I'll just make a bet with you
Now you play pretty good fiddle boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, I think I'm better than you"
The boy said, "My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'm gon' take your bet, you're gonna regret, I'm the best there's ever been"
Johnny risen up you bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the Devil gets your soul
The Devil opened up his case, and he said, "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from his finger tips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings, and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in, and it sounded something like this
But when the Devil finished, Johnny said, "You know you're pretty good old son
But you just flap down in that chair right there, I'm gonna show you how it's done"
Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the breadpan, picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no
Well, that old Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat'
And he laid that golden fiddle down on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, come on back if you ever want to try again
I done told you once, you son of a gun, I'm the best there's ever been"
He played fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the breadpan a'picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no
