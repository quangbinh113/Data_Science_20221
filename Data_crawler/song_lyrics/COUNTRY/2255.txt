Song Name: Baby I Lied
Did I say I wouldn't be hurt if our love just didn't work?
Did I say that I'd be okay if you said goodbye?
And did I promise you I could take it if we were through
And forget about these feelings inside?
Baby, I lied when I told you I could walk away
Baby, I lied, and forget about the love we made
I swear on my heart I was telling the truth at the time
Baby, I lied, baby, I lied
And did I ever tell myself I could always find someone else?
Did I say if you left today it'd be no surprise?
Did I ever leave any doubt, I could hold up if you walked out?
I know I told you that I could survive
Baby, I lied when I told you I could walk away
Baby, I lied, and forget about the love we made
I swear on my heart I was telling the truth at the time
Baby, I lied, baby, I lied
And now that I can see you walking out of my life
Saying goodbye, I realize, baby, baby, baby
