Song Name: Drivin' My Life Away
Well, the midnight headlight
Find you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead
Slow me down makin' no time
I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers
Slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm
With the song on the radio
I gotta keep rollin'
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Well, the truck stop, cutie
Comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride
Said, I wouldn't be sorry
But she was just a baby
A waitress pour me
Another cup of coffee
Pop it down jack me up
Shoot me out flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the mornin'
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Well, the midnight headlight
Find you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead
Slow me down makin' no time
I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers
Slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm
With the song on the radio
I gotta keep rollin'
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day, yeah
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
