Song Name: Days Go By
I'm changin' lanes and talkin' on the phone
Drivin' way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of comin' in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're comin' undone
Days go by
I can feel them flyin' like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
It's all we've been given
So, you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by
Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights and runnin' through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt we're losin' ourselves
And days go by
I can feel 'em flyin' like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So, you better start livin' right now
And days go by
Yeah, the days go by
We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today
And the days go by
I can feel 'em flyin' like a hand out the window as the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So, you'd better start livin'
You better start livin'
Better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by
I can feel them flyin' like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So, you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by
Yeah, these days go by
Oh, so take 'em by the hand, they're yours and mine
Take 'em by the hand and live your life
Take 'em by the hand, don't let 'em all fly by
Come on
Come on now
Yeah, come on
Don't you know the days go by?
