Song Name: Blue Bayou
I feel so bad, I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Oh, that boy of mine by my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou
