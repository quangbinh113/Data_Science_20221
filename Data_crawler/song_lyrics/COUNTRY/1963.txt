Song Name: Water Under The Bridge
Yeah, yeah
I can't believe this old road ain't washed out
That "No Trespassing" sign is still hangin' around
And it's doin' about as much good now as it did back then
Yeah, you know we used to load up on natty, unleaded, and smokes
Hide from the sheriff and let down our folks
Parked some old Chevy jukebox up here on the bank
Crank it 'til that thing won't crank
That muddy river it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young dumb and so full of it
Broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge
I kissed a girl my buddy used to like
He showed up out here and he wanted to fight
Now I still talk to him but don't know where she is
Guess, it's just water under the bridge
That muddy river it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young dumb and so full of it
Broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge
Just water under the bridge
(Oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, yeah)
That muddy river it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young dumb and so full of it
Yeah, broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge
Oh, just water under the bridge
(Oh, it's just water under the bridge)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
