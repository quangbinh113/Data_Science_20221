Song Name: Summer Heat (with Chase Matthew)
You and me in that summer heat, summer heat
Chattahoochee through the speakers, dancing in the creek
I never wanna leave, never wanna leave
Yeah, yeah
It's already 95, but girl, you make it feel like a hundred out here
Ain't a cloud in the July sky or your sky blue eyes, ain't raining 'round here
But I'm stuck on your love like my truck got hung up in a mud hole
Just dust in the cut, loving up on each other off a back road
You and me in that summer heat, summer heat
Chattahoochee through the speakers, dancing in the creek
I never wanna leave, never wanna leave
Kisses sweeter than the sugar in my momma's sweet tea
Riding 'round downtown on a two-lane
In a two-tone, short bed Chevrolet
You and me, you and me
Baby, you're on fire, girl
Got me loving that summer heat, summer heat
He lighting, lighting up at night
Levi's hung up on limbs to dry
Tattooed love on your left side
I'm tracing yours, you're tracing mine
It's hotter than the flames on the fire that we made
Going red hot crazy, baby
You and me in that summer heat, summer heat
Chattahoochee through the speakers, dancing in the creek
I never wanna leave, never wanna leave
Kisses sweeter than the sugar in my momma's sweet tea
Riding 'round downtown on a two-lane
In a two-tone, short bed Chevrolet
You and me, you and me
Baby, you're on fire, girl
Got me loving that summer heat, summer heat (Yeah)
You and me in the summer heat, summer heat
Girl, I'm stuck on your love like my truck got hung up in a mud hole
Just dust in the cut, loving up on each other off a back road
You and me in that summer heat, summer heat
Chattahoochee through the speakers, dancing in the creek
I never wanna leave, never wanna leave
Kisses sweeter than the sugar in my momma's sweet tea
Riding 'round downtown on a two-lane
In a two-tone, short bed Chevrolet
You and me, you and me
Baby, you're on fire, girl
Got me loving that summer heat, summer heat (Yeah)
I'm loving that summer heat, summer heat
You and me in the summer heat, summer heat
