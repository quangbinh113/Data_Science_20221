Song Name: The Captain's Daughter
I'm a poor boy as you know
But I love the Captain's daughter so
If I begged her would she go?
Or would she tell me no, no, no, no, no
Daddy is a sailor man
Your fresh from the farm land
He said when you ask my hand
For me to tell you no, no, no, no, no
Your daddy's gone away to sea
You're as lovely as can be

Come and go away with me

Oh, don't you tell me no, no, no, no, no
My daddy owns a clipper ship
He brings me pearls on every trip
Pink champagne for me to sip
And you're the poorest boy I know, know, know, know, know
I've got no pearls to give you
I've got two arms and heart that's true
We could start with a dream or two
Oh won't you say you'll go, go
The poor boy came from the farm land
She was the daughter of a sailor man

The Captain says 'When he begs your hand

You better tell him no, no, no, no, no'
She said 'Papa don't you worry please
The poor begs me upon his knees
I'd never leave this life of ease'
And with the poor boy goes
The captain kissed her and he went to sea
The poor boy said 'Go away with me
You're lonely and you shouldn't be
Oh, don't you tell me no, no, no, no, no'
My daddy owns a clipper ship
He brings me pearls on every trip
Pink champagne for me to sip
And you're the poorest boy I know, know, know, know, know
Your daddy's given you a home
But you've got nobody when he is gone
I'll go and leave you all alone
If the answer is still no, no
