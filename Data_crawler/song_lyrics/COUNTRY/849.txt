Song Name: Loving Time of the Year
Time's gone closer, it's just around the corner
The day that we've looked forward to is near
We get caught up in the season
And smile for no good reason
It's that loving time of the year
I wish that I could bottle up this feeling
Pass it out a little everyday
'Cause all the scars of pain has started healing
And troubles of this world just fade away
So let's give thanks to our Lord up in heaven
For filling our hearts up with Christmas cheer
Take the time to pull our loved ones closer
In this loving time of the year
I can picture Christmas snowing
The old folks still be yawning
But sleepy eyes won't last long around here
Soon every place is glowing
No way to keep from showing
This loving time of the year
I wish that I could bottle up all this feeling
Pass it out a little everyday
'Cause all the scars of pain has started healing
Troubles of this world just fade away
So let's give thanks to our Lord up in heaven
For filling our hearts up with Christmas cheer
Take the time to pull our loved ones closer
In this loving time of the year
In this loving time of the year
In this loving time of the year
