Song Name: Downtown Baby
Every time I look at you, have to do a double take
'Cause you're a kaleidoscope of Kristofferson, Bob Dylan and John Wayne
Been swallowed by suburbia, it's got nothing left to give and I
Think that we both know this isn't how we wanna live, oh, no
And I've been dreamin'
And I need a change of scenery
Take me downtown baby, hit the concrete
Pull me close and kiss in the street
Downtown baby, downtown baby, yeah
Only you can take me higher than high
I just wanna live 'til I die
Downtown baby, downtown baby
Hey, ay-ay
Hey, ay-ay
I'm blinded by the buzzin' lights and adolescent appetites
I'm singing K-Pop karaoke, thanking God no one here knows me
Laughing on a late-night bus, nightmares and angel dust
And I look at you and you know what? There's no one here but us
I've got a feeling
You're feeling like I'm feeling
Take me downtown baby, hit the concrete
Pull me close and kiss in the street
Downtown baby, downtown baby
Only you can take me higher than high
I just wanna live 'til I die
Downtown baby, downtown baby
Hey, ay-ay (only you can take me higher)
Hey, ay-ay
Hey, ay-ay (only you can take me higher)
Hey, ay-ay
I don't wanna wake up alone
We got nowhere else to go
So, let's go
Only you can take me higher
Downtown baby, hit the concrete
Pull me close and kiss in the street
Downtown baby, downtown baby
Hey, ay-ay
Hey, ay-ay
Only you can take me higher, ooh
Hey, ay-ay
