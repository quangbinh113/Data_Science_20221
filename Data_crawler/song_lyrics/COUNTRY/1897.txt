Song Name: Sunday Toasted
Clocked out
Now I'm en route
It's about summer time
Been waiting all damn week
There's one thing on my mind
Yeah I'm thinking bout tan lines
And moonshine
It goes down easily
Night rides
In moonlight
A Koozy on my knee
Cold beer in the yeti
Beckies on deck
In the dirty waters
We'll be speeding
Falling off jets
No shirt no blue collar
Out of touch
Ain't no service
Soak it up
Sunday toasted
Lake house party down south
You just don't know what you're Missing
Pull out from the dock
Three deep
Speed boat headed out your way
Line it up
Let the speaker bleed
Got the girls choosing what to Play
We bumping the Nelly, Aldean, Country rnb
Waiting all week to kick back and Release
Leave me on the table cause
I'm heating up
We can run it back
Wanna test your luck
Shoot behind the back
It's a double cup
One more shot I'm on fire
Re-rack that I'm a gentleman
Who's got next you can send em In
Better get ready cuz I'm running it
Let's get f*ked
Cold beer in the yeti
Beckies on deck
In the dirty waters
We'll be speeding
Falling off jets
No shirt no blue collar
Out of touch
Ain't no service
Soak it up
Sunday toasted
Lake house party down south
You just don't know what you're Missing
