Song Name: Pitchin' fits
Tell me, can you save me?
I think I've fallen sick
I have grown to be so angry
And I just can't call it quits
Tell me I'm not crazy
And we all feel like this
I've been so down here lately
Tell me I'm just pitchin' fits
'Cause it's a long and hurtful phase
And I don't know if I belong here at all
But when I'm here with you
I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
So tell me I'm still breathing
I'm gonna be okay
Tell me you're still here
And you won't ever go away
Tell me I'm not dying
Just need to get some rest
And tell me all this trying
Will pay off in the end
'Cause it's a long and hurtful phase
And I don't know if I belong here at all
But when I'm here with you
I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
Tell me all these things
That I cannot tell myself
Tell me you don't think
That I need to get some help
Tell me that you love me
Just tell me one more time
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Just open up my eyes
'Cause it's a long and hurtful phase
And I don't know if I belong here at all
But when I'm here with you
I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
Oh, when I'm here with you
I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
