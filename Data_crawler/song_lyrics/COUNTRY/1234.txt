Song Name: You - Acoustic
Ooh, ooh
Baby, standin' here with you
With your arms around my shoulders
We're dancin' with the moon
And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I got you
You and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
You and only you
Baby, lookin' in your eyes
It's like we're in slow motion
Just you and me tonight
And baby, you lean in for a kiss
And I know, and I know, and I know that
It don't get better than this
'Cause I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I got you
You and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
You and only you
I got forever
And I got all I'll ever need
'Cause I got you, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I got you
You and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
Baby, I got you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You and only you
