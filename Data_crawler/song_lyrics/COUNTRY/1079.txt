Song Name: Pure Love
Pure love
Baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch
And you in the morning
Pure love
Baby it's pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds
Percent pure love
I wake up with sunshine
(Sunshine)
Laying beside me
And bluebirds singing right outside my window
Soft warm kisses (kisses)
Say good morning
Then I get breakfast in bed
You know you make me so happy (make me so happy)
Pure love
Baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch
And you in the morning
Pure love
You're the picture of pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds
Percent pure love
Pure love
Baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch
And you in the morning
Pure love
You're the picture of pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds
Percent pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds
Percent pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds
Percent pure lov-ov-ove
