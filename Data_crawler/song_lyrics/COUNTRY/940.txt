Song Name: November Air
You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
Make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
Said his life took most of you
Gave you twice and the day was through
You said it all turned out awfully fair
So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by
Breathin' in that cold November air
No one was there
No one was there
When no one was there
Two kids 'bout 23 when the sun sets you'll never see
You were yellin' "Supper" from the yard
And they grew old and sailed away
Call you on phones from far away
Wrote you novels on postcards
And all you ever wanted was to see your children fly
Maybe one day they're stars
But there ain't no leavin' this small town this evenin'
You can't even drive your own car
Through November air
Through November air
Through November air
Dear Ma, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Ma, they were wonderful
All of the sights you'll never see
And dear Ma, if I could hold you
I'd grab you by the arms, tell you what it means
You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something
Tell us what you wanted to, and all we did, we needed you
Your dreams were too small to care
But I'm always reminded, if you look hard you'll find it
Memory gives warmth to right here
Through November air
Through November air
Through November air
Dear Ma, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Ma, they were wonderful
All of the sights you'll never see
And dear Ma, if I could hold you
I'd grab you by the arms, tell you what it means
You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something
You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
