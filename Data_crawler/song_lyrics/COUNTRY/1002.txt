Song Name: Cheap Suit
There's a man in a cheap suit
Holding a beer can
Standing on his back porch
Looking out past the highway
The sun is going down
In a field of dry corn
And the slider keeps catching
And the screen is torn
His tie is loose
His socks are thin
He shakes the can once
And goes back in
He walks between his children
And the television glow
To the kitchen for another
To the living room alone
There's a knock-off Gibson
Leaning in the corner
Where he left it the last time
He felt like this
He pushes on the tuners
With his eyes shut tight
Runs out a figure with his left hand
Until the chord sounds right
When he sings he looks so far away
Like there's something
He almost remembers
And doesn't know how to say
I see him from the doorway
I see that look in his eye
And I know I'm going to go there
Where my father's dreams lie
