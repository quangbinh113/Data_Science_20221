Song Name: Stone
Well the night is my companion
And the highway is my home

Got me seeking for one last beacon
Every single place I roam
They say Jesus was a poor man
I guess I wish I had a little more him in me
Make it easier going on living
Heart ache and misery
Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Or have you turned to stone?
Well I guess I got my bottle
I still hold it all the time
But it keeps me smiling and singing
Helps me fall asleep a little bit better at night
They say life is like a dagger
Backstage is full of parasites
They love you and drain of everything you own
Just to feel better about their life
Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Or have you turned to stone?
Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Sweet, sweet love of mine, I'm going to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Or have you turned to stone?
