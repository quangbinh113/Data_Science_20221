Song Name: Highway
I need to get out of the city for a minute
I need to turn off my phone
Yeah, nobody in this race is gonna win it
So why not run off on my own?
I'm gonna stare at a fire 'til the coals burn down
At the edge of the world where there's no one around
Break through all the hustle for the rustle of that big empty sound
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
Drop me in the middle of nowhere or where big sky is all I see
I'm gonna break the repetition
Lose some recognition
And everybody's startin' to sound like politicians
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
They need you right now
It can't wait
They pile more and more onto your plate
'Til I can't even see the stars for the buildings in the way
When was the last time I caught my breath
I walk a hard line 'til there's nothin' left
I think it's high time I push this all off my chest
I'm gonna stare at a fire 'til the coals burn down
At the edge of the world where there's no one around
Break through all the hustle for the rustle of that big empty sound
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
Drop me in the middle of nowhere or where big sky is all I see
I'm gonna break the repetition
Lose some recognition
And everybody's startin' to sound like politicians
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
Drop me in the middle of nowhere or where big sky is all I see
I'm gonna break the repetition
Lose some recognition
When everybody's startin' to sound like politicians
Baby, I just need to go someplace
Where I can't hear the highway
Where I can't hear the highway
No, I can't hear the highway
I don't wanna hear that highway
