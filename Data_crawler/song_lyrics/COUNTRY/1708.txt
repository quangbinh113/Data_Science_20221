Song Name: Stubborn Pride
Don't keep my boots by the door no more
There's nowhere I need to be that fast
People keep asking what I settled down for
Finally found something I wanna make last
My stubborn pride
Laying on the floor
Burn every bridge
I've built before
You pulled me from the fire
So I won't face the flames alone
And gave this gypsy heart
The only home it's ever known
Never planned on making it quite this far
It's a hard road sleeping on white lines
Paint a neon smile just to cover all my scars
I was always twelve steps behind
My stubborn pride
Laying on the floor
Burn every bridge
I've built before
You pulled me from the fire
So I won't face the flames alone
And gave this gypsy heart
The only home it's ever known
You're a most unlikely angel
That saved me from myself
Heaven knows I need you, baby
Can't get high on nothing else
My stubborn pride
Laying on the floor
Burn every bridge
I've built before
You pulled me from the fire
So I won't face the flames alone
And gave this gypsy heart
The only home it's ever known
