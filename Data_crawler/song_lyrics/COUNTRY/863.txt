Song Name: Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be far away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now
(Here we are as in olden days)
(Happy golden days of yore)
(Faithful friends who are dear to us)
(Gather near to us once more)
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough (highest bough)
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now
