Song Name: Still Woman Enough (feat. Reba McEntire & Carrie Underwood)
Well, I've been through some bad times
Been on the bottom, been at the top
And I've seen life from both sides
It's what you make with what you've got
There's been times life's got me down
Pick myself up and bounce right back around
I wasn't raised to give up
And to this day, you know what
I'm still woman enough, still got what it takes inside
I know how to love, lose, and survive
Ain't much I ain't seen and I ain't tried
Been knocked down but never out of the fight
I'm strong but I'm tender, wise but I'm tough
And let me tell you when it comes to love
I'm still woman enough
I was raised in Oklahoma
Hey, I'm country, proud to say
I've seen a lot of changes
Oh, but I ain't never changed
Well, this here girl's been there and done that
They called me hillbilly, but I got the last laugh
Standing here today, proving in every way
I'm still woman enough, still got what it takes inside
I know how to love, lose, and survive
Ain't much I ain't seen, I ain't tried
I've been knocked down but never out of the fight
I'm strong but I'm tender, wise but I'm tough
And let me tell you when it comes to love
I'm still woman enough
The years may come and go
But for me it's just time
'Cause without a doubt I know
It ain't your age, it's your state of mind
I'm still woman enough, still got what it takes inside
I know how to love, lose, and survive
Ain't much I ain't seen, I ain't tried
I've been knocked down but never out of the fight
I'm strong but I'm tender, wise but I'm tough
And let me tell you when it comes to love
I'm still woman enough (still woman enough)
I'm still woman enough (still woman enough)
I'm still woman enough (still woman enough)
I'm still woman enough
I'm still woman enough (still woman enough)
I'm still woman enough
