Song Name: Yours If You Want It
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
'Cause it's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up
Banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up
Banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain
Every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up
Banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it
Oh, oh
Where every dollar, every dime
Every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby your name is written on it
Baby it's yours if you want it
