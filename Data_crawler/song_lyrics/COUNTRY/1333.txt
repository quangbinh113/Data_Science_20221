Song Name: How Bout We Don't
We did the break up, we did the make up
The don't call, don't text, don't pick up
I did my best to stay away from you
Gave you time, gave you space like you wanted me to
But here we are at the same bar
We said we wouldn't, but here we are
Back at it again, little more than friends
The story never ends
Weshould probably close out and call it a night
I should probably quit gettin' lost in your eyes
But tonight, we're both a little lonely
Little buzzed, little caught up in the moment
We should probably stop kissin' in your drive way
