Song Name: Kill a Man
How many heartbreaks does it take to kill a man
No need for concern just askin' for a friend
And how many times can you say you're leavin'
And how many years will you keep on deceiving before you're gone
A lot of shits opened my mind up these days
And I can't believe I got stuck in your ways
And you can keep tossin' and turnin'
Believing that I'd be the one that never got away
Well how many shots can I take before I black out
Way more than I thought cause you're on my mind now
And how many times a day do you think of me
What we once were we will never be
A lot of shits opened my mind up these days
And I still can't believe I got stuck in your ways
And you can keep tossin' and turnin'
Believing that I'd be the one that never got away
You say that you love me but I ain't me anymore
And you can have the bed babe I'm good on the floor
And you'll fall asleep and I'll go on down to the bar
Cause who really gives a fuck if I wreck your car
A lot of shits opened my mind up these days
And I still can't believe I got stuck in your ways
And you can keep tossin' and turnin' believing
I'd be the one that never got away
How many heartbreaks does it take to kill a man
