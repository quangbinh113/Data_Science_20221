Song Name: Breaking News
You look like you just saw a ghost when we walked in
And all I did was say, "Hello, how you been?"
You look right through me like I'm someone you don't know
You look like you just saw a ghostã…¤
What's got you starin' at us?
The dress she's wearin' or the fact that we showed up?
Don't act like you didn't know
She was there when you let me go
Can't lie, say you hadn't heard
That I've been over you since I met her
Sometimes, the grapevine lies
But this time, it's all true
Don't forget you're the one who said we were through
Don't act like it's breakin' news
Don't act like it's breakin' news
You look like you could use a drink the way you're actin'
What did you expect of me? What did you think would happen?
'Cause you seein' somebody else with me makes it seem like you miss me
You look like you could use a drink (just don't cause a scene)
Don't act like you didn't know
She was there when you let me go
Can't lie, say you hadn't heard
That I've been over you since I met her
Sometimes, the grapevine lies
But this time, it's all true
Don't forget you're the one who said we were through
Don't act like it's breakin' news
Don't act like it's breakin' news
Don't act like you didn't know
She was there when you let me go
You can't lie, say you hadn't heard
That I've been over you since I met her
Sometimes, the grapevine lies
But this time, it's all true
Don't forget you're the one who said we were through
Don't act like it's breakin' news
Don't act like it's breakin' news
Don't act like it's breakin' news
