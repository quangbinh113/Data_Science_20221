Song Name: New Year
It's a minute to midnight
New Year's here
Dressed up for no one
At the party
I could call you up
But
They're starting the countdown
It's way too late
Pouring the champagne
You'd never make it in time
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Everybody's got someone
Happy New Year, baby
Where ever you are
Are you thinking of me?
And i don't wanna feel like this,
I don't wanna miss you
Wish you were holding me
Right here
Kissing in the New Year
It's a minute to midnight
Another year had gone
That i couldn't tell you,
That your the only one
That i'll ever want
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
I wonder if you've got someone?
Happy New Year, baby
Where ever you are
Are you thinking of me?
And i don't wanna feel like this,
I don't wanna miss you
Wish you were holding me
Right here
Kissing in the New Year
What if i leave this party?
What if i follow my heart?
Straight to where you are
Say happy New Year, baby
Here i am,
Were you thinking of me?
Happy New Year, baby
Where ever you are
Are you thinking of me?
And i don't wanna feel like this,
I don't wanna miss you
Wish you were holding me
Right here
Kissing in the New Year
Maybe next year
We'll be right here
Kissing in the New Year
