Song Name: Somewhere In My Car
Mm-mm-mm
I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright 'cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin' there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I know you're with someone else
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh-oh-oh-oh
So, I've been sleeping 'til noon, in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I know you're never coming back
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh-oh-oh-oh (if l could bring it back)
In my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (mm-mm-mm)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (if I could bring it back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (mm-mm-mm)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I just close my eyes)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh, I could feel your breathing baby)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (fingertips slide up and down my back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
