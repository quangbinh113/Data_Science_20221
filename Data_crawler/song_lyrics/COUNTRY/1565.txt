Song Name: Walkin' After Midnight
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way of saying I love you
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere
A-walking after midnight searching for me
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere
A-walking after midnight searching for me
