Song Name: Between Jennings And Jones
I left Montgomery on North 65
I was restless and ready to give Nashville a try
I rolled into town with a sound of my own
Somewhere between Jennings and Jones
Well, the day job I landed felt just like a jail
I couldn't seem to break out with that hammer and nails
And I spent all my nights in some old honky-tonk
Somewhere between Jennings and Jones
Hanging out in the bars with the drunks and the stars I found a few good ole boys just like me
Started burning our candles both ends and the middle a bunch of roaring outlaws at high speed
And they said that the end of that road I was on
Somewhere between Jennings and Jones
Well, some record executives found me on night
I was singing half-lit, they said it sounded just right (right)
They put my name on an album but they shelved all my songs
Said I was somewhere between Jennings and Jones
Hanging out in the bars with the drunks and the stars
And a few good ole boys just like me
Started burning our candles both ends and the middle a bunch of roaring outlaws at high speed
And they said that the end of that road I was on
Somewhere between Jennings and Jones
Now to find me in a record store won't take you long
I'm right there between Jennings and Jones
