Song Name: Where I Wanna Be
Flew to California, drove to Alabam'
Hitched to Wichita, caught a ride in a van
Paddled in a boat and peddled on a bike
I've walked, I've swum, I've crawled, I've hiked
I've hopped a train to Maine and a bus to the Keys
Chased her all night in my dreams
One look at her and it's easy to see
Wherever she is, is where I wanna be, yeah
Ooh, like a moth to a flame
Ooh I hear her call my name
And I'm down, I'm game, I'm in, I'm free
Wherevеr she is that's where I wanna bе
Yeah, rollin' with the boys, road trippin' in a car
Or just kicking back, drinking beer in a bar
Rolling dice on the strip and coming up sevens
In a room full of tens, brother she's an eleven
Yeah, nowhere Kansas, take my chances
At wherever south of France is
Singing with Elvis, Memphis blue
On a sidewalk whistling a Saskatoo
Like a moth to a flame
I hear her callin' my name
And I'm down, I'm game, I'm in, I'm free
Wherever she is that's where I wanna be
Yeah, rolling through Kansas, Kansas City
Drippin' like molasses in Mississippi
That's where I wanna be
Yeah, we just rolling through Kansas, Kansas City baby
Yeah, drippin' like molasses in Mississippi, baby
Yeah, like a moth to a flame (moth to a flame)
I hear you calling my name, baby (calling my name)
