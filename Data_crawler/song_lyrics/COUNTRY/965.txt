Song Name: Lost in Your Love
Mmm yeah
I know that money's tight
This might sound crazy
But we should book a flight
Somewhere amazing
We only got one life, so let's not waste it
I'm talking about tonight
What you say baby?
We could lay low in Ibiza
That golden sand
Or just take it easy in the south of France
We could wander forever and never be found
I was lost in your love
When the sun goes down
Lost in your love
When the sun goes down
I've been feeling kind of stuck
In the same location
Let's get a couple stamps
In these passport pages
No I don't really care
About the destination
Yeah I just want you there
That's all I'm saying
We can dance all night in Rio at Carnival
Drink too much tequila and forget it all
We could wander forever and never be found
I was lost in your love
When the sun goes down
Lost in your love
When the sun goes down
(Mmm yeah)
I'm lost in your love
We can hide out in Havana
Spend all our cash
On cigars and mojitos
And don't look back
We could wander forever and never be found
I was lost in your love
When the sun goes down
Girl I want you forever
Let's leave right now
I was lost in your love
When the sun goes down
Lost in your love
When the sun goes down

I'm lost in your love
(Yeah)
Girl I'm lost in your love
