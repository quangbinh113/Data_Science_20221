Song Name: Don't Tell Me What To Do
We tried and we tried, but it's over
Guess I didn't fit the image in your mind
Now you tell me to find another lover
Oh, but baby, aren't you gettin' out of line
Don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So, don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
You're no longer in charge of my thinking
You're already in love with someone else
So, if I'm into all night honky tonkin'
Well, I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself
So, don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So, don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
So, don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So, don't tell me what to do
Well, I'll love you forever if I want to
