Song Name: Why
I saw you downtown
Through the glow of my tail lights
You were stopped behind me
Your car had caught my eye
I'm glad this light's slow
Gimme a chance to catch my breath
Right before I drive away to forget
Why do I give a damn after everything went south?
Why do I write songs, why can't my heart shut its mouth?
Why can't I move on and give a fair chance to someone new?
Why can't I fall out of love with you?
And I've tried pretty
I tried outgoing and fun
And I've tried intelligent
Trust me, I tried dumb
I tried wealthy
I've been looked at as a way out
I've tried everything I know to try out
And why do I give a damn after everything went south?
Why do I write songs, why can't my heart shut its mouth?
Why can't I move on and give a fair chance to someone new?
Why can't I fall out of love with you?
Why do I give a damn after everything went south?
Why do I write songs, why can't my heart shut its damn mouth?
Can't I move on and give a fair chance to someone new?
Why can't I fall out of love with you?
Why can't I fall out of love?
