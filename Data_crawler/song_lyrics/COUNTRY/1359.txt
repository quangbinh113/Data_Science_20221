Song Name: She Loves Jesus
She was the preacher's daughter
Baptized in water
Lord knows what she saw in me
She's never been to a holler
'Cause her daddy taught her
That boys down in Tennessee
Ain't nothing but trouble with bad intentions
But us 'round here we were raised a little different
She's got something that I've never seen
She takes her Bible with her everywhere
When she walks in there's something in the air
She's been hurting, she's been left no reason
I ain't perfect but one thing's for sure
If one door closes it'll open more
She might be the one thing I've been needing
And it looks like I might've found my missing pieces
I love her 'cause she loves Jesus
I can see us under steeple
With all of our people
And her in that wedding dress
In sickness, in health
No matter the wealth
Loving her 'til my last breath
I know the Good Book says that love is patient
I guess you never know just who might need saving
So she takes her Bible with her everywhere
When she walks in there's something in the air
She's been hurting, she's been left no reason
I ain't perfect but one thing's for sure
If one door closes it'll open more
She might be the one thing I've been needing
And it looks like I might've found my missing pieces
I love her 'cause she loves Jesus
I can see forever in her eyes
This whole time, a blessing in disguise
So she takes her Bible with her everywhere
When she walks in there's something in the air
She's been hurt, she's been left no reason
I ain't perfect but one thing's for sure
If one door closes it'll open more
She might be the only thing I've been needing
And it looks like I might've found my missing pieces
I love her 'cause she loves Jesus
'Cause she loves Jesus
