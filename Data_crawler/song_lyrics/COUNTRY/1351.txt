Song Name: Watching Love Leave
It's one key in the drawer, one in the ignition
Two feet out the door, three words missing
Hope you find what you're looking for
We fell hard, but we fell short
But it hurts to give up, hurts to keep hurting
And I washed your favorite shirt, one thing's for certain
We tried, baby, didn't we?
I never thought I'd be
Watching love leave
Sitting on a front porch swing, got his truck packed up
There it goes down the road
With his stuff and my heart and our plans and our dreams
Leaving on a one-way street, nothing left to say
There it goes down the road
'Cause you know when you know
When you're watching love leave
It ain't slamming doors, crying and screaming
It ain't saying mean things we don't mean
It ain't nobody's fault
Sure ain't what I thought
Watching love leave
Sitting on a front porch swing, got his truck packed up
There it goes down the road
With his stuff and my heart and our plans and our dreams
Leaving on a one-way street, nothing left to say
There it goes down the road
'Cause you know when you know
When you're watching love leave
Watching love leave
Yeah, we tried, baby, didn't we?
Still don't make it easy
Watching love leave
Sitting on a front porch swing, got his truck packed up
There it goes down the road
With his stuff and my heart and our plans and our dreams
Leaving on a one-way street, nothing left to say
There it goes down the road
'Cause you know when you know
When you're watching love leave
There it goes down the road
'Cause you know when you know
When you're watching love leave
