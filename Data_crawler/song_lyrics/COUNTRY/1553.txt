Song Name: Jambalaya (On The Bayou) - Single Version
Well, goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh, my oh
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Well, jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
I'm gonna pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Well, son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin'
Kinfolks come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Yeah, dressed in style and go hog wild, me oh, my oh
Well, son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Well, jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
I'm gonna pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Well, son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Settle down far from town get me a pirogue
And I'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Gonna spend my money gettin' Yvonne what she need-o
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Well, jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
I'm gonna pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Well, son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
