Song Name: Except for Monday
You look surprised, you didn't think you'd see me
Kicking up my heels, painting up this town
When you said goodbye, I learned a couple new dances
Cast a couple of glances, I'm on a big roll now
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway
Tuesday, I get a little sideways
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it, Saturday's gone
But it's Sunday now and you can bet that I'm alright
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always this easy
Getting over you, got a little rough on me
It didn't take too long, 'til I got it together
And everyday I thank my lucky stars, you set me free
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway
Tuesday, I get a little sideways
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it, Saturday's gone
But it's Sunday now, and you can bet that I'm alright
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway
Tuesday, I get a little sideways
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it, Saturday's gone
But it's Sunday now and you can bet that I'm alright
It's Sunday now and everything's alright
