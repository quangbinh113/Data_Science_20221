Song Name: Long Black Train
There's a long black train comin' down the line
Feedin' off the souls that are lost and cryin'
Rails of sin only evil remains
Watch out brother for that long black train
Look to the heavens you can look to the sky
You can find redemption starin' back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burnin' your ticket for that long black train
'Cause there's vict'ry in the Lord I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train

There's an engineer on that long black train
Makin' you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a waitin' on your heart to say
Let me ride on that long black train
'Cause there's vict'ry in the Lord I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
Well I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty makin' everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere
'Cause there's vict'ry in the Lord I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
I said cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
Ya watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a drivin' that long black train
