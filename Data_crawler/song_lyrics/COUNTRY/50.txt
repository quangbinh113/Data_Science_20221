Song Name: That's What Tequila Does
It don't take too much
To get the wheels turning 'round and 'round in my head
Top shelf or Cuervo
I know it's gonna stir up every memory she left
Still burns, I can't lie
When I think about the good before goodbye
Guess that's what I'm drinking on tonight
It'll make you think that you got a shot
At the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
It sneaks up on you
Going out for one, turns into 2 a.m.
You know what's next, get you looking for a text
Get you checking your phone again
Make you stay all night, it'll give you a million reasons why
It'll make you think that you got a shot
At the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Oh-oh
Yeah, that's what tequila does
Oh-oh
It still burns, I can't lie (I can't lie)
Oh, guess that's what I'm drinking on tonight (oh, whoa)
It'll make you think that you got a shot
At the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Oh-oh
Yeah, that's what tequila does
