Song Name: Oklahoma Smokeshow
Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old pickup truck
You've got nowhere to go, although, you're all gussied up
There's so much whiskey in his coke, it'll make her nose bend
But she swears that his love is a damn Godsend
She's known God since she was a child
She used to play in the yard and she would dream of one day
'Til the world came around and took her dreamin' away
Told her how to dress and act and smile
She's an Oklahoma smokeshow
He's an asshole from back home
She'll never make it out alive
That small town bar scene
Where small vices kill your big dreams
He'd take you home but he's too drunk to drive
I'll be here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small town smokeshow
Well, I'll be here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small town smokeshow
Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old pickup truck
You've got nowhere to go, although, you're all gussied up
