Song Name: Home On the Range
Oh, give me a home, where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the Range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
How often at night when the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars
Have I stood there amazed and I ask as I gaze
If their glory exceeds that of ours?
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
