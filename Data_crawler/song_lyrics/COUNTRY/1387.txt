Song Name: Are We On Fire
I've noticed that we've gotten good with pain and smiles
I think you know what I've known for a while now
It's time to get it out

There's no doubt that in the end it's gonna hurt
But it's gotta happen
So who makes the first move
I'll let you choose
Is it my fault, is it your fault, girl, who's to blame?
Is everything we worked for going up in flames?
Is this house burning down all around us?
We'd both be better off without it
'Cause you say that you love me
I never call you a liar
'Cause it's just me, or are we on fire?
So tell me how you want this whole thing to fall
You call me every name and blame me, oh
That's how it's gotta be
Yeah, 'cause when you're this far, and there ain't no looking back
I just fly against the wind
Will you light the match?
Is it my fault, is it your fault, girl, who's to blame?
Is everything we worked for going up in flames?
Is this house burning down all around us?
We'd both be better off without it
'Cause you say that you love me
And I never call you liar
Is it just me, or we're on fire? Burning higher
Baby, maybe I'm the gas, and maybe you're the ladder
Maybe you're the ladder
'Cause no need to pull out when we're safe in
You can't be all bad from a cracked foundation
Is it my fault, is it your fault, girl, who's to blame?
Is everything we worked for going up in flames?
Is this house burning down all around us?
We'd both be better off without it
'Cause you say that you love me
Who'd have think you a liar?
'Cause it's just me, or are we on fire?
