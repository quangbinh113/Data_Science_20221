Song Name: I Don't Want This Night To End
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get outta town
Got the stars comin' out
Over my hood
And all I know now
Is it's going good
You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly loosin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot and
I don't know what road we're on or where we've been
From starin' at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
Gonna cuss the morning, when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain't no good for me
Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss
Clock on the dash
Says 3:35
There's plenty of gas
And the night's still alive
You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly loosin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot and
I don't know what road we're on or where we've been
From starin' at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly loosin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot and
I don't know what road we're on or where we've been
From starin' at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
I don't want this night to end
No, I don't want this night to end
