Song Name: Fly over States
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk, killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousands feet above, could be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
They've never drove through Indiana
Met a man who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made those fly overstates
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flat bed cowboy stacking US steel on a three-day haul
Road and rails under their feet
Yeah, that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a wind shield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'd think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those fly overstates
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
Might even want to plant your stakes
In those fly overstates (yeah)
Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride
