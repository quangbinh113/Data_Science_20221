Song Name: Boy From Anderson County
Sometimes, I look at her
I go back to 17 and her in that Green Day T-shirt
She had no idea I'd waited eight years to kiss her
And man, it's crazy
She's given me a reason to live and a couple of babies
I've been wishin' I could stop time a lot here lately
'Cause, man, she made me
She made me better, she made me stronger
She made me want this dream so bad
'Cause she made me wish that forever wasn't all the time we had
She showed me every single thing I didn't know about me
And I thank God every day that that girl found me
'Cause He made a plan, she made a choice
They made a man out of a boy from Anderson County
Man, just look at me
There ain't nowhere or no one else I'd wanna be
Yeah, I promise ain't no one else in the world more lucky
Yeah, trust me
'Cause she made me better, she made me stronger
She made me want this dream so bad
She made me wish that forever wasn't all the time we had
She showed me every single thing I didn't know about me
And I thank God every day that that girl found me
'Cause He made a plan, she made a choice
They made a man out of a boy from Anderson County
Oh, she's a stealer of the covers
She's a daughter, she's a mother
She was put down here on Earth
For this old boy to love her
She made me better, she made me stronger
She made me want this dream so bad
She made me wish that forever wasn't all the time we had
She showed me every single thing I didn't know about me
And I thank God every day that that girl found me
'Cause He made a plan, she made a choice
They made a man out of a boy from Anderson County
A boy from Anderson County
