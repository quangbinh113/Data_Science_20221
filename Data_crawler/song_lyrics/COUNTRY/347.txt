Song Name: More Girls Like You
Well, I've been livin' like a wild old mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might've earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From goin' and rollin' too far
Runnin' and gunnin' a little too hard
So unreigned, so untamed, yeah
So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you
Your soul is pure golden
Must've been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah,
God made Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few. Yeah
More girls like you...

More girls like you
It's been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn't make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah. God made Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few.
Yeah ah. More girls like you
Yeah ah. More girls like you
Yeah ah. More girls like you
Yeah ah. Yeah ah
Yeah ah. Yeah ah
More girls like you. Yeah ah
More girls like you. Yeah ah
