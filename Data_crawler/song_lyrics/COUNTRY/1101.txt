Song Name: Next Girl
Hey next girl, you don't know me
I'm just the one he says went crazy on him
That's just what he does
But once upon a time I was
The next girl, I've been where you're at
You overlook a lot when he looks like that
He'll charm your mama with that smile
Hide the red flags for a little while
I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car, I bet
He said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to get you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're the best thing
But I know what happens next, girl
Hey next girl, you think that you know better
Maybe the last girl was just a little bitter
And jaded, yeah, there ain't no doubt
But if he ever talks about the ex-girl
She tried like hell, it was too late to save herself
So now she's just trying to help the next girl
I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car, I bet
He said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to get you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're the best thing
But I know what happens next
You're gonna think it's all your fault
It's just a switch that he turns off
He'll make you think it's love
But I promise you, it's not
Oh no, it's not, no
Oh, I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car, I bet
He said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to get you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're the best thing
But I know what happens next, girl
