Song Name: Back To The Beginning
In the Beginning
Hold me close to your chest
Say that you will not rest
Until you're right here, till you are right here
Say that you'll never leave
That you'll be caring for me
Like in the beginning, When we were winning
And the summer sun was coming up
And the nights were never long enough
In the beginning ahhhh
No far away place was too far
We could always find our way there
In the beginning, in the beginning
Now the days are short, nights are long
But we could still pres re-start
Back to the beginning, when we were winning
And the summer sun was, coming up
And the nights were never long enough
In the beginning aaahhhh
Could we retrace our steps
Perhaps, wind back our minds
And try to remember, being two of a kind
Maybe we were just kids, but we were doing things right
Can you remember, what it felt like
In the Beginning aaahhh
Hold me close to your chest, say that you will not rest
Until you're right here, till you are right here
