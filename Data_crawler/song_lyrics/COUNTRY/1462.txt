Song Name: Ranch Girl Dream
Small town bar, passing through
But just gonna have me
A lonely one or two
Then she came walking in
And stole the life out of my breath
Little people on my shoulder
Telling me to move in
She wore them Navajo pearls and a turquoise ring
Hair tied up high and holes in her jeans
And I said to myself, "Oh, this is all I'll ever need"
My little ranch girl dream, yeah, ranch girl dream, yeah
Make your bets and poke your fun
But don't try to tell me that she ain't the one
Well, I bet that she's a handful
That's a risk I'm willing to take
Well, a woman like that
Is worth more than any money I'll ever make
She wore them Navajo pearls and a turquoise ring
Hair tied up high and holes in her jeans
And I said to myself, "Oh, this is all I'll ever need"
My little ranch girl dream, yeah, ranch girl dream, yeah
Have I seen her before
In a dream or just another bar?
Wearing Navajo pearls and a turquoise ring
Hair tied up high and holes in her jeans
And I said to myself, "Oh, this is all I'll ever need"
My little ranch girl dream, yeah, ranch girl dream, yeah
