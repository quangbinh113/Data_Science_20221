Song Name: Don't It
Baby, don't say no so quick
This ain't about me trying to see how far I can get
But I ain't gonna lie wouldn't mind
Just a little bit if you and I eye to eye, lips on lips
Swayin' to the music, real close
We can both use a little let go kind of night
Baby, if you want a good time
We could get on it
Let's take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor we can dance on it, slow song it
Far as I can tell, that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights
Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got to know that I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good, don't it?
Well, I've just now seen that smile
And I bet it's a minute since you tapped on into your wild and crazy side
So baby, let's do this tonight
Baby, that moon looks just right, don't fight it
If you want a good time, we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor that we can dance on i, slow song it
Far as I can tell, that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights
Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got to know that I want it, want it
Yeah, sounds pretty good, don't it?
So baby, let's get on it
You're gonna love it, you can bet on it
Karaoke we can microphone it
Whatever you want
As far as I can see, that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights
Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got to know that I want it, want it
Yeah, sounds pretty good now, don't it?
Yeah, don't it? (Hey, hey, hey)
Get you feelin' alright girl
Yeah, sounds pretty good now, don't it?
