Song Name: Wild Palomino
A sad song sounds sadder
On an old Gibson
And it only gets better
Played a thousand times
Like an East Texas pine, can't pick up and run from its roots
Home is still home no matter which road you choose
You can't put reins on a wild palomino
And you won't see an old cowboy cry
Long as God's still in church, and hard work still works
And this collar on my shirt's still blue
I'll never stop loving you
A broke heart keeps breaking
Sitting at a bar
The whiskey's a band-aid
That just leaves more scars
Like an old Georgia pine, can't pick up and run from its roots
Home is still home no matter which road you choose
You can't put reins on a wild palomino
And you won't make a rolling stone stay
Long as God's still at church, and hard work still works
And that collar on my shirt's still blue
I'll never stop loving you
I can't change your mind, and can't change the weather
And if you need some time to run free
I made you a promise for worse or for better
Even though missing you's killing me
You can't put reins on a wild palomino
And you won't see this old cowboy cry
Long as God's still at church, and hard work still works
And that collar on my shirt's still blue
I'll never stop loving you
I'll never stop loving you
