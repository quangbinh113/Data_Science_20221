Song Name: Life Without You
Life without you would be a Tuesday at the motel
By the Denny's on the dingy side of town
Watchin' dirty water stream down a clouded window pane
While I wash your memory down
Hangin' out in places where the lonely come together
Talk about just where it all went wrong
Where all the woulda, coulda, shoulda string together like
The trappings of a sad old country song
Well, it'd be an uphill fight
Long days and lonely nights
Just a game I'm bound to lose
It'd just be somethin' I get through
A life without you
Life without you would be turnin' back to pages
That I'd written in my younger days
Livin' on the highway, always doin' it my way
All talk and nothin' to say
Floatin' through the fog in a dream of disillusion
Tryin' to fill my ever empty cup
Not knowin' good and well, when you're on the road to hell
There's worse things you can do than get stuck
It'd be an uphill fight
Long days and lonely nights
Just a game I'm bound to lose
It'd just be somethin' I get through
A life without you
Life without you would be an empty breath
A sea of loneliness
A world laid out in black and white and blue
It'd just be somethin' I get through
A life without you
