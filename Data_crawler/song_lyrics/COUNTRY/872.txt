Song Name: Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town - 1962 Version
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's makin' a list, checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good, for goodness' sake
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty-toot-toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly-haired dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
The kids in girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land town
All around the Christmas tree
Ooh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
