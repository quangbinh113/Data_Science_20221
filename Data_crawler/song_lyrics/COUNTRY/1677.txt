Song Name: Young Man
I walked back down the river bend road
Gathered up a couple good stones
Down to the water, went looking for a load
Wasn't very far from home
I saw my face at the water's edge
The man with the heavy heart
Every now and then he feels so close
But every now and then so far, tell me
Where did the young man go?
The one in the water that I used to know
When did he lose that fire?
Did he just grow old? Did he just grow tired
The face I saw was a younger man
A little more sure of his ways
Blissful fool didn't understand
Hadn't seen enough in his day
Ten years' time and a wiser mind
Seems his world has changed
Knowing somehow what I didn't know then
Would I still have done it the same? Tell me
Where did the young man go?
The one in the water that I used to know
When did he lose that fire?
Did he just grow old? Did he just grow tired?
There was a time that it came easy for a while
I know it couldn't have be that long ago
Where did the young man go?
The one in the water that I used to know
When did he lose that fire?
Did he just grow old? Did he just grow tired?
Where did the young man go?
The one in the water that I used to know
When did he lose that fire?
Did he just grow old? Did he just grow tired?
Where did the young man go?
The one in the water that I used to know
When did he lose that fire?
Did he just grow old? Did he just grow tired?
I walked back down the river bend road
Gathered up a couple good stones
Down to the water, went looking for a load
Wasn't very far from home
