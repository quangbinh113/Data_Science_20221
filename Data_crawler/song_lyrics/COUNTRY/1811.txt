Song Name: Wild Hearts
Saw the man in black
Spotlight in the air
Heard a thousand screams
Saw my daddy stare
Feel like I've been runnin'
Since the day that I was born
Eagle on my back
Phoenix on my arm
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rock stars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me, all of you lost ones?
Who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wild cards
And all of the wild hearts just like mine
Now listen
Has anyone ever told you
You'll never amount to anything
You're just wasting your time
Chasing the tail-of-a-dragon kind of dream
But I'm here to tell you
Anything can happen in this life
If you got the heart and the passion
And a God lit fire inside
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rock stars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me, all of you lost ones?
Who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wild cards
And all of the wild hearts just like mine
Just like mine
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All you born to be rock stars
And lifting your guitars and painting the sky
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rock stars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me, all of you lost ones?
Who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light (keep shining)
This goes out to the wild cards
Who's got a wild heart just like mine
