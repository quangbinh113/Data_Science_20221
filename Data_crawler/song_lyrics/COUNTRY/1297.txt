Song Name: Poor Everybody Else
Revlon on her face, like it's war paint
Black car, back seat, sippin' champagne
She's a sweet thing, trouble is her middle name
She's looking for a little tonight
She's downtown and out on a mission
Five foot three, all demolition
Hotter than a cast iron in the kitchen
Just livin' her best life
She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Man eater with an appetite
Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on skin tight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in, rockin' like a hurricane
Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else
Yeah, poor everybody else
She had her heart broke once, said, "Never again"
That's too bad for the rest of them
'Cause she's givin' 'em a dose of their own medicine
She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Man eater with an appetite
Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on skin tight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in rockin' like a hurricane
Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else, yeah
Poor everybody else
She will steal the show
Everywhere she goes
All the girls on high alert
'Cause all the guys got eyes on her
She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Man eater with an appetite
Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on tonight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in rockin' like a hurricane
Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else, yeah
Poor everybody else
Poor everybody else
Woo
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Mmm, poor everybody else
