Song Name: Love Is Real
Bare feet on a bench seat, highway and the sky
Bandana in your blue jeans, you DJ, I drive
Flippin' through the radio, and my hat you always steal
Yeah, love is real
Quick stop at a Texaco, last exit for miles
Tank top and a Topo Chico, high on your smile
Feelin' like a Polaroid the way time's standin' still
Yeah, love is real
And I could drive, your hand in mine
Oh, baby, we'll go 'til we run outta road
And the rust runs out these wheels
The way I feel, I know I always will
I am yours, you are mine, love is real
Soon as "It's Your Love" came on, I felt every word
Hearin' your pretty voice sing along changed the way I heard
The way I feel, the way I see
Honestly made me believe
That I could drive, your hand in mine
Oh, baby, we'll go 'til we run outta road
And the rust runs out these wheels
The way I feel, I know I always will
I am yours, you are mine, love is real, yeah
Love is real, baby, oh
Yeah, they can call us crazy
But that ain't gon' stop me from callin' you, baby
So come on, let's drive, your hand in mine
Oh, baby, we'll go 'til we run outta road
And the rust runs out these wheels
The way I feel, I know I always will
I am yours, you are mine, love is real
I am yours, you are mine, love is real
(Love is real, lovin' you is real)
Yeah (love is real, lovin' you is real)
I am yours (love is real, lovin' you is real)
You are mine (love is real, lovin' you is real)
Love is real (love is real, lovin' you is real)
Mhm (love is real, lovin' you)
