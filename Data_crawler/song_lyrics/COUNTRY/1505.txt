Song Name: Blue
There's something 'bout
The light right now
And the Coldplay song that's playin'
While the sun is slippin' down
It's not the drink
Goin' to my head
'Cause I know this is a moment
That I'll never forget
It's like I've never seen the ocean
Or a Bud Light neon sign
Like I've never seen a California swimmin' pool
A faded pair of Levi 505's
Thought I knew just what to call
The color of the Colorado sky
But lookin' in your eyes, it's like
Seein' blue for the first time
I'd give up red
And evergreen
'Cause right now, other colors
Don't mean anything to me
Oh, God forbid
You ever leave
I'd wear rose-colored glasses
So I'd never have to see
The colors of the ocean
Or a Bud Light neon sign
Like I've never seen a California swimmin' pool
A faded pair of Levi 505's
Thought I knew just what to call
The color of the Colorado sky
But lookin' in your eyes, it's like
Seein' blue for the first time
Some people think of heartbreak
Lookin' at the color blue
But I think of you
Yeah, I just think of you
Like I've never seen the ocean
Or a Bud Light neon sign
Like I've never seen a California swimmin' pool
A faded pair of Levi 505's
I thought I knew just what to call
The color of the Colorado sky
But lookin' in your eyes, it's like
Seein' blue for the first time
Mmm
Seein' blue for the first time
