Song Name: Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout and I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout and I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
The kings in girl and boy land
Will have have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree
So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout and I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming, Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
