Song Name: I Ain't Living Long Like This
I look for trouble and I found it son
Straight down the barrel of a law man's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
You make one move and you're a dead man friend
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
And left me reeling on a steel reel rack
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives
Son of a car-hop and some all night dives
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
You know the story how the wheel goes 'round?
Don't let them take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
I live with angel she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom in the jailhouse now
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
You know the story about the jailhouse rock?
Don't want to do it but just don't get caught
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
