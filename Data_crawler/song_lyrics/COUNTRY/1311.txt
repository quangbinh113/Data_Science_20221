Song Name: Faithfully - Acoustic
Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
I'm sending all my love
Along the wire
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am
Lost without you
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me, yeah
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ah
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Lost in awe, yeah
Faithfully, yeah
