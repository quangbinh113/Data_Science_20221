Song Name: The Love That We Need
You say I love you
I say me too
We don't think much about it
It's just a thing that we do
We go out walkin'

We don't talk much
We lie down together
But our hearts never touch
Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
We never go to bed angry
'Cause we never fight
Yeah we never go crazy
In the middle of the night
We could stay here forever
Just holdin' on
We both had our reasons
But our reasons are gone
Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
In our hearts we knew better
But we couldn't let go
Now it's time to quit hidin'
What we've always known
If somethin' was missing

We were too scared to look
Too busy tellin' our stories
Instead of writin' a book
Oh baby it's a hard way

It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
