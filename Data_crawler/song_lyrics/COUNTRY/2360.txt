Song Name: Pickinâ€™ Up Girls (feat. The Cadillac Three)
Pickin' up girls in a hand-me-down Ford
Brown bagged bottle rolling round that floor
That we fake ID'd from the corner store
Had to head on back and get a little more
'Cause we're pickin' up girls in a hand-me-down Ford
Nowhere bound, just to swig a little pour
Yeah, catch a little buzz and a kiss up against that door
Keep the party going til we get a little torn, hey, yeah
Well, it's a two-tone rust bucket
But cranks up every damn time
On a dime
Naw, it ain't much to look at
But it gets me on down the line
We'll have a real good time
Pickin' up girls in a hand-me-down Ford
It's what you do when you're small town bored
Just like my daddy and his daddy before
Damn, she likes to hear that thing roar, hey, yeah
Well, it's a two-tone rust bucket
But cranks up every damn time
On a dime
Naw, it ain't much to look at
But it gets me on down the line
We'll have a real good time
Pickin' up girls in a hand-me-down Ford
Just married in that four by four
Made a little love then we made a little more
Nine months later, County Hospital cut that chord
New bumper sticker says, "Baby on board"
Still pickin' up girls in a hand-me-down Ford, yeah
