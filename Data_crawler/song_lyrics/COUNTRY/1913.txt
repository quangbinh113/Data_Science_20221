Song Name: Actin' Up
Mirror, mirror on the saddle
Hear my rhinestones rattle, actin' up
Billy Bob Texas picking out new exes, actin' up
If you really wanna want me, I'll be riding on my pony
Just a-singing 'Mony, Mony', 'cause I'm-'m-'m-'m-'m-'m actin' up
Even Tiger Woods couldn't swing it this good, I'm actin' up
My McQueen Mustang, hundred dollars in the tank, gassin' up
I'm out in the Mojave
Call me Ricky, call me Bobby
Call me hotter than wasabi 'cause I'm actin' up
I want a sunset ride
A velvet rodeo
A Colorado high
A California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
Looking for the lightning when I find it then I rhyme it, actin' up
Little lone star Elvis gonna get a little selfish, shackin' up
With my microphone money, bought my own milk and honey
Got my own kind of country, kinda funky
Turn it up
I want a sunset ride
A velvet rodeo
A Colorado high
A California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I got a heart on fire, boy
Don't you wanna hold it?
I'm a really good trip
Don't you wanna go on it?
I want a sunset ride
A velvet rodeo
A Colorado high
A California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
