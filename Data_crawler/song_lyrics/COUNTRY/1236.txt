Song Name: Waves (Live)
Most of the time I feel alright
I'm happy in new love
Living a dream and I never think
Of the ocean between us
Most of the time your out of sight
And out of mind, I swear
Then from nowhere
Out of nowhere
It comes in waves
Crashing so hard on my heart
Think I'm gonna break
Lost in the rush of the water
I can't take the way your memory
Somehow gets control of me
It comes in waves
And it goes just like the one that got away
You had a kind of gravity
That pulled me to the edge
A desperate love, so wild 'til
I was in over my head
We both had growing up to do
And I was too afraid
What if I'd stayed?
What if I'd stayed?
It comes in waves
Crashing so hard on my heart
Think I'm gonna break
Lost in the rush of the water
I can't take the way your memory
Somehow gets control of me
It comes in waves
And it goes just like the one that got away
Out somewhere
In the blue
Is the life I didn't choose
Still as true
Are you waiting there for me
Like I'm waiting there for you
It comes in waves
Crashing
It comes in waves
Crashing so hard on my heart
Think I'm gonna break
Lost in the rush of the water
I can't take the way your memory
Somehow gets control of me
It comes in waves
And it goes just like the one that got away
And it goes just like the one that got away
And it goes just like the one that got away
And it goes just like the one that got away
And it goes just like the one that got away
