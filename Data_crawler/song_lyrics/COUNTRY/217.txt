Song Name: Eyes On You
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But I ain't got much memory of the scenes, come to think
I missed 'em all and damn babe
It's all your fault
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Don't you remember Time Square?
And people countin' down everywhere
Two thousand whatever no I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Ya you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
