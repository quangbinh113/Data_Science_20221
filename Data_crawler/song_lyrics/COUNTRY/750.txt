Song Name: Heartbeat
Mmm
I love it when we're at a party
In a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby
With the music up loud
Red wine, good times
No, I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I
I want you to myself
And tonight, I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background
Underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me
And make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?
And tonight, I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat (heartbeat)
I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beatin' faster in your chest
And tonight, I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With the River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, ohh
