Song Name: Elevator Boots - Single Edit
Bobby was a kid from 'round the town
Kicks pumped up and head held down
Underwater more than he was up
He dreamed submarines in bottle green
Imaginary flight machines
But in blue jean flares he bubbled like a 7 Up
Everybody wants to know you
When you're the only one to know
Shoot it 'til you feel alive then play one more show
Plug into the buzz and shake it 'til it turns around
And you can't stop feeling
The Paul Smith suits and the elevator boots astound
And you can't help healing
They want you and you want to
With their lips on fire and your head unscrewed
But it's time to whip another change and hit one more town
Bobby doesn't know her name
He holds on tightly just the same
Sometimes one more night is all you need
I met Alice near the Alamo
One summer in San Antonio
I remember her
I don't remember me
Everybody wants to know you
When you're the only one to know
And man, anything to feel alive and play one more show
Plug into the buzz and shake it 'til it turns around
And you can't stop feeling
The Paul Smith suits and the elevator boots astound
And you can't help healing
They want you and you want to
With their hips on fire and your head unglued
'Til it's time to whip another change and hit one more town
Alice knows the secret
And she could tell you now
If you want to
'Cause they want you
Do you want to?
I snake and sparkle, pant and glide
But it's hard to feel and I can't get high
And I don't always understand how to smile
Man, kids get sick of bein' bottled up
Drags you down 'til you throw it up
Gotta get out of the house
Take a ride on the radio dial
And everybody wants to know you
When you're the only one to know
Man, everything that feels alive is in one more show
Plug into the buzz and shake it 'til it turns around
And you can't stop feeling
The Paul Smith suits and the elevator boots astound
And you can't help healing
They want you and you want to
'Cause the kid's so clean with his soul shampoo'd
And it's time to whip another change and hit one more town
Oh yeah, it's time to whip another change and hit one more town
And man, it's time to whip another change and hit one more town
