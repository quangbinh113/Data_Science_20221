Song Name: Quite Like You
I still get chills when I see your face
Daydreams out on the interstate
It wakes my mind and their colors fade
I still get chills when I see your face
Every night I pray for you
I pray every wish you have comes true
And you dance with the stars till the morning due
Every night I pray for you
Cause I have seen the distant train
She runs from the desert to the northern plain
And every town that I've been true
I never come across another quite like you
I never come across another quite like you
Like you
And I hope you don't ever see no blues
Let 'em pour your tears and take your youth
And your heart stands strong when the storm comes through
And I hope you don't ever see no blues
Cause I have seen the distant train
She runs from the desert to the northern plain
And every town that I've been true
I never come across another quite like you
I never come across another quite like you
Like you
I still get chills when I see your face
Daydreams out on the interstate
It wakes my mind and their colors fade
I still get chills when I see your face
