Song Name: Place Out Back
Hey It ain't much to look at
No it don't cost that much
But we can hear the band from the parking lot
If you're standing on the front of my porch
There's a worm floating round tequila jar
And a dog that don't know my name
Never thought I'd live behind a country bar
I guess it's country living now all the same but
Ooh hey mama won't you take a walk with me
Ooh I got a little place out back
Don't know I got myself a place out back
Yeah I got a little place out back
Don't you know I got myself a place out back
Guitar
All my clean clothes drying on the line
So maybe we can watch a little cable tv
Old stereo only plays John Prine
You pour the drinks make a couple two three
Ooh hey mama won't you take a walk with me
Ooh I got a little place out back
Don't know I got myself a place out back
Yeah I got a little place out back
Don't you know I got myself a place out back
Alright
Ooh hey whatcha say
Ooh I got a little place out back
Don't know I got myself a place out back
Yeah I got a little place out back
Don't you know I got myself a place out
Comes with air condition if we open up the fridge
Do a little dancing on the fold down table
All rolling fast if this goes without a hitch
Queen of the castle in my airstream trailer
Ooh hey mama won't you take a walk with me
Ooh hey whatcha say
Ooh I got a little place out back
Don't know I got myself a place out back
Yeah I got a little place out back
Don't you know I got myself a place out back
Ooh I got a little place out back
Don't know I got myself a place out back
Yeah I got a little place out back
Don't you know I got myself a place out back
