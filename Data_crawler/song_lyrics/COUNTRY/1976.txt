Song Name: Get Low, Get High (Part 2) (feat. Jon Batiste & Michael Todd)
You gotta get low, so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singing la da da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine (la da da-da)
To get by
You gotta get down, so you can get up
All you really need is a little bit of love
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low, so you can get high
I woke up on the floor and the sky is pouring
I'm getting tired of feeling like this every morning
I looked into the mirror and I can't ignore it
I'm feeling the weight, hey-hey
There ain't no brushing off the world on your shoulder
I figured out that you go under to get over
So if you're someone out there looking for some closure
Well, I gotta say
You gotta get low, so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singing la da da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine (la da da-da)
To get by
You gotta get down, so you can get up
All you really need is a little bit of love
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low, so you can get high
Get high
Get high
Get high
Okay, I'm talking to my fellas, uh
(Get low) yeah
And now my ladies, yeah
(Get high)
Okay, I'm talking to my fellas, yeah
(Get low)
And now my ladies, yeah
(Get high)
Okay, now let me hear the ladies, yeah
(Get low)
And then I holla at my fellas, yeah
(Get high)
Now let me hear the ladies, yeah
(Get low)
Everybody, ooh
You gotta get low, so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singing la da da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine (la da da-da)
To get by
You gotta get down, so you can get up (get up)
All you really need is a little bit of love (little bit of love)
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low, so you can get high
Get high get (get, get-get-get), get high, yeah (get, get-get-get)
When you get low, when you get low
You gotta get high
