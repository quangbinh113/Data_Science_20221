Song Name: Little Toy Trains - From The Vault
Little toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
Close your eyes
Listen to the sky
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Chris Cringle and the jingle bell
Bringing little toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
Close your eyes
Listen to the sky
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Chris Cringle and the jingle bell
Bringing little toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
