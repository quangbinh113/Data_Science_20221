Song Name: Stay Tuned
Would it be nice
To find yourself a feeling
Would it be wrong
To find it all in a song
These are all of the things
I so painfully want to believe
Tell me I'm naïve
Tell me I'm so damn wrong
With these dumbass dreams
Writing songs to sing
To people who won't sing along
I gotta go now baby
And I don't want to be rude
I got too much going for me now
Honey stay tuned
Would it be wrong
If I told you that I love this shit
I just can't get enough of it everyday
What would you say
If I said that you're the stupid one
You can't undo what's left undone anyways
You can say
Tell me I'm naïve
Tell me I'm so damn wrong
With these dumbass dreams
Writing songs to sing
To people who won't sing along
I gotta go now baby
And I don't want to be rude
I got too much going for me now
Honey stay tuned
So when I'm doing it big
Honey please don't tell me shit
Like I'm naïve
Or tell me I'm so damn wrong
With these dumbass dreams
Writing songs to sing
To people who won't sing along
I gotta go now baby
And I don't want to be rude
I got too much going for me now
Honey stay tuned
Yeah, well honey stay tuned
Honey stay tuned
