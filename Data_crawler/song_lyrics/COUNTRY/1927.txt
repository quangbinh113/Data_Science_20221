Song Name: The Ocean (feat. Charlie Worsham)
I was in love once with a boy from California
And it didn't last
Yeah, I never could've known that
And there was the first time
That I ever said, "I love you"
To some brown eyes on the East coast
'Til the words ran out of truth
Hmm, that's how it goes sometimes
Just like water rolls in wilds
Some loves are easy, coming and going
Some loves are endless, feel just like home and
Some loves are dead ends, some flow into the great wide open
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
And all of the stones that hit me at rock bottom
And all the shallow waters
That couldn't carry my heart through
They might've hurt, yeah
But they all had one thing in common
Despite all of their problems, they led me to you
Some loves are easy, coming and going
Some loves are endless, feel just like home and
Some loves are dead ends, some flow into the great wide open
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
Hmm, turns out you were here the whole time
Just had to follow that tide
Some loves are easy, coming and going
Some loves are endless, feel just like home and
Some loves are dead ends, some flow into the great wide open, hmm
Some loves are easy, coming and going
Some loves are endless, feel just like home and
Some loves are dead ends, some flow into the great wide open
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
Some loves are rivers, some are the ocean
Hmm, some are the ocean
Some loves are rivers, you are the ocean
