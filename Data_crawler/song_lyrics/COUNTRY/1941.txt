Song Name: Let the Rain Come Down
We all need rain, Lord, the sun sure stinks
Somebody string a rattlesnake up
Good Lord, my whole world ran dry the day
That wicked ol' witch said, "Bye"
She put a curse on me
One on the river
Now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart
A pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest, and my eyes won't pour
Let the rain come down
I should've been long gone, cold turkey
Now I'm sitting on the front porch, stoned
Looking back now, the past was murky
It ain't no wonder why my money's all gone
She put a curse on me
One on the river
Now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart
A pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest, and my eyes won't pour
Let the rain come down
Yeah, let the rain come down
Oh, let it rain
Look yonder to the west, I can feel it in my bones
Here comes a hard rain, just a-blackin' out the sky
I'd run for shelter if I wasn't me
Better pay heed to the past or wind up dry
She put a curse on me
One on the river
Now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart
A pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest, and my eyes won't pour
She put a curse on me
One on the river
Now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart
A pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest, and my eyes won't pour
Let the rain come down
Yeah, let the rain come down
