Song Name: Fall
Well,Baby,I Know I got my Bad Habits.
And Girl I know You're as perfect as Candy.
But The Way Youre Swaying In The Moonlight,
Girl Its Got Me Feeling So Right
So Just
Fall With Me
Yeah You Might Not Know Where This One Might Ever Lead
Yeah Baby, Fall With Me
Forget About Life And All This Madness,
Forget About Loving All This Sadness.
Just Fall.
Yeah, Fall.
Baby I Know I Ain't Good For You,
But I'm Ready Enough So Lets Just See.
Just A Slow Dance In These Barlights,
Yeah It's Got Me Thanking You Like:
You Were Mine.
Fall With Me.
Yeah You Never Know Where This One Might Ever Lead.
Yeah Baby,
Fall With Me.
Forget About Life And All This Madness,
Forget About Lovin' All This Sadness,
And Fall.
Yeah,Fall.
Fall With Me.
Yeah You Might Never Know Where This One Leads!
Fall With Me.
Forget About Life And All This Madness,
Forget About Loving All This Sadness.
Fall.
Yeah,Fall.
Yeah,You Never Know,
You Never Know,
You Never Know,
You Never Know With This Many,Just Slowly Fall With Me.
