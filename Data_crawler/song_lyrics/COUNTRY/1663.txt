Song Name: Hummingbird
Rose to rose, you drink it all in
As fast as you can, dying to win
God only knows what you're looking for

Search high and low, let me help you find it
Hummingbird, don't fly so far away
I think the answers you seek are right underneath your wings
If you'd only slow down enough
To breath my girl, let go of the ways of this world
I got the love that you need, Yeah I've got the love you need
Ooh oh oh hummingbird
Baby take a minute take a little while, and look around
Every now and then just let your feet touch the ground
God only knows where you're flying to

But you're not alone, babe I'm right behind you
Hummingbird, don't fly so far away
I think the answers you seek are right underneath your wings
If you'd only slow down enough
To breath my girl, let go of the ways of this world
I got the love that you need, yeah I've got the love you need
