Song Name: Dark Night - 717 Tapes
Headlights burnin' up the highway
Cigarette hangin' off my lip
Mama, I ain't seen the light of day
Since I met some habits I can't kick
It's a dark night
I don't know if I'll make it out on my own
Sunrise to sunrise
Everything's a blur behind the whiskey and smoke
Devil's on my shoulder, demon's gettin' closer
All I know is I gotta ride
Ride into that dark night
Ride into that dark night
Red and blue shinin' off the rearview
Honey, you were my halo
Swear to God, I hear you
Sayin', "Please just come on home"
It's a dark night
I don't know if I'll make it out on my own
Sunrise to sunrise
Everything's a blur bеhind the whiskey and smoke
Dеvil's on my shoulder, demon's gettin' closer
All I know is I gotta ride
Ride into that dark night
Ride into that dark night
Red and blue shinin' off the rearview
I'm an outlaw without you
Ride into that dark night
I don't know if I'll make it out on my own
Sunrise to sunrise
Everything's a blur behind the whiskey and smoke
Devil's on my shoulder, demon's gettin' closer
All I know is I gotta ride
Ride into that dark night
Ride into that dark night
