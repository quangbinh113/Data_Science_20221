Song Name: Hold My Halo
Been working like a dog, tryna please 'em all
Tryna put another comma in the bank
Tryna get these broke-down dreams to crank
Sometimes a good, good girl's gotta break out the denim
Gonna pour me a drink, pour my ass in 'em
For heaven's sake, I need a good time
Lord knows it ain't no crime
To leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo
I don't need no help, no, I got this
Coming in hot as hell, y'all watch this
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado
Light it up, let it all go
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low
Hold my halo
I got a neon side
I let her shine sometimes
Sitting like a devil on my shoulder
Tonight I'm gonna let her take over
And leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo
I don't need no help, no, I got this
Coming in hot as hell, y'all watch this
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado
Light it up, let it all go
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low
Hold my halo
Put it back on in the morning
P-put it back on in the morning
P-put it back on in the morning
P-put it back on, put it back
Sometimes a good good girl's gotta break out the denim
Gonna pour me a drink, pour my ass in 'em
For heaven's sake, I need a good time
Lord knows it ain't no crime
To leave a little lipstick red on a solo
Make a little mess of my head on the Cuervo
I don't need no help, no, I got this
Coming in hot as hell, y'all watch this
Gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado
Light it up, let it all go
Tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low
Hold my halo
Hold my halo
P-put it back on, put it back on
P-put it back on in the morning
P-put it back on, put it back on
P-put it back on in the morning
Hold my halo
