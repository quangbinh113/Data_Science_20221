Song Name: Till There's Nothing Left
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
I wanna steal every breath of fire (la, la, la, la, la)
From every star in the Southern sky (la, la, la, la, la)
I wanna lay down in the dark (la, la, la, la, la)
And take a match right to your heart (la, la, la, la, la)
I wanna hide with you in the rain (la, la, la, la, la)
In the eye of a hurricane (la, la, la, la, la)
I wanna call it for what it is (la, la, la, la, la)
And give you everything I've got to give
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
Me and you in the backseat
Drivin' me crazy
Killin' me baby
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
With the windows up
Spendin' all my love
Prayin' God don't save me
'Til there's nothing left
Keep me locked up in your eyes (la, la, la, la, la)
Before the sun pushes out the night (la, la, la, la, la)
Before we're whispers in the air (la, la, la, la, la)
Come on and take me without a care (la, la, la, la, la)
I wanna know what it feels like
To disappear into you and
Never have to say goodbye
I wanna call love what it is
And give you everything I've got to give
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
Me and you in the backseat
Drivin' me crazy
Killin' me baby
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
With the windows up
Spendin' all my love
Prayin' God don't save me
Don't wanna go yet, Romeo and Juliet
Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset
Ooh baby, drivin' me crazy
Windows up, prayin' God don't save me
Don't wanna go yet, Romeo and Juliet
Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset
Ooh baby, drivin' me crazy
Windows up, prayin' God don't save me
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
Me and you in the backseat
Drivin' me crazy
Killin' me baby
'Til there's nothing left
'Til there's nothing left
With the windows up
Spendin' all my love
Prayin' God don't save me
'Til there's nothing left
