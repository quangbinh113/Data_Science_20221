Song Name: Christmas Comin' Round Again
Two brothers not speaking for two years now
Can't even remember what they're fighting about
It might be the snowfall or the globe of those lives
But they both say "I'm sorry" end up talking all night
Hallelujah!
There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah!
It's time to let go and let the love in
Christmas is comin' 'round again
There's a mom and a daddy who split up last July
Two houses, three kids, now they're splitting up at time
Comes over for dinner
Ends up sticking around
Around the table they're laughing
Hey, they might work it out
Hallelujah!
There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah!
It's time to let go and let the love in
Christmas is comin' 'round again
Oh, there's something 'bout this time of year
And makes you wanna start living right now, right here
He opens the door and walks inside
The choir is singing 'Silent Night'
And then in his place since he turned 18
Heard the story of a baby born the king
Sent here to save us from everything
He hit him straight in his heart and
He fell to his knees
Hallelujah!
There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah!
It's time to let go and let the love in
Hallelujah!
There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah!
It's time to let go and let the love in
Christmas is comin' 'round again
Christmas is comin' 'round again
