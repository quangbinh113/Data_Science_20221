Song Name: Take Me Back To Tulsa
Where's that girl with the red dress on? Some folks calls her Dinah;
Stole my heart away from me, way down in Louisana.
Take Me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry;
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry.
Little bee sucks the blossom, big bee gets the honey,
Dark man picks the cotton, White man gets the money.
Oh, walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
Walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
I went to the Railroad, laid my head down on the track.
I thought about that girl of mine and I gradually eased it back.
We always wear a great big smile, we never do look sour.
Travel all over the country, playing music by the hour.
Where's that girl with the red dress on? Some folks calls her Dinah;

Take Me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry;
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry.
Little bee sucks the blossom, big bee gets the honey,
Dark man picks the cotton, White man gets the money.
Oh, walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
Walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
I went to the Railroad, laid my head down on the track.
I thought about that girl of mine and I gradually eased it back.
We always wear a great big smile, we never do look sour.
Travel all over the country, playing music by the hour.
