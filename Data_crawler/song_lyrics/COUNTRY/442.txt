Song Name: Some Beach
Drivin' down the interstate
Runnin' 30 minutes late
Singin' 'Margaritaville' and mindin' my own
Some foreign car drivin' dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talkin' on his cell phone
He started yellin' at me
Like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird
And then he was gone
Some beach somewhere
There's a big umbrella
Casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growin', and warm breeze is blowin'
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
I circled the parkin' lot
Tryin' to find a spot
Just big enough
I could park my ol' truck
A man with a big cigar
Was gettin' into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruisin' up, and whipped right in
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go
When you've got all day to get there
There's cold Margaritas
And hot senoritas
Smilin' with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere
Well, I sat in that waitin' room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said the doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novocaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drillin' before I was numb
Some beach, somewhere
There a beautiful sunset burnin' up the atmosphere
There's music and dancin' and lovers romancin'
In the salty evenin' air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere
