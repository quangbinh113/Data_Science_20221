Song Name: I'm From The Country - Single Version
Way back up in the country, back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Living with the crazies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coon skin caps
That's where I'm from and I'm proud to say
I'm from the country and I like it that way
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Oh, kick off your shoes, come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way
All day long we work in the fields
And bring it on home to a home cooked meal
We love you like Sunday and treat you like Saturday night
And when the beds get full we can sleep in the hay (hey)
We're from the country and we like it that way
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Oh, kick off your shoes, come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Oh, kick off your shoes, come on in (come on in)
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country, we're from the country
We're from the country and we like it that way
