Song Name: Time Marches On
Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in, feathers on his head
Mama's in her room learnin' how to sew
Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio
Hank Williams sings "Kaw Liga" and "Dear John"
And time marches on, time marches on
Sisters usin' rouge and clear complexion soap
Brothers wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings "Like A Rolling Stone"
And time marches on, time marches on
The south moves north, the north moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same
Is everything changes, everything changes
Sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brothers on a diet for high cholesterol
Mama's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath a maple tree
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
