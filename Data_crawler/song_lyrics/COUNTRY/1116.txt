Song Name: Diamond Studded Shoes
Everybody's saying
That it's gonna be alright
But i can't help but wonder
If it's gonna be on my dime
We are the powers
Throwing up against the tide
Burning our reserves of courage
And working just to make it alright
When we know it isn't
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, that's why we got to fight
You and i are trying
But we don't get to decide
When the man comes for our paychecks
Don't you tell me it'll be alright
We aren't the rich ones
Some of us will barely get by
They buy diamond studded shoes with our taxes
Anything to keep us divided
You know it isn't
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, that's why we got to fight
For the life and soul of the world we know
Fight, cause the promise is never gonna be enough
Watching and waiting for answers
Hoping we might see the light
You beat it into us like a hammer
So don't you tell me it'll be alright
When we know it isn't
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, and that's why we got to fight
For the life and soul of the world we know
Fight, cause the promise is never gonna be enough
Oh yeah (we know it isn't, we know it isn't)
Oh yeah (we know it isn't)
You know (we know it isn't, we know it isn't)
You know (we know it isn't)
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't
