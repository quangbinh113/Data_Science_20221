Song Name: Them Boots
Oh, I grew up in the country
Church every Sunday, fishing after that
I'm talking work on Monday
Blue collar money's all that we had
Always repent, admit your sins and never forget
Where you come from, son
I was raised in a trailer on 25 acres 'til I was 16
Then I spread my wings on a baseball dream
'Til I hurt my knee
Hung up the glory to tell my stories
On this old six string
I'm just a whiskey drinking, good Lord praising
Hell raising, Waylon cranking redneck, that's my roots
I'm talking back road riding, grew up fighting, ain't denying, yes sir
I'm a south side of the red, white, and blue
I ain't just rocking them boots
Yeah, we picked our switches
Dug our ditches, made our own beds
Yeah, we opened doors and did our chores without it being said
Don't you start no fights, son
Naw, unless you know how to finish one
I'm just a whiskey drinking, good Lord praising
Hell raising, Waylon cranking redneck, that's my roots
I'm talking back road riding, grew up fighting, ain't denying, yes sir
I'm a south side of the red, white, and blue
I ain't just rocking them boots
I'm talking front porch sitting, guitar picking, family all around
Moonshine flowing, poor folks growing green from the ground
Pay their bills, judge if you will
Where I come from
I'm just a whiskey drinking, good Lord praising
Hell raising, Waylon cranking redneck, that's my roots
I'm talking back road riding, grew up fighting, ain't denying, yes sir
I'm a south side of the red, white, and blue
I ain't just rocking them boots
I ain't just rocking them boots
I ain't just rocking them boots
