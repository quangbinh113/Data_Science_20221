Song Name: Catch
I wasn't tryna feel like this
I wasn't tryna feel nothin' at all
I just came to meet my friends
And try to drink a long week off
I didn't want to stay too late
I wasn't tryna close it down
I was doin' my own thing
Yeah up 'til you sat down
I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smiling I can't help myself
Girl you got me tryna catch my breath
You got me tryna catch my breath yeah
You got me doin' double takes
You went and messed up all my plans
I only meant to hold this drink
Now I'm tryna hold your hand
Yeah I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smiling I can't help myself
Girl you got me tryna catch my breath whoa
Oh you got me tryna catch my breath whoa
Got me catching feelings
I wasn't even tryna feel this
I don't know how you started stealing
My heart like you are
In this bar
But I'm glad that you are
Cause I just thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smiling I can't help myself
Girl you got me tryna catch my breath ohhh
You got me tryna catch my breath yeah
Oh you got me tryna catch my breath oh
You got me tryna catch my breath whoa
