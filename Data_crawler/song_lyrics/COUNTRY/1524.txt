Song Name: Cigarettes and Alcohol
Cigarettes and alcohol
Well I'll take those to my grave
But I've added adderall
Columbian cocaine
So long well here I go
Well I'd do just anything
To make my mind up dear
Well I'm going insane
So stab me in the back
Cause I kinda like the pain
Find your reasons to go
And not your reasons to stay
And I hoped you'd find yourself
Cause I can't do everything
And now you did
And I can't do anything
Well I hope your proud of me
Cause I made some friends today
And as I fade to grey
Well I'm still your enemy
Well I tried to find some help
But they're never here for me
So I'll find some new friends in the shape
Of ounces and grams
And one day I'll see the light
Through these dark days I'm sure
But right now I'm feeling good
And I'm numb to my core
So stab me in the back
Cause I kinda like the pain
Find your reasons to go
And not your reasons to stay
And I hoped you'd find yourself
Cause I can't do everything
And now you did
And I can't do anything
Well I hope your proud of me
Cause I made some friends today
And as I fade to grey
Well I'm still your enemy
My bad darling I'm sorry
But life just ain't fair
And I can't be someone I'm not
And you can't hang from what's not there
We had a good run but
It just ain't in the cards
So don't run my name in the dirt
Don't go and take it so hard
So stab me in the back
Cause I kinda like the way
You found your reasons to go
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
And I hoped you'd find yourself
Cause I can't do everything
And now you did
And I can't do anything
Well I hope your proud of me
Cause I made a choice today
And as we go our way
Well there's nothing left to say
