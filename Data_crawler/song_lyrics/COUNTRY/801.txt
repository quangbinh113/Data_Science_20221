Song Name: Hell Of A View
I was no daddy's dream
Was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket outta there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my Bronco tires
Outta that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standing still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We're livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shooting stars
Chasing what's in our hearts
Into the blue (into the blue)
This ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view
Hell of a view
We ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view

Hell of a view
Hell of a view
Hell of a view
