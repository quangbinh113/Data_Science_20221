Song Name: Honky Tonk in Heaven
Well, I live my life somewhere between Jack and Jesus
Between Folsom Prison Blues and I saw the light
And I know I won't steam the butter now I'm a believer
But nobody here showed this crazy world alive
So I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
Then, if there's a bar, I hope that they stocked it well
Yeah, I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
'Cause when I get there I'm gonna raise a little hell
When that whistle blows
I know where I'm heading
To where those neon angels know my name
Yeah, if I die tonight, yeah, I know I'm forgiven
My heart saying Peter, but if it's all the same
I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
Then, if there's a bar, I hope that they stocked it well
Yeah, I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
'Cause when I get there I'm gonna raise a little hell
Raise some hell y'all
I'm gonna walk right up to old Wailin
Maybe buy him a drink, maybe bump a line
Well, I know dang well even Jesus had a good time
He's the one that turned that water into wine
I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
Then, if there's a bar, I hope that they stocked it well
Yeah, I hope that there's a honky tonk in heaven
'Cause when I get there I'm gonna raise a little hell, hell yeah
Oh, when I get there I'm gonna raise a little hell
Alright
Let's raise some hell boys
Come on, hey!
