Song Name: Road Less Traveled
Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (Mmm, mm)
Dress sizes can't define
Don't let the world decide what's beautiful
No
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just flaunt it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Don't follow anyone
March to the rhythm of a different drum
Why do we analyze
Break down, and criticize the crazy ones?
Oh-oh-oh
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just flaunt it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Put your hands up
Show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up
Let me hear your voice tonight
Oh
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on
