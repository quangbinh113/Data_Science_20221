Song Name: Lost In The Fifties Tonight
Close your eyes, Baby
Follow my heart
Call on the memories
Here in the dark
We'll let the magic
Take us away
Back to the feelings
We shared when they played
In the still of the night
Hold me darlin', hold me tight
So real, so right
I'm lost in the fifties tonight
These precious hours
We know can't survive
But loves all that matters
While the past is alive
Now and for always
Till time disappears
We'll hold each other
Whenever we hear
In the still of the night
Hold me darlin', hold me tight
So real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight
(One more time it here)
So right
So real, so right
So real, so right
I'm lost in the fifties tonight
