Song Name: Don't Let Me Cross Over
Don't let me cross over love's cheatin' line
I'm tempted my darlin', to steal you away
So help me my darlin', stay out of my way
You know that I love you, but I'm not the cheatin' kind
I'm faced with a heartache at love's cheatin' line
Don't let me cross over love's cheatin' line
You belong to another and you'd never be mine
I know one step closer, would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over, love's cheatin' line
I've tried to forget you, but what else can I do
When your eyes keep sayin', that you love me too
I know if I lose you, not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear, but I can't help myself
Don't let me cross over love's cheatin' line
You belong to another and you'd never be mine
I know one step closer, would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over, love's cheatin' line
