Song Name: Come Back Down
Tell me darlin', how's your mom been?
How's the weather where you are?
'Cause me, I've been better
Still chasing dreams
Still shootin' at stars
Tell me, have you found a new man?
Tell me, have you moved on?
'Cause me, I'm getting tired
And this road, it's gettin' hard
And it's, street signs and people, prescription pills and too much booze
All the things I use, tryna forget about you
And I still see your face, in every single crowd
'Cause you're never there to catch me
When I come back down
And it's a fucked up situation I put us in
When the woman I left you for left me for another man
And I guess I should apologize
But I never could lay down my pride
'Cause it's, street signs and people, prescription pills and too much booze
All the things I used, tryna forget about you
And I still see your face, in every single crowd
'Cause you're never there to catch me
When I come back down
And it's, street signs and people, prescription pills and too much booze
All the things I used, tryna forget about you
And I still see your face, in every single crowd
'Cause you're never there to catch me
No, you're never there to catch me
No, you're never there to catch me
When I come back
Tell me darlin', how's your mom been?
How's the weather where you are?
'Cause me, I've been better
Still chasin' dreams
Still shootin' at stars
