Song Name: Have Mercy
I was standing in line at the city bus stop
Soaked to the skin from heavy rain drop
I see you driving by just like a Phantom Jet
With your arm around some little Brunette
You say you won't be home because you're working late
Honey, I'm no fool, you've been out on a date
The lipstick on your collar gives your game away
It's strawberry red and mine's pink rose
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Well, I called you up on the telephone
I could hear you was playin' 'Haggard and Jones'
I knew right then that there was something wrong
There's only one reason you play cheatin' songs
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me, yeah!
Aaww!
Well, I went up to the bank with my little check book
The cashier, he gave me the strangest look
He said you ain't got no money 'cause you're over drawn
Your man took it all and he's a done gone
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Aaww!
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, honey, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Aaww!
