Song Name: Love Without End, Amen
I got sent home from school one day
With a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When Dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees
And waited for the worst
He said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
He said, "Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy
Was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience
Had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
I said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
I said, "Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen"
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done
They'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard those words again
They said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see, daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen"
