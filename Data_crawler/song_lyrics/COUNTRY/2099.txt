Song Name: I'll Get Over You - Remastered
One thing 'bout this heart of mine
All my hurts gonna mend in time
It don't leave no scars behind
I'll get over you
I'll find me a guy one day
Who's not scared to give his heart away
When I do, it's safe to say
That I'll get over you
()
I'll get over you
I'll get through, and when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
From now on, I think I'll lay low
I'll talk fast but I'll move slow
You taught me all I need to know
'Bout gettin' over you
Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
But I know it's just until
I get over you
(Repeat)
Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
Love for you's so hard to kill
But I'll get over you
(Repeat until fade)
