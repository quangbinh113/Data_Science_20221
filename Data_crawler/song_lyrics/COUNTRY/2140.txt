Song Name: Know That by Now
I can't have one drink without having four
Bum one cigarette and I'm headed to the store
Better at gettin' lost than bein' found
You think I'd know that by now
When I hear that song, it never ends well
If I let it play on, I'll find myself
With the wheels fallin' off, when I drive by your house
You think I'd know that by now
I've been around the sun a time or two
Runnin' in circles ain't nothing new
I never moved on, I just like the way it sounds
You think I'd know that by now
I say give it some time, I bet that's the cure
I'll find someone else, but one thing's for sure
I don't know what I'm talkin' about
You think I'd know that by now
I've been around the sun, a time or two
Runnin' in circles ain't nothing new
I never moved on, I just like the way it sounds
You think I'd know that by now
I dream you're comin' back but you're not
I still sleep with my door unlocked
I've been around the sun, a time or two
Runnin' in circles ain't nothing new
I never moved on, I just like the way it sounds
You think I'd know that by now
You think I'd know that by now
You think I'd know that by now
By now
