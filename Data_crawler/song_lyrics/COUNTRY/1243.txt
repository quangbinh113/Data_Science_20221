Song Name: Growing Old With You - First Dance Version
Girl, you stole my heart and changed it
Took all of my plans and rearranged them
Now I finally know what amazing grace is
When I look into your eyes
Baby, I see my whole life
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on a hill
Travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well, come on baby, what you say we do?
I feel like growing old with you

I'm growing old with you
Every day I'll love you better than the day before
Watching sunsets fading from the front porch
We'll build this home together, weather any storm
And as the years keep rolling on
You'll be right where I belong
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on a hill
Travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well, come on baby, what you say we do?
I feel like growing old with you
I'm growing old with you
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on a hill
Travel 'round this world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Maybe one day our babies go
And have some babies of their own
And you'll get all my time 'til all my time is through
I feel like growing old with you

Growing old with you
I feel like growing old with you
