Song Name: Coulda Loved You Longer
We were both downtown
Different sides of the same crowd
Wasn't even gonna go out
Stay there, maybe
You wrote your number on a napkin
Without me even asking
Still feels like it happened
Just yesterday
And I know we got forever, babe
So I got no reason to complain
There's nothin' about us that I'd change
Except one thing
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had spent it on you
Instead of wastin' all that time
All of our favorite memories
Will go back a little bit further
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you, I could've loved you longer
All of those sunsets, I bet they would've looked better
Shining in your eyes, with your hand in mine
And all of those lonely nights, they could've been together
Could've felt like this everytime we kiss
Can't help it out
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had spent it on you
Instead of wastin' all that time
All of our favorite memories
Will go back a little bit further
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you, I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had met you, wish I'd had met you
Wish I'd had met you sooner
I could've loved you, I could've loved you
I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had met you, wish I'd had met you
Wish I'd had met you sooner
I could've loved you, I could've loved you
I could've loved you longer
And I know we got forever, babe
So I got no reason to complain
There's nothin' about us that I'd change
Except one thing
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had spent it on you
Instead of wastin' all that time
All of our favorite memories
Will go back a little bit further
Wish I'd had met you sooner
So I could've loved you, I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had met you, wish I'd had met you
Wish I'd had met you sooner (maybe I could've loved you)
I could've loved you, I could've loved you (longer)
I could've loved you longer
Wish I'd had met you, wish I'd had met you
Wish I'd had met you sooner
I could've loved you, I could've loved you
I could've loved you longer
