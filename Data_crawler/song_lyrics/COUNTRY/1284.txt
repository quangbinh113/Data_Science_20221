Song Name: Wild as Her (feat. Carter Faith) - Acoustic One-Take
She never wanted to be white picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
A sea salt breeze will bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is free right next to me
'Cause I ain't trying to tame her love
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hanging on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't living for a diamond ring
Just living like the rock'n'roll song she sings out loud
We're burning it down
Blazing up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
That's where she calls home
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hanging on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild, wild, yeah
Ye-ye-yeah
I ain't tryna fix her
I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
We don't say forever, but when we're together
I swear no, we ain't ever letting go
'Cause she knows
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hanging on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah
