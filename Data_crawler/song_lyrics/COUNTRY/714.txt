Song Name: Singles You Up
I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm oversteppin' boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'm gonna be the first one callin' you baby (baby)
If he ain't holdin' you tight, if he ain't treatin' you right
I'm gonna be the first one callin' him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's starin' you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singin' along
And he don't even know a single word
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'm gonna be the first one callin' you baby (baby)
If he ain't holdin' you tight, if he ain't treatin' you right
I'm gonna be the first one callin' him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's starin' you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'm gonna be the first to call baby
Sorry if I'm oversteppin' boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'm a be the first one callin' you baby (baby)
If he ain't holdin' you tight, if he ain't treatin' you right
I'm gonna be the first one callin' him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's starin' you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
