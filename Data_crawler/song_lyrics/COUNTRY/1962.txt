Song Name: Hey Cowboy
Ripped jeans hanging by the back door
James Dean, I know what you came for
Meet me underneath the chandelier (hi)
Hey you, looking like a wild one
Nice boots, think I got the same ones
You're cute, maybe we could split some beers
Hey, cowboy
With that look in your eyes
Need a lipstick stain on your whiskey ice
Hey, cowboy
Whatcha doing tonight?
Know a place downtown with a vacant sign
Giddy up, cowboy, if you're down to ride
You can keep your boots on if you like
You can keep your boots on, baby
I'm a woman, not a lady
Burt's bees, coconut chopstick
Wet tee contest on the back deck
Got me howling at the full moon (ah-woo)
Love the way you look at me
Blow me like a tumbleweed
Hold me down and wrangle me
Tie me up and set me free
Hey, cowboy
With that look in your eyes
Need a lipstick stain on your whiskey ice
Hey, cowboy
Whatcha doing tonight?
Know a place downtown with a vacant sign
Giddy up, cowboy, if you're down to ride
You can keep your boots on if you like
You can keep your boots on, baby
I'm a woman, not a lady
You can keep your boots on, baby
I'm a woman, not a lady
You can take me into your arms
When the dawn breaks, I'll be long gone
Riding off into the sunrise
You were just a good time, boy (hey, cowboy)
You can take me (you can take me), into your arms (into your arms)
When the dawn breaks, I'll be long gone (hey, cowboy)
Riding off into the sunrise
You were never my guy
Hey, cowboy
With that look in your eyes
Need a lipstick stain on your whiskey ice (on your whiskey ice)
Hey, cowboy
Whatcha doing tonight?
Know a place downtown with a vacant sign (with a vacant sign)
Giddy up, cowboy, if you're down to ride (if you're down to ride)
You can keep your boots on if you like
Da-da-da-da-da-da
You can keep your boots on baby (you can keep your boots on, baby)
I'm a woman, not a lady
Whatcha doing tonight? Whatcha doing tonight?
You can keep your boots on, baby (keep your boots on, baby)
I'm a woman, not a lady
