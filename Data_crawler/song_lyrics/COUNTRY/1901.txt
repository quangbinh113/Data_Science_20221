Song Name: Independent With You
I tend to build walls
Yeah, I can act tough
I'm strong when I wanna be
That's all the time for me
I've had my heart broke
My ego's been bruised
I don't give it away no more
That's what breakups are for
I don't ask for help, I like to do things by myself
Can I stand on my own two feet while you hold my hand?
Can I be my own woman with you as my man?
Can I let you in without changing who I am?
Do I have to choose?
Can I still be independent with you? (you, you)
Can I still be independent with you?
The way you look at me
I'm starting to believe
That I could call you mine
And you'd still let me shine
'Cause I would do the same for you, we could be living proof
Can I stand on my own two feet while you hold my hand?
Can I be my own woman with you as my man?
Can I let you in without changing who I am?
Do I have to choose?
Can I still be independent with you? (you, you)
Can I still be independent with you?
The way you're holding me
Is never too tight
I can finally breathe for the first time
The way you're holding me
Is never too tight
I can finally breathe for the first time
I can stand on my own two feet while you hold my hand
I can be my own woman with you as my man
And I can let you in without changing who I am
I don't have to choose
No, I can be independent with you
Yeah, I'm still independent with you
Oh, you, you
I can be independent with you
