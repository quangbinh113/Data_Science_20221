Song Name: The Letter That Johnny Walker Read (feat. Lee Ann Womack)
Johnny Walker sat at a table in a bar
Minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake over the rocks
He was drunk, too drunk to care
When a girl from the bar walked up beside him
And this is what she said
She said, a woman came by with a letter for you
And this is what the letter said
Dear John, please, Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
Then John, he got up from the table
Slowly, he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
And how his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off into that street light
And a vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him lying drunk there in that gutter
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read
And this is what it said
Dear John, please, Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
Dear John, please, Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
