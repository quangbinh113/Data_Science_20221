Song Name: One Of Them Girls
Are you one of them girls?
That peels off the Bud-Light label
Just might run a pool table
Roll your eyes if I call you an angel
Ain't you, one of them girls?
Ask you to dance, you say, "No"
Just to see how far I'll go
Your song comes on and your eyes closed
That's when I know, yeah
You got your heart on lockdown
Got a wall I gotta knock down
Kinda wanna do a shot now, come on now
And you're one of them girls that
Ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party
If I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that
Ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you
You like to make us wonder
If you're one of them girls
'Cause I'm one of them boys
Who'll trade his whole world, hmm, yeah
For one of them girls
Who likes to act all quiet
Sexy, not even tryin'
Yeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right
You one of them girls
Broke every heart in your hometown
On the day you rode out
Got 'em all wishin' on stars now
If I find one of them girls that
Ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party
If I'm wrong them stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that
Ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you
You like to make us wonder
If you're one of them girls
Well I'm one of them boys
Who'll trade his whole world, yeah
For one of them girls
You're one of them girls
I wanna put my lips on
Hold all night long
Write a little love song
For one of them girls that
Ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party
If I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that
Ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you
You like to make us wonder
If you're one of them girls
Well I'm one of them boys
Who'll trade his whole world (his whole world)
For one of them girls
Hmm, one of them girls
