Song Name: There's Always Next Year
Well that truck in the front yard
Needs a new carburetor
And that hole in the sheetrock
I'll get to it later
This front porch swingers got a six-pack stringer
So l'll probably won't do it today
But there's always next year to drink less beer
And think less about your memory
Get your picture off the dashboard of this ol' Ford
And start workin' on a brand new me
I know I need to quite drinkin', and smokin', and move on
Instead of wishin' and hopin' you'd come back around here
There's always next year, aww yeah
That church where I oughta go
Will still be there
And this break in my heart, no, it ain't goin' nowhere
But there's always next year to drink less beer
And think less about your memory
Get your picture off the dashboard of this ol' Ford
And start workin' on a brand new me
I know I need to quite drinkin', and smokin', and move on
Instead of wishin' and hopin' you'd come back around here
But there's always next year
The fish ain't bitin', the cows ain't mooin'
The crops ain't growin' at all
And I can't sleep without you next to me
Or stop singin' about you being gone
But there's always next year to drink less beer
And think less about your memory
Get your picture off the dashboard of this ol' Ford
And start workin' on a brand new me
I know I need to quite drinkin', and smokin', and move on
Instead of wishin' and hopin' you'd come back around here
But there's always next year
There's always next year
There's always next year
