Song Name: I Know
I caught the corner of your silhouette
As you were moving through the crowd
Breathing hard, and your eyes were wet
So I called for you out loud
And when you finally turned around to find me
And I stood there in your gaze
I must've lost track of time
I could've been standing there for days
'Cause I know you like my mother's voice
Know you like the sky knows the wind
I've known you for a thousand years
And I know I'm gonna know you again
I swear I heard you say you love me
Before you kissed me long and slow
But you don't have to say nothing at all, baby
I know, I know
I ran my fingers down your dangerous curves
As you stood there so exposed
Like a hurricane rumbling, tumbling down
Atop a trembling rose
A thousand words gather on the tip of my tongue
But only 3 were undisclosed
Time stood still there between our lips
The thunder rumbled low
'Cause I know you like my mother's voice
Know you like the sky knows the wind
I've known you for a thousand years
And I know I'm gonna know you again
I swear I heard you say you love me
Before you kissed me long and slow
But you don't have to say nothing at all, baby
I know, I know
Now you don't have to say nothing at all, baby
I know, I know
You don't have to say nothing at all, baby
I know, I know
'Cause I know you like my mother's voice
Know you like the sky knows the wind
I've known you for a thousand years
And I know I'm gonna know you again
I swear I heard you say you love me
Before you kissed me long and slow
But you don't have to say nothing at all, baby
I know, I know
Baby, I know
I know
Baby, I know
I know
