Song Name: You, Me and a Bottle
I know lately things have been kind of tough
A lotta brokedown, a lotta beat up
When all my crash and burning
It won't stop the hurting
It don't take much to make it to all go away
Get it off my mind, set the world straight
When the lines all get tangled
Baby I'm so thankful
For one more day watching the night just fall
You, me, and a bottle
Under chandelier skies
Shining down on that look in your eye
Let's let another glass slow down the going too fast
Problems, no we ain't got em
When it's just you, me, and a bottle
Funny how time ain't changed a damn thing
Still the same kids, still the same dreams
Never running out of stars to wish on
I guarantee we will find one
Laying here
Under chandelier skies
Shining down on that look in your eye
Let's let another glass slow down the going too fast
Problems, no we ain't got em
When it's just you, me, and a bottle
You, me, and a bottle
You, me, and a bottle
You, me, and a bottle
Laying here
Under chandelier skies
Shining down on that look in your eye
Let's let another glass slow down the going too fast
Problems, no we ain't got em
Problems, no we ain't got em
When it's just you, me, and a bottle
