Song Name: No Such Thing as a Broken Heart
Keep your chin up
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up
How did my mom and my dad ever do it
If there was struggles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other, that was enough
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like
You're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's what's up
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like
You're jumping off a rope swing
Baby, 'cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your love like
You're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love (like there's no such thing)
You gotta love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
