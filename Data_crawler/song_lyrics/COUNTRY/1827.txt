Song Name: County Roads
I got a public education, but it didn't come from class
It came from long rides home on the bus in the back
Where we learned how to cuss from them high school kids
Throw a punch, take a punch, steal a kiss
Yeah, she had 2 years on me the day I turned 16
I had a fox body mustang, she had a body like a dream
We ran on young love, good music, cheap gasoline
Find out you could still go too far even when the tank's on "E"
Here's to the lessons that don't come cheap
To the long-lost lovers in the shotgun seat
Here's to the wild and restless souls
Who got their street smarts runnin' down them
County roads, county roads
County roads
That wrench in my hand sure put a wrench in my plans
But daddy said good help was hard to find
I guess I stood her up one too many Friday nights
She ended up in the truck with a buddy of mine, yeah
Here's to the lessons that don't come cheap
To the long-lost lovers in the shotgun seat
Here's to the wild and restless souls
Who got their street smarts runnin' down them
County roads, county roads
Na na-na, na na-na
County roads (na na, na-na-na na)
Na na-na, na na-na
Na na, na-na-na na
Here's to the hurt from that first hangover
Had us swearing we'd forever stay sober
Here's to the scrapes and the dents and the scars
On our boots, our cars, our reckless hearts, yeah
Here's to the lessons that don't come cheap
To the long-lost lovers in the shotgun seat
Here's to the wild and restless souls
Who got their street smarts runnin' down them
County roads, county roads
Na na-na, na na-na
County roads, county roads, yeah (na na, na-na-na na)
(Na na-na, na na-na) county roads
Na na, na-na-na na
Na na-na, na na-na
Na na, na-na-na na
Na na-na, na na-na
Na na, na-na-na na
