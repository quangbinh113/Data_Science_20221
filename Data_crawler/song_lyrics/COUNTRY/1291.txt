Song Name: Bluebird - Acoustic
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
I don't like where I'm at
34 was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah, I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like the records I'm playin'
They might keep you waitin'
But you know I'm gonna play 'em for keeps
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps givin' me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singin'
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Well, I'm a giver
Y'all, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgetting 'em well
Yeah, and I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a ten
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps givin' me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singin'
And all the stars go dark
I keep a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singin'
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a bluebird in my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And a bluebird sings
Ooh-ooh-ooh
