Song Name: Settle Me Down
What good's a highway without a destination?
What good's a house without someone to come home to?
What's a night at the top of the world without you there beside me?
No, there ain't no good in it without you
You settle me down when I go too far
When I burn too fast, when I lose my way
Hold onto me, whisper to my soul
Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break
Always got the wind at my back
But you still love me when I live like that
Open my eyes, keep me around
Pull me back in and settle me down
Settle me down
Still got the tendency to lean over the edges
I still got the urge to chase the dream until it ends
You don't fence me in
Yeah, you understand
But when I can't remember
You remind me who I am
You settle me down when I go too far
When I burn too fast, when I lose my way
Hold onto me, whisper to my soul
Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break
Always got the wind at my back
But you still love me when I live like that
Open my eyes, keep me around
Pull me back in and settle me down
Always got the wind at my back
But you still love me when I live like that
Open my eyes, keep me around
Pull me back in and settle me down
Follow me, I need you right now
Cover me up
And settle me down
Settle me down
