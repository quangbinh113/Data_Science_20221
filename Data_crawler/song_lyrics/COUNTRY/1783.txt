Song Name: Met the Devil in Oklahoma
He had eyes black as the night
Said he came from North Dakota
Wanna take me on a ride
I asked why he came to visit me
He said that's just what he does
Met the devil in Oklahoma
And he knew who I was
I've been sittin' on a river bank
Prayin' in Jesus name
To come and save my soul
I know time was never on my side
I've been waitin' for forever now
Hopin' that he comes around
And pulls me outta this whole
Cause I've run out of places to hide
Met the devil in Oklahoma
He shied from the light
Said I just wanna get to know ya
Couldn't see through his disguise
Took a step in the wrong direction
He got his hold on me
Met the Devil in Oklahoma
It's a tough time gettin' free
I've been sittin' on a river bank
Prayin' in Jesus name
To come and save my soul
I know time was never on my side
I've been waitin' for forever now
Hopin' that he comes around
And pulls me outta this whole
Cause I've run out of places to hide
Will I make it out alive
Or have my feet done crossed the line
Lord won't you tell me
Will I make it out alive
Or have my feet done crossed the line
Lord won't you tell me
I've been sittin' on a river bank
Prayin' in Jesus name
To come and save my soul
I know time was never on my side
I've been waitin' for forever now
Hopin' that he comes around
And pulls me outta this whole
Cause I've run out of places to hide
