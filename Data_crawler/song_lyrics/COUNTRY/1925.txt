Song Name: Can't Hide Love
Girl, you know you can't hide love
We been swervin' two lanes in my pickup truck
You got a perfect kiss and a perfect touch
Yeah, them rumors flyin' 'round 'cause they know what's up, yeah
And I been thinkin' 'bout the way it'd go
If you would let your walls down and open up that door, baby
Tell me anywhere you wanna go
'Cause we got nothin' but time in these old backroads, yeah
You gon' say you won't
But, girl, I know you just lied
'Cause if you get to sippin', baby
You might stay all night
You gon' curse me in the mornin'
You'll say that you're done
But I know you'll be right back here
'Cause, girl, you can't hide love
(Kidd G) yeah
Girl, we might just keep on countin' all the mistakes
And it don't matter what you do
'Cause, girl, you know this won't change (never change)
We can't give us up because we're still in love
And now you're back here ridin' shotgun in the seat of this truck
Run it back now
You gon' say you didn't
But I know you just lied
'Cause you just started sippin' whiskey
Now you're stayin' the night
You're gon' curse me in the mornin'
And say that we're done
But I know you'll be right back here
'Cause, girl, you can't hide love (no, you can't hide love, hey)
No, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't
No, you can't hide love (no, you can't hide love)
No, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't
No, you can't hide love
You gon' say you didn't
But I know you just lied (I know you just lied)
'Cause you just started sippin' whiskey
Now you're stayin' the night
You're gon' curse me in the mornin'
And say that we're done
But I know you'll be right back here
'Cause, girl, you can't hide love (no, you can't hide love)
No, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't
No, you can't hide love (no, you can't hide love)
No, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't
No, you can't hide love
Can't hide love, baby
