Song Name: All I Know About Girls
I'm a jack of all trade and a master of none
A renaissance man if there's ever been one
Got a pretty good handle on a lot of things
But I ain't figured out everything
'Cause all I know about girls
Is the wide world ain't gonna spin without 'em
But it'll spin around 'em
All I know about girls
Is your best get outta their way and
Shut your damn mouth if she got somethin' to say
It's like, yeah baby, no baby
Whatever you want, baby
Whatever it is, it's my fault
All I know about girls is
All I know about girls is
I don't know nothing at all
It's probably the reason Hemmingway drank
Or all the lovesick blues that were written by Hank
They all got stuck right where I am
Just like every other man
All I know about girls
Is the wide world ain't gonna spin without 'em
But it'll spin around 'em
All I know about girls
Is your best get outta their way and
Shut your damn mouth if she got somethin' to say
It's like, yeah baby, no baby
Whatever you want, baby
Whatever it is, it's my fault
All I know about girls is
And all I know about girls is
I don't know nothing at all, mmm
Yeah, I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none
But they sure make learnin' fun
All I know about girls
Is the wide world ain't gonna spin without 'em
But it'll spin around 'em
All I know about girls
Is your best get outta their way
Shut your damn mouth if she got somethin' to say
You be like, yeah baby, no baby
Whatever you want, baby
Whatever it is, it's my fault
All I know about girls is
All I know about girls is
I don't know nothing at all
All I know about girls is
I don't know nothing at all
I don't know nothing at all
