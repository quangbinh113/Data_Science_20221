Song Name: Next to You
You'd make a player get jealous, break up a band
Could take a lemon and sell it to a Nascar fan
Hell you could make Elvis forget how to dance
So baby I don't stand a chance
Next to you
I probably look like a fool
Turn every head in the room
One look at me and everybody sees it
I'm just lucky to be next to you
Next to you
Probably look like colder water
Dirty boots and diamond rings
Though we mix like love and summer
Like your first with my last name
Wanna spend forever
Next to you
I probably look like a fool
Turn every head in the room
One look at me and everybody sees it
I'm just lucky to be next to you
Next to you
Next to you
I probably look like a fool
Turn every head in the room
One look at me and everybody sees it
I'm just lucky to be next to you
I probably look like a fool
Knocking me out of my boots
I'm starting to think that God must've been sleeping girl
When he let me be next to you
Next to you
