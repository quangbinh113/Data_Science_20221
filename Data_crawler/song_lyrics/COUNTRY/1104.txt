Song Name: Coldest Fire
Have I become a lesser man
'Cause I don't want to fight nobody's war?
They said I'm living on the fence
But they don't see the war within my heart
This smile of mine it hides my rage and my pain
You can almost see these tears are bursting
I've been hiding it so long
This numbness got me hurting
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
Feel it burning
But I'm frozen
I'm in the coldest fire
I have always chosen peace
But they're surrounding me on every side
Been carrying the weight of more lifetimes
Than I've been alive
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
Feel it burning
But I'm frozen
Wanna scream, but I stay quiet
I don't got nobody on my side
And God knows that ain't right
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the cold
I'll be damned if I do, damned if I don't
But I won't be damned at all
We'll be damned if we do, damned if we don't
But we won't be damned, no
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
Feel it burning
But I'm frozen
Wanna scream, but I stay quiet
I don't got nobody on my side
And God knows that ain't right
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
Burning
But I'm frozen
Wanna scream, but I stay quiet
I don't got nobody on my side
And God knows that ain't right
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
I'm in the coldest fire
I'm in the cold
So come here darling
Hold me
I'm in the coldest fire
