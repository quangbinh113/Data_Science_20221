Song Name: Drunk Driving
Yeah, I'm just drunk driving again
Pulling away from all my sins
Tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends
When I'm out drunk driving again
I don't wanna leave you lonely but I've got to
'Cause it's only the things I need to prove
To you and everybody else
That scares me so damn much
I can't take it, I'm not strong
It's probably best that I move on
Get outta here, fade away
That's why I'm drunk driving again
Running away from all of my sins
And tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends
When I'm out drunk driving again
Everybody's gotta die somehow
Why not for me right now, right now
Well, I'm out drunk driving again
Drunk driving again
I'm drunk driving again
Running away from all of my sins
Tell my mother I lovе her and take care of my friеnds
'Cause I'm just drunk driving again
Yeah, I'm drunk driving again
