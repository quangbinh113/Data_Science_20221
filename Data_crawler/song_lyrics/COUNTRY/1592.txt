Song Name: Ragdoll
Take me out and rough me up
And I'll be ok
I'm not made of porcelain
I can handle the pain
I got a brand new jacket
Don't leave me hanging
Like art on the wall
I can be your ragdoll
Play with me
'Til you get tired
I'll sing you to sleep
I'm your favorite actor
Be whatever you need
I'm a sticher-upper
Killer-lover, ready to fall
If you need a ragdoll
Take me with you everywhere
We'll have a good time
I'll be waiting patiently
My partner in crime
Tell me I'm your everything
Or nothing at all
If you need a ragdoll
Won't you give me a call
Know you'll get distracted
By those new shiny things
When they catch your eye
I hope you'll remember me
With my 5 gold buttons
And my cheeks all blushing
You know we had a ball
Take me with you everywhere
We'll have a good time
I'll be waiting patiently
My partner in crime
Tell me I'm your everything
Or nothing at all
If you need a ragdoll
Everybody needs a ragdoll
I can be your ragdoll
