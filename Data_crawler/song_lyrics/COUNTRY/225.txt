Song Name: Love Triangle
Sittin' on the front step
Little white suitcase
Hearin' that diesel
'Fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burnin' down a Friday night
Southern Belle statue
Standin' in the screen door
Watchin' her whole world
Head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye
Then I run, to him
Big hug, jump in
And I cry for her
Out the window
Some mommas and daddies
Are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck
In a love triangle
Bowlin' alley burger
Fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old
Two-dollar matinee
'Baby, how's your school been
And how's your mom?'
Patsy Cline echoes
Back off the dashboard
Starin' at my boots
And the dusty old floorboards
Baby, two weeks ain't really all that long
Then I run, to her
Wrap my arms, around her skirt
And I cry for him
Out the window
Some mommas and daddies
Are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck
In a love triangle
Ooooou
Ooooou
In a love triangle oh ya
Ooooou
Ooooou
Some mommas and daddies
Are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle, oh
And some mommas and daddies
Ran outta love in '94
And some mommas and daddies
Don't even talk no more
And some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck
And some of us grow up
In a love triangle
