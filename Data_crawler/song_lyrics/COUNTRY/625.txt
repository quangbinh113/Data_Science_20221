Song Name: Bigger Than the Beatles
He plays guitar at a hotel bar
For out-of-towners and businessmen
He struts and sings to his drum machine
But he won't make it big at the Holiday Inn
But she thinks that he looks like Elvis
When he runs his fingers through that jet-black hair
And sometimes she forgets an order
'Cause she's so struck by him and stops and stares
They got a love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rollin' Stone
They got a love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet, sweet song
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah
She pours some drinks, loads up the sink
And dreams of bein' a movie star
Her mama said, "She'd knock 'em dead
But Hollywood hasn't called so far"
But he thinks she's as pretty as a picture
When she wipes down tables in her apron strings
And sometimes he forgets a chorus
'Cause she shinin' like a beauty on the silver screen
They got a love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rollin' Stone
They got a love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet, sweet song
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you won't find their names on the walk of fame
But they ain't missin' much
'Cause when the lights go down on Tinsel town
All you need is love
They got a love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rollin' Stone
They got a love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet, sweet song
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They got a love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They got a love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, they got a love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, they got a love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, got a love
