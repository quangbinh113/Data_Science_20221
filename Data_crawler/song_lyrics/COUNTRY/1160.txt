Song Name: Heads Carolina, Tails California
Baby, what do you say we just get lost?
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin
Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses searchin' for the Promised Land
We can go 400 miles before we stop for gas
We could drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map
Oh, heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
We're gonna get out of here
If we gotta ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's tailin' us
Oh, heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
Oh, California
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Carolina, California
