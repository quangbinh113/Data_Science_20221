Song Name: Boys 'Round Here (feat. Pistol Annies & Friends)
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck
Well, the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp all night
What? (That's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, diggin' in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your four-wheel drive (a country boy can survive)
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinkin' that ice-cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' 'em red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw, heck!
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck
Well, the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?) No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here, yep, they still love me
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie Crystal
They like that y'all and Southern drawl
And just can't help it 'cause they just keep fallin'
For the boys 'round here
Drinkin' that ice-cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit (let me hear you stay)
(Ooh, let's ride) through the countryside
(Ooh, let's ride) down to the riverside
Hey now, girl, hop inside (ooh, let's ride)
Me and you gon' take a little ride to the river (ooh), let's ride
(That's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground (ooh, let's ride)
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound (ooh, let's ride)
We out of town
Have you ever got down with a
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck? (Ooh, let's ride)
And do you wanna get down with a
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck? (Ooh, let's ride)
Girl, you gotta get down
With the boys 'round here
Drinkin' that ice-cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
(Ooh, let's ride) aw, heck!
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck
(Ooh, let's ride)

Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck
(Ooh, let's ride)
Well, all I'm thinkin' 'bout is you and me, how we'll be (ooh, let's ride)
(Ooh let's ride)
So come on, girl, hop inside (ooh, let's ride)
It's me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
(Ooh, let's ride) hmm, yeah
Lay a blanket on the ground (ooh, let's ride)
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound (ooh, let's ride)
We out of town, yeah
(Ooh, let's ride) girl, you gotta get down with a...
(Ooh, let's ride)
(Ooh, let's ride) mmm, come on through the countryside
(Ooh, let's ride) down to the riverside
