Song Name: Cowboy Casanova
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease

You're runnin' and tryin' and tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse; he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding ya down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again 'cause I been where ya been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes (oh, oh)
He'll tell you nothing but lies (oh, oh)
And you wanna believe that you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart; it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life (oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life (oh, oh)
