Song Name: Wings
I wish I had wings
Take me away
From all that I see
And all the trouble I've made
I wish I could fly
High above everything
Oh I, I wish I had wings
I'd dance with the angels
Cut through the clouds
Never look back
Never come back down
Drunk on the wind
And the high it brings
Free once again, it never ends
Oh I, I wish I had wings
I wish I had wings
Instead of all these memories
I almost believed
They couldn't follow me
I could fly high
High above everything
Oh I, I wish I had wings
