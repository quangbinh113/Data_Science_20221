Song Name: Headstone
My skin ain't thin but when I come unhinged
I'm a little bit more than crazy
Work like a dog but the way I talk
Is a little laid back and lazy
I'm not a man of many words
But my words are as good as gold
And you can bet your ass I'll have your back
When the rubber meets the road
Write that on my headstone
Write that on my headstone
Off the rails, off the walls
Never was the one to back down
Gave it hell and I had a ball
Like tomorrow was never coming back 'round
Live to love and love to live
Like the lights are never coming back on
Day and night, night and day
I did it my way, right or wrong
It's a wonder that I made it this long
Write that on my headstone
Write that on my headstone
Yeah, when I'm dead and gone
Write that on my headstone
Here lies a man who gave a damn
Wasn't scared to stand for something
Lived it hard and fast in that dash carved between those numbers
And if you're reading this
You can reminisce but don't cry for me brother
Pour enough whiskey on this grave
To make it all the way down six feet under
Write that on my headstone
Write that on my headstone
Yeah, when I'm dead and gone
Write that on my headstone
Yeah
Yeah, write that on my headstone
Headstone
Headstone
