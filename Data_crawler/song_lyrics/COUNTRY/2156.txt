Song Name: The Highway Kind
Well, the downtown streets never got me where I was going
The scratching gravel, dead ends ain't my style
I was made for white lines that go on and on forever
Guys like me don't count the days, we just stack the miles
I've always been the highway kind
Moving at the speed of time
Running the sunset down my way out
Where free and easy goes
I'll get there when I get there
Long as I'm going somewherе
Sea to shining, keep on winding
Cowboy state of mind
I've always been thе highway kind
My road map's got a jagged reputation
My rearview don't hold grudges or regrets
With Justins on the asphalt, got the salt of North Dakota
And I got Arizona goodbye dust stuck inside the tred
I've always been the highway kind
Moving at the speed of time
Running the sunset down my way out
Where free and easy goes
I'll get there when I get there
Long as I'm going somewhere
Sea to shining, keep on winding
Cowboy state of mind
I've always been the highway kind
I've always been the highway kind
Well, the downtown streets never got me where I was going
I've always been the highway kind
I'm moving at the speed of time
I've always been the highway kind
I've always been the highway kind
