Song Name: First
You were the first girl
I ever let try to drive my truck
First fall I didn't care at all about a buck
'Cause I was spending all of my time trying
Just to get you to be mine
You were the first girl
To make this boy wanna settle down
First time in my life I ever thought about
Getting outta the fast lane
And putting someone's first with my last name
And I made a promise to your daddy
I'd always put you first
But there's just one time I really hope that i
Don't have to keep my word
When that hourglass runs outta sand
And the good Lord calls us home
When this needle runs outta record
And these tires run outta road
There's gonna come a day, not soon I pray
That one of us has gotta go
And girl without you here with me
It'd be Hell on earth
(Be Hell on earth)
So I hope heaven takes me first
I'd be the first smile to greet you
Right there at the gate
First one to show you all around the place
Hope it don't sound selfish
That I wanna beat you there
'Cause if you went first
I couldn't handle the hurt, I swear
When that hourglass runs outta sand
And the good Lord calls us home
When this needle runs outta record
And these tires run outta road
There's gonna come a day, not soon I pray
That one of us has gotta go
And girl without you here with me
It'd be Hell on Earth
(Be Hell on Earth)
So I hope Heaven takes me first
Girl, I promise for as long as I can
I'll always put you first
But there's just one time
I really hope that I don't have to keep my word
When that hourglass runs outta sand
And the good Lord calls us home
When this needle runs outta record
And these tires run outta road
There's gonna come a day, not soon I pray
That one of us has gotta go
And girl without you here with me
It'd be Hell on Earth
(Be Hell on Earth)
So I hope Heaven takes me first
Heaven takes me first
Take me first
