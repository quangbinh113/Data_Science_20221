Song Name: Girl In A Country Song
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's gettin' kinda cold in these painted-on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
(Yeah, baby)
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' in
Sayin', "Hey girl", but you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name, and to you it ain't
Pretty little thing, honey or baby
It's drivin' me red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck crazy
Bein' the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't ever made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time you gotta get you some of that
Sure I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped, huh
These days it ain't easy being that...
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is looking good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Yep, yep, yeah baby
Aw naw
Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw naw
We ain't a cliche
That ain't no way
To treat a lady
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song
Yeah baby
I ain't your tan legged Juliet
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw naw
