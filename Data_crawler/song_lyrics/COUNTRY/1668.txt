Song Name: The Way I Oughta Go
Yet another sleepless night, no dreaming
I woke again to the absence of your words
To a big old empty bed and that feeling
I could scream at the top of my voice
And still I would not be heard
And I know in the morning where you'll find me
Staring at the ceiling on my own
Well, my mama fell in love in East Virginia
Well, maybe Richmond's the way I oughta to go
I was raised on the trust and wishful thinking
That my mama instilled in me when I was born
Well, sometimes it got away without my knowing
But mostly, it just helped me to be bold
And now, I'm so scared of what might happen
Or maybe I'm just too young to know
For, at least, that's what the people like to tell me
Especially the ones that I thought I loved the most
And I know in the morning where you'll find me
Staring at the ceiling on my own
Well, my daddy fell in love in North Carolina
Maybe Charlotte's the way I oughta go
Now to me, the word love has lost all meaning
It's just an empty sound I thought I'd always known
For my daddy used to sing it to my mama
But then he went and he left her all alone
And I know in the morning where you'll find me
Staring at the ceiling on my own
Well, dreaming never met me in Alberta
So I packed my things, Tennessee I did go
Well, dreaming never met me in Alberta
So I packed my things, Tennessee I did go
