Song Name: Daddy Sang Bass
I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a livin' out of black land dirt
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
'Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
Oh, no the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
