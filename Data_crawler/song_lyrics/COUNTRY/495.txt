Song Name: Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw somethin' I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that
And I said, "Hey, pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call"
Yeah, I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold to the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye
Well, the auctioneer was goin' 'bout a mile a minute
He was takin' bids and callin' them out loud
And I guess I was really gettin' in it
'Cause I just shouted out above the crowd
And I said, "Hey, pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call"
Yeah, I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold to the lady in the long black dress
Well she won my heart, it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah, we found love on the auction block and I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about, the way we met that day
When I said, "Hey, pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call"
Yeah, I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold to the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye hee
