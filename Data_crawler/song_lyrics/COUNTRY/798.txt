Song Name: Always Gonna Love You
Like my mama's home cooking after Sunday church
Like an ice cold beer after hard work
Like a hot cup of coffee on your way to town
Like an underdog last second touchdown
Like the feeling that you get when you get a bite
Like the power of a throttle when it's open wide
When the sand runs out of that hourglass
You ain't ever gotta wonder, you ain't gotta ask
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever, something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, yeah
Love them freckles that you get in the summertime
And the way you get giddy off a glass of wine
Even the way you take forever and you never on time
Ain't a thing not to love, ain't no wonder why, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever, something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, yeah
I'm always gonna love you, yeah, yeah
I'm always gonna love you
Oh, yes I am
If you ever second guess (I, I, I, I, I)
Baby, just remember this and don't you ever forget
Ever forget that, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever, something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, yeah
