Song Name: If I Was a Cowboy
Woah-oo-woo, woah-oo-woo
Woah-oo-woo, woah-oo-woo
Ridin' off in the sunset, blue eyes under my Stetson
A little lady on the front porch wishin' my heart would start settling
Big iron hips with the holsters
I'd be lookin' mighty fine on a poster
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen
Woah-oo-woo, woah-oo-woo
Sittin' pretty on the prairie, baby
I'm your Huckleberry, let me hold ya
This six-gun sugar's got a hairpin trigger, like I told ya
And this dove never really gets lonesome
I never begged, never borrowed but I stole some
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me, baby
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen
So mamas if your daughters grow up
To be cowboys, so what?
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds (tumbling tumbleweeds)
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me (up with me)
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen
Woah-oo-woo
I'd be the queen
Woah-oo-woo, woah-oo-woo
Woah-oo-woo, woah-oo-woo
