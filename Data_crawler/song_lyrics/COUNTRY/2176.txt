Song Name: Easy as Hello
It didn't take six months to figure it out
How to get the words outta my mouth
I just walked in, and introduced myself
Earth didn't shatter, hearts didn't break
The only question I had was, "What's your name?"
Didn't need a drink, I didn't need any help
Nothing to it, it rolled off my tongue
No second thoughts, no damage done
Thought you were the one for a couple of years
I've never been the girl lost for words
I don't know how to say it, 'cause it's gonna hurt
This is what happens when love turns to tears
If goodbye were as easy as hello
Could forget about someone you held so close
Pack it up and just move on down the road
Sleeping like a baby every night
Wake up in the morning and feel alright
Wouldn't be such a heavy load
If goodbye were as easy as hello
It's just one word, shouldn't be that tough
But I finally realized, enough is enough
Shouldn't linger in the air or echo down the hall
As soon as I'd say it, it would be done
Then both of us could finally move on
And get out from under the weight of it all
If goodbye were as easy as hello
Could forget about someone you held so close
Pack it up and just move on down the road
Sleep like a baby every night
Wake up in the morning and feel alright
Wouldn't be such a heavy load
If goodbye were as easy as hello
If goodbye were as easy as hello
Could forget about someone you held so close
Pack it up and just move on down the road
Sleep like a baby every night
Wake up in the morning and feel alright
No, it wouldn't be such a heavy load
If goodbye were as easy as hello
If goodbye were as easy as hello
