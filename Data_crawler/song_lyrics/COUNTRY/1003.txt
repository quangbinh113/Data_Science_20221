Song Name: St. Louis
I can hear the crowd
The sea of red
My favorite shirt
Willie was my favorite
Bought a souvenir
A few too many beers
I whispered I love you
As fireworks filled the sky
When I think about St. Louis
I can't help but think of you
There's just something about this city
Whenever I come passing through
I can't help but reminisce
If I had known it'd be our last kiss
Oh, I never would left, left you in St. Louis

I got the call
Out on the road
Somewhere out west
I never can remember
You were holding on
No, I couldn't sleep
I just held the phone
Took the first flight out that morning
When I think about St. Louis
I can't help but think of you
There's just something about this city
Whenever I come passing through
I can't help but reminisce
If I had known it'd be our last kiss
Oh, I would never left, left you in St. Louis
Somewhere over Kansas
I looked across the sky
Knew you left for heaven
Felt you say goodbye
When I think about St. Louis
I can't help but think of you
There's just something about this city
Whenever I come passing through
I can't help but reminisce
If I had known it'd be our last kiss
No, I would never left
Never left you in St. Louis
In St. Louis
