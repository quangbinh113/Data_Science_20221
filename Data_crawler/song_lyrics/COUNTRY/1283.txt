Song Name: What He Didn't Do - Acoustic
Everybody's asking what the hell happened
Wonderin' why it all went wrong
Mama always said, "If you can't say something nice
Then don't say anything at all"
And I've got my side of the story
And he's got his side too
So I ain't gonna go and tell you what he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do
Treat me right, put me first
Be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love
Hold on tight like it's somethin'
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
I'm already halfway over him
And I ain't takin' time to turn around
So I'ma take the high road
Even though we both know
I could run him out of this town
That's just dirty laundry
I don't need to air the truth
So I ain't gonna tell you everything he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do
Treat me right, put me first
Be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love
Hold on tight like it's somethin'
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
I ain't met the right one yet
But I know when I do
He'll treat me right, put me first
Be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love
Hold on tight like it's something
That he can't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
And all I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
