Song Name: Because Of Yours
I know more about my self then I ever cared to know
Been places in the past most would never go
Can't find all the pieces to a heart this broke
I made it throught the fire but I still smell like smoke
I've gone from givin' up throwing in the towel, lookin for a way out
To lovin' every minute of my life, lovin every minute of my life
And now, lookin' back it's a miracle how I found something worth livin' for
Lovin' every minute of my life, lovin' every minute of my life
Because of yours, there's breath to breathe my heart still beats
Because of yours
I know the view from the bottom just a little too well
Don't know much about heaven but a lot about hell
Time was something I was waitin' on to just slip away
Sand through the hands of a man too ashamed to pray
I've gone from givin' up throwing in the towel, lookin for a way out
To lovin' every minute of my life, lovin every minute of my life
And now, lookin' back it's a miracle how I found something worth livin' for
Lovin' every minute of my life, lovin' every minute of my life
Because of yours, there's breath to breathe my heart still beats
Because of yours
I've gone from givin' up throwing in the towel, to where I am now
Lovin' every minute of my life, lovin every minute of my life
And now, lookin' back it's a miracle how I found something worth livin' for
Lovin' every minute of my life, lovin' every minute of my life
Because of yours, there's breath to breathe my heart still beats
Because of yours
