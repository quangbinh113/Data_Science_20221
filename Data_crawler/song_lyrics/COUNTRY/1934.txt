Song Name: Worth A Shot (feat. Dierks Bentley)
We've been turnin' into strangers
Now we barely even touch
Superficial conversation
'Cause our guard is always up
I'm not ready to give up on us yet
One last hurrah, it might just do the trick
Might be in a bottle
A little proof from the past
Might be at the bottom
Of an empty glass
Don't know if the whiskey can fix it or not
But, baby, it's worth a shot
One shot from the top of the shelf
Maybe two, what the hell
'Cause we've been on the rocks
One shot may be all that we got
I don't know about you, but I think it's worth a shot
(Yeah)
If we could lose our inhibitions
And say what we need to say
Then maybe both of us can listen
And get our pride out of the way
'Cause I'm still the guy that used to make you laugh, mmm
What would it take for us to get this back?
Yeah
Might be in a bottle
A little proof from the past
Might be at the bottom
Of an empty glass
Don't know if the whiskey can fix it or not
But, baby, it's worth a shot
One shot from the top of the shelf
Maybe two, what the hell
'Cause we've been on the rocks
One shot may be all that we got
I don't know about you, but I think it's worth a shot

I think it's worth a shot
Maybe if we find ourselves in that old familiar neon glowin'
Maybe we can stop the gone before it's going
(Yeah)
Might be in a bottle
A little proof from the past
Might be at the bottom
Of an empty glass
Don't know if the whiskey can fix it or not
But, baby, it's worth a shot
One shot from the top of the shelf
Maybe two, what the hell
'Cause we've been on the rocks
One shot may be all that we got
I don't know about you, but I think it's worth a shot

I think it's worth a shot

I think it's worth a shot

(I think it's worth a shot)
(I think it's worth a shot)
