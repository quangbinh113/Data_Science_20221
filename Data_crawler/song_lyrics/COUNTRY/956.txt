Song Name: I Ain't Ever Loved No One - Acoustic
I guess before I met you
I didn't know better
But you swept in out of nowhere
And I thought I'd never go there
And you set the bar for this stubborn heart
And when you met my family
Everybody knew that you had me wrapped
I ain't ever loved no one like that
And when I said I loved you
I didn't care if you said it back
I ain't ever loved no one like that
If you'd have just kept walking
And we'd never got to talking
I could go on existing
Not knowin' what I was missing
But you set the bar for this stubborn heart
And when you met my family
Everybody knew that you had me wrapped
I ain't ever loved no one like that
And when I said I loved you
I didn't care if you said it back
I ain't ever loved no one like that
And maybe I'll love again, then again, maybe I won't
Maybe you feel the same, maybe you don't
How would I know?
'Cause when you met my family
Everybody knew that you had me wrapped
I ain't ever loved no one like that
And when I said I loved you
I didn't care if you said it back
I ain't ever loved no one like that
I ain't ever loved no one like that
I ain't ever loved no one like that
I ain't ever loved no one like that
