Song Name: Oklahoma Christmas (feat. Reba)
Let's have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
We'll have an old-fashioned two-steppin' time around our old tree
We'll have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
Power lines are down all over town
Our 40 Westbound is a sheet of ice
Heard the weatherman say more is on the way
Guess we ain't goin' nowhere tonight
Oh, so call up granny and tell her the news
But even if it's only me and you
We'll have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Let's have an old-fashioned two stepping' time round our little old tree
We'll have oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Hey, even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
It don't seem right if we don't have a big slice
Of Aunt Bea's pecan pie on our plate
But we can make do
Hey, I'll whip up two big old golden brown chicken fried steaks
So put on some Bob Wills to set the mood
I think I've even have a six pack of 3.2
We'll have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Let's have an old-fashioned two-steppin' time around that little old tree
We'll have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Oh, even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
So baby, it's okay, don't get the blues
Yeah, all we really need is me and you
To have an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
We'll have an old fashioned two-steppin' time around our little old tree
Two-steppin'
Oh, we'll have an an oh-oh-oh-oh Oklahoma Christmas
Even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
Oh, even if we have to have it here in Tennessee, yeah
