Song Name: Slow Dance In A Parking Lot - Acoustic
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm takin' you home
Hopin' for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow is hittin' your eyes
Makin' me lose everything that's on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and just throw it in park and just
Slow dance with you
Spinnin' you 'round by the Walmart sign
And movin' our feet over the painted white lines
Gettin' close to you
Makin' the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
Half song gone
One door open across the lot
Rent-a-cop's rollin' a security car
Yellow lights spinnin' and flashin' in time
To the radio, singin' a little Garth Brooks
You start hummin' the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm fallin' right here, don't want a safety net
And a slow dance with you
Spinnin' you 'round by the Walmart sign
And movin' our feet over the painted white lines
Gettin' close to you
Makin' the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot, yeah
Oh, in a parking lot
And get close to you
Makin' the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just
A slow dance with you
Spinnin' you 'round by the Walmart sign
And movin' our feet over the painted white lines
Gettin' close to you
Makin' the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot, yeah
Oh, in a parking lot
