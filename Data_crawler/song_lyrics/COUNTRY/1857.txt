Song Name: Am I The Only One
Well it was Friday in the P.M. and just like every weekend,
I was ready to throw down.
Yeah I get a little tore up,
So I call my bros up to meet me out on town.
Well Wild Man Willie said "I'd like to really" but Idol was on TV.
And Ray had a date with his wife
And they quit drinking but he didn't tell me.
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer,
Kick it 'til the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will, but y'all that ain't right.
It's time to get it on,
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Well I was flyin' solo down at Silverado's,
The joint lookin' like a morgue.
When this country cutie with a rock on roll booty came struttin' in through the door.
Yelled "Who wants to dance?" and fired up the band with a Franklin and a shot of Patron.
She looked right at me, said "What's gonna be?
Are you gonna let me to party alone?"
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer,
Kick it 'til the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will, but y'all that ain't right.
Yeah it's time to get it on, am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Come on come on
