Song Name: Country Boy's Dream Girl
Some boys like heels and short skirts
Rooftop girls and twenty dollar drinks
Some boys want them pretty as a picture
Hanging on their arm, not saying a thing
Ooh, if that's what you're looking for
Ooh, then I ain't what you're looking for
But if you wanna ride real slow
Winding down a red dirt road
Maybe crank a little old George Jones
Something in your sweet tea
You're barking up the right tree
If you like a sky full of stars
You ain't gotta look too far
Love you on the back porch
Kiss you on the dance floor
In a t-shirt and faded jeans
I'm a country boy's dream girl
Girls like me like to kick it on a river bank
And go out in cowboy boots
Fire in a field, tailgate, four wheels
Sixer on ice with nothing to do
I can make your wish come true
If you wanna ride real slow
Winding down a red dirt road
Maybe crank a little Curtis Loew
Something in your sweet tea
You're barking up the right tree
If you like a sky full of stars
You ain't gotta look too far
Love you on the back porch
Kiss you on the dance floor
In a t-shirt and faded jeans
I'm a country boy's dream girl
Ooh, if that's what you're looking for
Ooh, then boy, I'm what you're looking for
If you wanna ride real slow
Winding down a red dirt road
Maybe crank a little old George Jones
Something in your sweet tea
You're barking up the right tree
If you like a sky full of stars
You ain't gotta look too far
Love you on the back porch
Kiss you on the dance floor
In a t-shirt and faded jeans
I'm a country boy's dream girl
I'm a country boy's dream girl
I'm a country boy's dream girl
