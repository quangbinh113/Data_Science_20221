Song Name: I Need You (feat. Ashley Monroe)
There ain't no need to worry
Oh, it ain't no use to cry
'Cause i'll be coming home soon
To keep you satisfied
And you know i get so lonely
That i feel i can't go on
But it feels so good inside baby
Just to call you on the telephone
And i said
Ooh baby, i love you
What more can i say?
Ooh baby, i need you
I miss you more everyday
Everyday
Woke up early this morning
As the sun came shining down
It found me wishing and hoping
That you'd come back around
You know that i need you
So much more than the air i breathe, oh
And i guess i'm just trying to tell you
Woman what you mean to me
And i said
Ooh baby, i love you
What more can i say?
Ooh baby, i need you
I miss you more everyday
Everyday, oh
I'm trying to tell you i love you
Each and every way
Trying to tell you
I need your sweet loving
So much more and more every day, ahh
Yeah uhhhhh
