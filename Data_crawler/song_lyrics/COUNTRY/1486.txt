Song Name: Fast Lane
The smoke and the booze
They don't treat me like they did back then
Little white pills we all took
To forget where we'd been
And I've seen firsthand
What that needle has done to my friend
Thank God, I'm still here to stay away
From the places I've been
You got to slow down
While you can still see the miles
Put on the brakes in the fast lane
And rest for a while
When you live with your demons long enough
They seem like your friends
So, put on the brakes in the fast lane
Before your road ends
That first cigarette didn't do much
The second one did
First taste of whiskey was good
When I was a kid
So, I'll tell you firsthand "Hey, I know now"
I've been where you are
In ways, I am still just some kid
With eyes for the stars
You got to slow down
While you can still see the miles
Put on the brakes in the fast lane
And rest for a while
When you live with your demons long enough
They seem like your friends
So, put on the brakes in the fast lane
Before your road ends
