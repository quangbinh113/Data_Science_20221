Song Name: Holly Jolly Christmas
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly
Have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
(Yeah, it's nice)
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly
Have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
