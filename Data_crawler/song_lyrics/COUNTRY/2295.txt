Song Name: Take the Highway
Take the highway
Lord knows I've been gone too long
Lot of sad days, yeah
One day you'll turn around
And I'll be gone
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Hear me say...
I'll be back someday
But darlin' please don't
Wait for me too long
There's just one place I can't stay
Memories of your love still linger on
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Here me say...
Take the highway
Take the highway
Take the highway
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Here me say...
