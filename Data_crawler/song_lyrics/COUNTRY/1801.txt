Song Name: Almost Maybes
I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard
I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the hey I think we need to talk
And the it ain't me, it's you
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavings
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the hey I think we need to talk
And the it ain't me, it's you
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (For the almost maybes)
Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the hey, I think we need to talk
And the it ain't me, it's you
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes
