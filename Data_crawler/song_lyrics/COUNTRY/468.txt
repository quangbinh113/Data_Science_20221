Song Name: Red Ragtop
I was 20 and she was 18
We were just about as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
She'd pick me up in that red ragtop
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops on a summer night
Running all the red lights
And we'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
We were cooking with gas, knew it had to last
In the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please don't stop"
Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be for two weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets in the morning light
But on the way home that night
On the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please don't stop loving me"
We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make-believe in the end
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time, drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green, and I was in an old scene
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped loving me
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped loving me
