Song Name: Turnt
Shot of Jack in the right hand
And a bottle in the left
Starin' at the door
You just don't nag anyway
Baby what's the same about lovin' and lettin' go?
But it don't matter how I'll let you go now
I know you ain't comin' home
Cuz I'll still be here
And you'll still be gone
Baby I'm brawled down and turnt out
I messed up there's no doubt
And tonight I'm gettin' drunk without you
Cuz if I drink enough to get wasted
Go wild I'll just forget
How easy girl you left to turn me loose
So baby here's to you
Tonight I'm bustin' out the good stuff
And I swore I wouldn't drink
'Til you marry me but I watch you leave
With my heart and not that ring
And now that you're gone
I don't wanna feel a single thing
Cuz baby I'm brawled down and turnt out
I messed up there's no doubt
And tonight I'm gettin' drunk without you
Cuz if I drink enough to get wasted
Go wild I'll just forget
How easy girl you left to turn me loose
So baby here's to you
I'm going down, down for the count
Try to drown at the sound of the silence
You left in this house
What I get for just one more howl
Baby I'm brawled down and turnt out
I messed up there's no doubt
And tonight I'm gettin' drunk without you
Cuz if I drink enough to get wasted
Go wild I'll just forget
How easy girl you left to turn me loose
So baby here's to you
So baby here's to you
