Song Name: Two Sparrows In A Hurricane
She's 15, and he's barely driving a car

She's got his ring, and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And fate that can move anything

They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it
But love says they will

There's a baby crying, and one more on the way

There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills they can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And fate that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it
But love says they will
She's 83 and he's barely driving a car

She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And fate that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it
But love says they will
