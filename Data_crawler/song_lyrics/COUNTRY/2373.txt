Song Name: Payback (feat. The Cadillac Three)
Front of the line, straight past the bouncer
Looking so fine that the band announced you
Got your tight jeans on, your hair done right
All your girlfriends say we're getting drunk tonight
Let me guess, somebody done you wrong
And you're looking for a way to get your feel good on
And get some pictures on the internet
Show him what he's missing
Straight, no chaser, girl on a mission
Mmm baby, I could be your payback
Mmm, I could help you get your sway back
Take you to the dance floor
I'm gon' lean you way back
Yeah, I'm gon' lean you way back
Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl
Put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game, yeah
Baby, I can be your payback
I'll bet he's sittin' at home
All alone in the dark
Texting like mad
Wants to know where you are
'Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it
Shoulda known runnin' around was gonna cost him
Now no way that girl is pretty as you
I never even seen her, but I know that it's true
And if he was worth a damn then he wouldn't have blown it
Think about it that way, feels good, don't it?
Mmm baby, I could be your payback
Mmm, I could help you get your sway back
Take you to the dance floor
I'm gon' lean you way back
Yeah, I'm gon' lean you way back
Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl
Put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game, yeah
Baby, I can be your payback
Mmm baby, I could be your payback, yeah
I can lean you way back
I can lean you way
Mmm, baby, I could be your payback
Mmm, I could help you get your sway back
Take you to the dance floor
I'm gon' lean you way back
Awe yeah, he's gonna hate that
Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl
Put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game, yeah
Baby, I can be your payback
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
