Song Name: Grandma Got Run over by a Reindeer
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house, Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house, Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Now we're all so proud of Grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there, watching football
Drinkin' beer and playing cards with Cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts or send them back? Send them back!
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house, Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig (ah!)
And a blue and silver candles
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
"Better watch out for yourselves!"
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house, Christmas Eve
And you can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Sing it, Grandpa
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house, Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Merry Christmas
