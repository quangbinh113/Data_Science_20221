Song Name: Boots On
Man, I've been working too hard
Ten hour days and I'm tired
Damn this knuckle busted',
Back breakin', no paying job
Know where I'm goin from here
Hot headed women, cold beer
Kick up my heels for a little while
And do it country style.
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that Copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on.
How I keep catching her eye
Man, I keep wondering why
Ain't nothing special 'bout
An "awe shucks" country boy
Lord, she's sure lookin' good
Like something from Hollywood
She got me thinkin' that I just might
Leave here with her tonight.
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that Copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on.
'Cause I am who I am and that's
The man I'm gonna be, yeah
And when the Lord comes callin',
Well, he ain't gonna have
To holler, y'all
There'll be no trouble finding me.
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that Copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on.
With my boots on
He's gonna take me home
Lord, with my boots on
