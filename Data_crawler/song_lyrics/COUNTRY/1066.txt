Song Name: By The Time I Get To Phoenix - Remastered 2001
By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be rising
And she'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
And she'll laugh, when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl, so many times before
And by the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch
Lord and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall
And that's all
And by the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
Lord and she'll cry, just to think, I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so, God knows
If she just didn't know
That I would really go
Though she didn't know I know
She didn't know I know
