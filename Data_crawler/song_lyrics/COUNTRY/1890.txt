Song Name: Raised Right
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
At your worst, be on your best
Do unto others like the good Lord says
Unless you cross me or one of my girlfriends
Say what you mean, mean what you say
Take your secrets to the grave
I grew up that way, and I wouldn't change one damn thing
I'm a little bit of whiskey in my sweet tea
I'm a little bit of city in my country
A little "hell yeah" in my "hallelujah" (hallelujah)
I know I ain't always ladylike
But I know how to turn up on a Saturday night
'Cause I was baptized in the neon light
I got a little bit of wrong in my raised right
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
My daddy taught me how to give
More than I take, but don't take no shit
I flip that switch, call me crazy if you wanna
But y'all never met my mama
I'm a little bit of whiskey in my sweet tea
I'm a little bit of city in my country
A little "hell yeah" in my "hallelujah" (hallelujah)
I know I ain't always ladylike
But I know how to turn up on a Saturday night
'Cause I was baptized in the neon light
I got a little bit of wrong in my raised right
(I was raised right, I was raised right)
(I was raised right, raised right)
(I was raised right, I was raised right)
(I was raised right, raised right)
I'm a little bit of whiskey in my sweet tea
I'm a little bit of city in my country
I'm a little bit of whiskey in my sweet tea (in my sweet tea)
I'm a little bit of city in my country (in my country)
A little "hell yeah" in my "hallelujah" (hallelujah)
I know I ain't always ladylike
But I know how to turn up on a Saturday night
'Cause I was baptized in the neon light
I got a little bit of wrong in my raised right
(I got a little bit of wrong) yeah, in my raised right
(Little bit of wrong) I got a little bit of wrong in my raised right
(Got a little bit of wrong)
(I got a little bit of wrong) in my raised right (oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
