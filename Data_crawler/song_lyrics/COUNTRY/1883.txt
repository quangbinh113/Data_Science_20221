Song Name: I Don't Go Back
I don't cry, but if I did
There'd be an Eric Church song playin' in my car
Drivin' past the blue school doors that are faded
I'm not sad, but if I was
There'd be a 97 left 250 drivin' away
In my head while I'm in Nashville feelin' guilty
I'ma movin' on straight ahead
Eyes on the road always does me best
I'm out the old, in for new
Yeah, I don't go back
But if I did, it'd be to you, you, you, yeah
I don't go reminiscin'
But when I do, it's usually when I've been drinkin'
Like tonight still thinkin' 'bout you
Playin' pool in your mama's basement
I don't wanna be 17 again
I don't go chasin' around could've been's
And I don't regret
That ain't me but if I did I know whеre I'd be
'Cause I'ma movin' on straight ahead
Eyеs on the road always does me best
I'm out the old, in for new
Yeah, I don't go back
But if I did, it'd be to you, you, you, yeah
I don't miss who I was
I'm exactly where I wanna be now
I'm missing tears, this ain't no flood
Just a song that I can't turn down
I don't cry
But if I did, there'd be an Eric Church song playin'
I'ma movin' on straight ahead
Eyes on the road always does me best
I'm out the old, in for new
Yeah, I don't go back
But if I did, it'd be to you, you, you, yeah
It'd be to you, you, you
