Song Name: 'Til You Can't
You can tell your old man
You'll do some large-mouth fishing another time
You just got too much on your plate
To bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't
You can keep putting off forever
With that girl whose heart you hold
Swearing that you'll ask someday, further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand
'Til you can't
If you got a chance, take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
There's a box of greasy parts sitting in the trunk of that '65
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixing up that Pontiac
'Til you can't
If you got a chance, take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause your dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold on as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
So take that phone call from your mama
And just talk away
'Cause you never know how bad you wanna
'Til you can't someday
Don't wait on tomorrow, 'cause tomorrow may not show
Say your sorry's, your I love you's
'Cause man, you never know
If you got a chance, take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
Yeah, if you got a chance, take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
Until you can't
'Til you can't
Yeah, take it
