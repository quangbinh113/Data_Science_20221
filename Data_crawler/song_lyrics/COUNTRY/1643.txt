Song Name: Where Ya Been?
Where ya been?
Hey, mister, in the mirror, where's my friend?
I went out on the town
And I ain't seen him since
Hey-ey, where ya been?
Well, I shuffled off to the South
I took her right outside the lines
And I stopped to greet a stranger at the wall
Hey, feller, me and my friend, could we come on in?
I heard in here they like to pour 'em tall
Where ya been?
Hey, mister, in the mirror, where's my friend?
I went out on the town
And I ain't seen him since
Hey-ey, where ya been?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
When I turned to my left and grinned
I turned and lost my friend
The air was thick and sticking to my clothes
So, I waited around 'til the end
Though I said I'd stay 'til 10
Everybody here knows that's how it goes
Where ya been?
Hey, mister, in the mirror, where's my friend?
I went out on the town
And I ain't seen him since
Hey-ey, where ya been?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I are, I are, leaning on the end of the bar
I outta to take my car 'cause I like to keep my keys
More now and then, I come looking for my friend
Ain't it funny how nobody saw him leave
Where ya been?
Hey, mister, in the mirror, where's my friend?
I went out on the town
And I ain't seen him since
Hey-ey, where ya been?
Hey-ey, where ya been?
