Song Name: Country Must Be Country Wide
Go ahead and crank this on up
Mmmhmmm
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasin' up the other day
An ol' boy pulled up with a license plate from Ohio I thought oh good Lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
And it ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back, to anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe
Yeah we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And ol' Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide (yeah)
(Get on it ya'll)
In every state
There's a station
C'mon
Y'all better crank this up
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind (doubt in my mind)
Naw, there ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
Amen
