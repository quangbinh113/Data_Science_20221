Song Name: Us Someday
"I do", with a ring on your hand
Raise a toast with some cheap champagne
Tears fall from your daddy on your first dance
Couple cans on a Chevrolet
Right now feels like forever
Like it's a million miles away
But I can see us together
My love, that'll be us someday
Couple kids runnin' wild in the backyard
Handprints in a new driveway
Road trips in a packed-out old car
Little League on a Saturday
You call me crazy dreaming
But I'm gonna dream away
Close my eyes and I swear I see you
My love, that'll be us someday
That'll be us someday!
Oh, you can't control the way life's gonna go
If there's one thing that I know
Is you and me in an old rockin' chair
You're still pretty and I'm turnin' gray
Thinkin' back on the memories we shared
Thinkin' 'bout what you used to say
Boy, you're a crazy dreamer
But I knew in that moment, babe
Our love would just grow deeper
My love, that'll be us someday
I knew back then, that would be us someday
That would be us someday!
That would be us someday
