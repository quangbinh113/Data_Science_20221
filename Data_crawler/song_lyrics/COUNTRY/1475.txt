Song Name: Picture Frames
Remember that summer night in New Orleans?
We'd only known each other for a couple weeks
We watched the sunrise on Bourbon Street
With Hurricanes in our hands
There's something sweet about a morning buzz
When you're dancing with the possibility of love
There wasn't no one but the two of us
That even gave it half a chance
Where do the years go?
These tiny little windows
Hanging on a hallway wall we walk by every day
Damn, time flies outside these picture frames
There we are on Sunset Boulevard
Looking like a couple young movie stars
This one's my favorite, just you on the beach
Smiling at the camera in the Florida Keys
Where do the years go?
These tiny little windows
Hanging on a hallway wall we walk by every day
Damn, time flies outside these picture frames
We still got a little space
Some memories left to make
Baby, just pick a place
We can bring 'em back home
Where do the years go?
These tiny little windows
Hanging on a hallway wall we walk by every day
Damn, time flies outside these picture frames
Damn, time flies outside these picture frames
Oh, these picture frames
