Song Name: I Don't Dance
I'll never settle down
That's what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
I don't dance, but here I am
Spinnin' you 'round and 'round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause I don't dance
Love's never come my way
I've never been this far
'Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No, I don't dance, but here I am
Spinnin' you 'round and 'round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand girl
'Cause, I don't dance
Oooh. I don't dance. Oou oou oou oou
I don't dance, but here I am
Spinnin' you 'round and 'round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
But I'd do anything with you anywhere
Oh I don't dance, but here I am
Spinnin' you 'round and around in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
'Cause, I don't dance
Ou. No. Whoou oou oou ou
