Song Name: She's Country
You boys ever met a real country girl?
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods
Down home country
She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all-nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamma-jamma from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swingin' walk, brother she's all
Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Brother she's country
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from a holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk
Brother she's all
Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
She's country
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country
(Thick Southern drawl)
(Sexy swingin' walk)
Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time, now
Brother she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
She's country
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a home-grown, down to the bone
She's country
