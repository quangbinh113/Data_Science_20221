Song Name: What A Song Can Do - Stripped Down
Makes you wanna take a Sunday drive
Throws you right back to a different time
Puts your lighter up
Singing loud and out of tune
It puts a little sound in an empty space
And for a little while, lets you drift away
It's simple, but it's true
Yeah, it's crazy what a song can do
It can make you dance and make you cry
Make you wanna give it one more try
Start a band and kiss that girl
And break some rules
It'll make you give your heart and get it back
Change your mind just like that
When it's like every single line was written just for you
Ain't it crazy what a song can do?
Makes you make a call at 4 a.m.
Makеs you say you want him all over again
It's like you knew it all along
Ain't it crazy that a song
Can makе you dance and make you cry
Make you wanna give it one more try
Start a band and kiss that girl
And break some rules
It'll make you give your heart and get it back
Change your mind just like that
When it's like every single line was written just for you
Ain't it crazy what a song can do?
Woah, crazy what a song can do
Shake the ground, steal your breath
Feel that pounding in your chest
Bring you to your knees right there in that old church pew
Ooh, make you give your heart and get it back
Change your mind just like that
And most of all it's what brought me here to you
Ain't it crazy what a song (crazy what a song)
Crazy what a song can do?
(Ooh) crazy what a song can do
Crazy what a song can do
