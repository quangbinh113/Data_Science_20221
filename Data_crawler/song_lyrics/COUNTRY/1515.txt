Song Name: I'm Not Alright
And I'm thinking 'bout where you are
Thinkin' never got me far with a whisky glass half empty
And I'm lit all through my mind, singin' just to make you smile
So you'll miss me, and maybe miss me
And I don't wanna change or stay the same
I wanna let you go, I wanna make you stay
I wanna sing along and I wanna hold my tongue
What I'm trying to say
Is baby, I'm not alright, but I'm okay
And I order them nice and strong
Floating just like a star through the neon light I lean on
'Cause I'm drinking myself asleep
Every other night of the week, 'til I see ya
And maybe dream ya
And I don't wanna change or stay the same
I wanna let you go, I wanna make you stay
I wanna sing along and I wanna hold my tongue
What I'm trying to say
Is baby, I'm not alright, but I'm okay
Where'd you go? I wanna find ya, wanna hold ya, wanna know
Where did you go?
Where'd you go? I wanna find ya, wanna hold ya, wanna know
Oh, where did you go?
And I don't wanna change or stay the same
I wanna let you go, I wanna make you stay
I wanna sing along and I wanna hold my tongue
What I'm trying to say
Is baby, I'm not alright, but I'm okay
Ya baby, I'm not alright, but I'm okay
