Song Name: Winning
Parking lot, tailgate, 6 pack
You had my old Atlanta ball cap flipped back
Saturday night game, scored a couple cheap seats
Underneath the delta sign
We were drinking overpriced Miller Light beer cans
From the yelling getcha cold beer here man
And you were looking that way, so watching them boys play
Wasn't even on my mind
You shined brighter than them stadium lights
I was falling, all caught up in your eyes
That Chipper Jones jersey hanging off your shoulder
Had me the best seat in the house
Couldn't care about the score, didn't matter to me
Cause you're the only thing that I wanted to see
We were getting blown out, bottom of the 3rd inning, yup
The Braves were losing, but I was winning
I was hoping, I was praying for a kiss cam
But you kissed me anyway baby I can't
Even remember anything after
Only thing on my mind was
You shined brighter than them stadium lights
I was falling, all caught up in your eyes
That Chipper Jones jersey hanging off your shoulder
Had me the best seat in the house
Couldn't care about the score, didn't matter to me
Cause you're the only thing that I wanted to see
We were getting blown out, bottom of the 5th inning, yup
The Braves were losing, but I was winning
But I was winning
We coulda left in the middle of the 7th
But I was heaven, yeah I was heaven
You shined brighter than them stadium lights
I was falling, all caught up in your eyes
That Chipper Jones jersey hanging off your shoulder
Had me the best seat in the house
Couldn't care about the score, didn't matter to me
Cause you're the only thing that I wanted to see
We were getting blown out, bottom of the 9th inning, yup
The Braves were losing, but I was winning
But I was winning
