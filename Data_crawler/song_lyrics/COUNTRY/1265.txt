Song Name: Like It Ain't - Stripped
Coffee cup on the counter where you left it
Lipstick from the kiss that you left with
Too much of a mess to mess with
Word goin' 'round town
I heard you got a new guy in no time
That's fine, but baby, tonight
Tell it like it ain't true
Tell me that he don't have his hands all over you
Tell it like it ain't through
Tell me that you lay awake thinkin' 'bout me and you
Even though we know it's over and it's way too late
Tell it like it ain't
Ray-Bans on the dash where your bare feet
Used to kick way back in the front seat
Only think about it every othеr memory
I know it's gonna get bettеr, but baby, in the meantime
Be kind if you don't mind
A little white lie
Tell it like it ain't true
Tell me that he don't have his hands all over you
Tell it like it ain't through
Tell me that you lay awake thinkin' 'bout me and you
Even though we know it's over and it's way too late
Tell it like it ain't
Tell me it ain't nothin' but a temporary thing
You just needed your space
Tell me that he ain't nothin' but a friend
Go on and lie to my face
(Tell it like it ain't)
Tell it like it ain't true
Tell me that he don't have his hands all over you
Tell it like it ain't through
Tell me that you lay awake thinkin' 'bout me and you
Even though we know it's over and it's way too late, oh
Tell it like it ain't
Woah-oh, tell it like it ain't
