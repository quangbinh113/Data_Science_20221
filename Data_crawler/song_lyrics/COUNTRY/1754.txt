Song Name: Just the Way
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
Tell 'em, Blanc
The way your hair's in a mess
In the orning when you open your eyes
The way an hour goes by when you say
That you'll be ready in five
(Yeah, uh)
The little dimple on the side of your smile
When you're laughing at a movie
That you've seen about a thousand times
You know girl, that I can't lie
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
Yeah, the flush in your cheeks when you're mad
But you say that you're not (yeah)
And the shape of the face that you make
When you're taking a shot (taking a shot)
The little white lie that you told the security guard
At the hotel pool when we got caught
Yeah, I was thinking girl, you never looked so hot
(You never looked so hot)
And that I love you just the way God made you
Girl, He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
Girl, I ain't ever gon' try to change ya (come on)
My masterpiece, My Mona Lisa and I need ya
To stay just the way God made ya
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
Just the way God made ya
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
