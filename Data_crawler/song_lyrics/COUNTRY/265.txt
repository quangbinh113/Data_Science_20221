Song Name: Highway Don't Care
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're goin' way too fast
You're tryin' not to think about what went wrong
Tryin' not to stop 'til you get where you're goin'
You're tryin' to stay awake, so I bet you turned on the radio
And the song goes
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're comin' home
But I do, I do
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bendin' God's ear talkin' 'bout me
You're tryin' not to let the first tear fall down
You're tryin' not to think about turnin' around
You're tryin' not to get lost in the sound, but that song is always on
So you sing along
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're comin' home
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
But I do, I do
(The highway don't care)
I can't live without you, baby, baby
(The highway don't care)
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
But I do, I do
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, baby
But I do, I do
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
(The highway don't care)
I can't live without you, baby, baby
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
