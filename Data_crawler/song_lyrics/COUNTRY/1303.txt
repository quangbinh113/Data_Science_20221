Song Name: Last Cigarette - Acoustic
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Tell me the truth, is it over for you?
It isn't for me, but I'll say what you want me to say
Addiction is strong, and I know it's wrong
But I need that high, I ain't gonna lie
Give me tonight, so I can be alright
I can hold your body and you can hold mine
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I want you one last time
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to be over yet
Won't you be my last cigarette?
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I thought it took three times to burn into my mind
But I had you once and you threw a punch
But I'm not too mad
All the fun that we had
But it's hard to let go
It's so hard to say no
I can't go all day
My hands, they shake
I've gone off the deep side
Habits gonna make me die
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I want you one last time
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to be over yet
Won't you be my last cigarette?
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
So, you want better now
So, you gotta lay me down
But don't go, not yet
Wanna wake up with you on my breath
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I want you one last time
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to be over yet
Won't you be my last cigarette?
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Cigarette
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
