Song Name: Damn Good Life
Yeah, I woke up and I'm still breathing
Got more than I'm ever gonna need
Took time out today to thank Jesus
Man, I got a damn good, damn good life
I got a house, it ain't no mansion
No shop but got a few wrenches
Got a truck, it ain't no Maybach
But the seats in the front go way back
The grass may be greener on the other side
At the end of the day, we'll be alright
I do what I love, got more than enough
Of the good stuff to be just fine
'Cause I woke up and I'm still breathing
Got more than I'm ever gonna need
Took time out today to thank Jesus
Man, I got a damn good, damn good
Dog in the yard, some cash on my card
New strings on this old guitar
I come home to damn good wife
Man, I got a damn good, damn good life
I got a job, but I ain't rich
I'm in a town that ain't too big
I don't know if it's how the good Lord planned it
But I ain't gonna take it for granted
Yeah, I woke up and I'm still breathing
Got more than I'm ever gonna need
Took time out today to thank Jesus
Man, I got a damn good, damn good
Dog in the yard, some cash on my card
New strings on this old guitar
I come home to damn good wife
Man I got a damn good, damn good life
And I ain't got everything
But everything ain't everything
Yeah, I woke up and I'm still breathing
Got more than I'm ever gonna need
Took time out today to thank Jesus
Man, I got a damn good, damn good
Dog in the yard, some cash on my card
New strings on this old guitar
I come home to damn good wife
Man, I got a damn good, damn good life
Yeah, I woke up and I'm still breathing
Got more than I'm ever gonna need (a damn good life)
Took time out today to thank Jesus
Man, I got a damn good, damn good
Dog in the yard, some cash on my card
New strings on this old guitar (damn good life)
I come home to damn good wife
Man, I got a damn good, damn good life (a damn good life)
