Song Name: Rain All Summer
Grey skies, blue eyes
California red wine lips on mine
Three days, straight rain
Forecast saying more of the same
Laying here watching them clouds roll in
And I don't mind one bit
Baby, it could rain all summer
On the roof of this house all night all day
All over each other
Don't waste one drop, girl drop them shades
Who cares if the sun ain't shining
Let it storm, let it pour, I don't mind
If it keeps you and me tangled up in these sheets we're under
Baby, it could rain all summer
If I don't see one beach
For three months that's cool with me
You can keep that two-piece in the drawer
And that sundress on the floor
Baby, it could rain all summer
On the roof of this house all night all day
All over each other
Don't waste one drop, girl drop them shades
Who cares if the sun ain't shining
Let it storm, let it pour, I don't mind
If it keeps you and me tangled up in these sheets we're under
Baby, it could rain all summer
Rain, rain don't go away
Keep tap tapping that windowpane
Rain, rain don't go away
Leave leaving this room for another day
Baby, it could rain all summer
On the roof of this house all night all day
All over each other
Don't waste one drop, girl drop them shades
Who cares if the sun ain't shining
Let it storm, let it pour, I don't mind
If it keeps you and me tangled up in these sheets we're under
Baby, it could rain all summer
I don't mind if it rains all summer
