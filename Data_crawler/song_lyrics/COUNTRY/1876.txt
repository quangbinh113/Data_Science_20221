Song Name: All Night
Woo
I got the good, if you've got the time
I got the moon, if you've got the shine
I got the back, if you've got the beat
Got the solid-gold country 33 on repeat
All night
Get, get, get to livin', feeling alright
Dancin' out the denim in, uh, oh my, Levis
I got the fuse, if you've got the light
I got the all, if y'all got the night
All night
All night
Woo
I got the rebel, if you've got the yell (hey)
I got the raisin', if you've got the hell
I got the zig (I got the zig), you've got the zag
Got that good life, hell of a time in the bag
All night
Get, get, get to livin' feeling alright
Dancin' out the denim in, uh, oh my, Levis
I got the fuse, if you've got the light
I got the all, if y'all got the night
All night
What good is a saint if you ain't got the sinnin'?
What good is a life if you don't get to livin'?
What good is a one if you ain't got the other?
Takes two to tango, let's get this thing goin'
All night
Get, get, get to livin' feeling alright
Dancin' out the denim in, uh, oh my, Levis
I got the fuse, if you've got the light
I got the all, if y'all got the night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
