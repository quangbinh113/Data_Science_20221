Song Name: Good Life
I've been hypnotized by a Gypsy Lover
Been sucker punched hard by a redneck mother
Been plagiarized by my own damn brother
Hey man, I think that's my line
I've been crucified by a Baptist preacher
Been face to face with the ol' Grim Reaper
Been taken to school by a long-legged teacher
Miss you Miss Jones
I've made a pile a cash, but I ain't quite saved it
Been six months late on a new truck payment
Down to pickin' up smokes off the dirty ass ground
Got a light?
I'm livin' me a good life
I wouldn't change it if I could, life
I might tell you that I'll see you on down the road
But I'll never tell ya goodbye
I know I'm always right there
South Georgia in my mommas prayers
I'm still keeping her awake at night
But I'm livin' me a good, good, good, good, good life
I've been up all night drinking Irish Whiskey
With a reggae girl down in Mississippi
She stole my heart first time she kissed me
Man, she don't miss me
I'm livin' me a good life
I wouldn't change it if I could, life
I might tell you that I'll see you on down the road
But I'll never tell ya goodbye
I know I'm always right there, right there
All up in my mommas prayers
I'm still keeping her awake at night
But I'm livin' me a good, good, good, good, good life, good life
I've been floatin' free
I've been big sky high
I've been takin' my time
I'm livin' me a good life
I wouldn't change it if I could, life
I might tell you that I'll see you on down the road
But I'll never tell ya goodbye
I know I'm always right there, right there
All up in my mommas prayers
I'm still keeping her awake at night
Yeah, I'm livin' me a good, good, good, good, good life
I'm livin' me a good, good, good, good, good life
A good, good, good, good, good life
