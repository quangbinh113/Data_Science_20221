Song Name: Take It Slow
You came down your stairs with that sundress and those Chuck Taylor's on
Then your pops said, "Don't keep me up all night long"
We pulled out your drive, about the time that sky went pink
I said, "Baby, what d'ya think?"
And you said, "Take it slow, I know a back road, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio"
'Cause you said that you were all mine
Innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night
And let's just take it slow
You said, "We got nowhere to be, nowhere to go
So let's just take it slow"
I parked that Chevrolet in that field where those daisies grow
Put one in your hair, said, "Don't you dare ever let me go"
And I just wanna hold you 'til that sun comes back
And I just wanna know you like nobody ever has
And you said, "Take it slow, I know a back road, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio"
'Cause you said that you were all mine
Innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night
And let's just take it slow, slow
Nowhere to be, nowhere to go
Don't wanna leave, can't take you home
Let's just take it slow, I know a back road, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio
'Cause you said that you were all mine
Innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night
And let's just take it slow
You said, "We got nowhere to be, nowhere to go
So let's just take it slow"
Yeah, let's just take it slow
