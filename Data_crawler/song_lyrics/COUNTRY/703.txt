Song Name: I Hope Youâ€™re Happy Now
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said I don't love you
A little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a good-bye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
I hope you find, what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you keep moving on
I figured it out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope, you're happy now
Who knew this heart could break
This hard
Or love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted
Well I guess you found, what you
Were looking for
I guess my heart, ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope, you're happy now
I hope you found, what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you been moving on
All figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope, you're happy now
Happy now
Oh I hope you're happy now
