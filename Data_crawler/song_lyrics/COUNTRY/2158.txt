Song Name: Love Talking
Girl, I swear I never
Use words like forever
Can't believe that ever came out of my mouth, oh
Felt like I was dreaming
But when you started leaving
My heart started thinking out loud and now I
Keep replaying in my mind
What went down last night
Did I overstep the line we've been walking?
Swear I wasn't even drunk
So if I said too much
Oh, that was just the love talking
When I said you're the only one
I'm ever gonna need, ever gonna want
Don't know what came over me, that was just the love
When I let it slip that I
Wanted you for my whole life
And you and me turned into us, that was just the love talking
Talking
Talking, talking, talking
I got no excuses
Plain and honest truth is
I've been holding on to this for a long, long time
Still hungover
Never been more sober
Can't blame a liquor buzz
No, that was just the love
When I said you're the only one
I'm ever gonna need, ever gonna want
Don't know what came over me, that was just the love
When I let it slip that I
Wanted you for my whole life
And you and me turned into us, that was just the love talking
Talking, yeah
Keep replaying in my mind
What went down last night
And all that love
When I said you're the only one
I'm ever gonna need, ever gonna want
Don't know what came over me, that was just the love
When I let it slip that I
Wanted you for my whole life
And you and me turned into us, that was just the love talking (talking, talking, talking)
Ooh, talking (talking, talking, talking)
Oh, that was just the love talking
