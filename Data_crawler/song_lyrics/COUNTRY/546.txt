Song Name: Straight Tequila Night
If you really want to know
She comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K-13 is her favourite song
If you play it you might have a chance
Tonight she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly and fun lovin'
Most of the time
But don't ask her
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him
And she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart
On every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Here's a glass of chablis
Some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt
Or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back to see her again
Don't ask her
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him
And she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart
On every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Don't ask her
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him
And she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart
On every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
But don't ask her
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him
And she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart
On every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Don't ask her
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him
And she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart
On every man in sight
On a straight tequila nightï¿¼
