Song Name: Heavy Pour
Yeah, I told you before
And I'll tell you again
This life I live has been forged
And I'm backwards fire
With some hella wind
So, when I walk through that door
Get me a heavy pour
I've had a long damn day
I'm a grown ass man
Don't care about the jukebox
Don't give a damn
Only plan is let the hell out around tonight
I've been down and I've been up
I've been through hell and I've had enough
So, when I walk through that door
Get me a heavy pour
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When I walk through that door
Get me a heavy pour
I've had a long damn day
I'm a grown ass man
Don't care about the jukebox
Don't give a damn
Only plan is let the hell out around tonight
I've been down and I've been up
I've been through hell and I've had enough
So, when I walk through that door
Get me a heavy pour
When I walk through that door
Get me a heavy pour
