Song Name: You Look Good in Neon
I've been sitting here drinking
My standards are sinking again
I've been watching you watching me all night
But I ain't worried 'bout the shape that you're in
I know I'll probably never see you again
And I ain't ever gonna tell my friends about you
But you look good in neon
You gave me your last cigarette
And when it's closing time and the lights come on
We should share a shot of Fernet
And if you wanna slow dance
Well this is your last chance
To prove me right and do me wrong
You look good in neon
Girl, you got me rolling
I've never heard that one before
I admit that I feel alright tonight
But don't you worry 'bout the shape that I'm in
You don't ever have to see me again
And I ain't ever gonna tell my friends about you
'Cause you look good in neon
You gave me your last cigarette
And when it's closing time and the lights come on
We should share a shot of Fernet
And if you wanna slow dance
This is your last chance
To prove me right and do me wrong
You look good in neon
And out here on the floor
I don't ever want this night to end
You make it look so good
That I don't need to pretend
That you look good in neon
You gave me your last cigarette
And when it's closing time and the lights come on
We should share this shot of Fernet
And if you wanna slow dance
Well this is your last chance
To prove me right and do me wrong
You look good in neon
