Song Name: Minimum Wage
Yeah, I met you 'fore anybody knew my name
Playing for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an All-Star Special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was crying when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401K, but hey, I had you
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you, lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' with the Joneses
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you looking at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Girl, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
