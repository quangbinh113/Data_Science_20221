Song Name: Pickup
Saw a '95 F150 at a stoplight
Looked a lot like yours
But it didn't have that learn-to-drive stick shift dent
That I put in the door
Or that Sunshine State sticker on the gate
We'd got in a spring break town
Damn, it's been a minute since I've been in it
Now I'm thinkin' bout
Whose hand's out the window
When the window's down? (Ain't me, ain't me no more)
Who's turning up the radio way too loud? (I did when I was yours)
Who's beer bottle buzzin' on that bench seat
Got you parking lot parking like you're seventeen
Whose new perfume is fading mine out?
Who's that pickup picking up now?
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup (who's that pickup picking up now?)
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup picking up now?
Do you keep a hoodie in the backsеat
Like you did for me, in case shе gets cold?
Is my cherry lip gloss still there in your glove box?
Wonder if she knows that I was her that summer
Laid back in your shotgun seat
Ain't gonna lie, yeah, sometimes
I still wish it was me
Whose hand's out the window
When the window's down? (Ain't me, ain't me no more)
Who's turning up the radio way too loud? (I did when I was yours)
Who's beer bottle buzzin' on that bench seat?
Got you parking lot parking like you're seventeen
Whose new perfume is fading mine out?
Who's that pickup picking up now?
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup (who's that pickup picking up now?)
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup picking up now?
Who's picking up the phone on a Friday night
When you call saying, "Babe, be ready in five"
When you pull in the drive, who's climbing inside?
Making memories with you that could've been mine
Whose hand's out the window when the window's down?
Who's turning up the radio way too loud? Oh-oh
Who's beer bottle buzzin' on that bench seat
Got you parking lot parking like you're seventeen
Whose new perfume is fading by now?
Who's that pickup picking up now?
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup (who's that pickup picking up now?)
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup picking up now? (Who's that pickup picking up now?)
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup (who's that pickup picking up now?)
Who's that pickup picking up now? Yeah
Who's that pickup picking up now?
