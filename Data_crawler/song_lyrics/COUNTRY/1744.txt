Song Name: Boot Scootin' Boogie
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Where there's a honky tonk near the County line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey women, music, and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time, I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide a way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie
Yeah, heel toe, docie doe, come on, baby, let's go, boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, Black Jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh, get down turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
The bartender asks me, say, "Son what'll it be"
I want a shot at that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floors hoppin', and it's hotter than the Fourth of July
I see outlaws inlaws crooks and straights
All out makin' it shake doin' the boot scootin' boogie
Yeah, heel toe docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, Black Jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Get down turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
Oh, heel toe docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Yeah, Cadillac, Black Jack baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Yeah, get down turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
I say get down turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
Oh, get down turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
