Song Name: Free and Clean - DBPC
Don't you think you've done enough?
Been living awful rough
It seems like I don't want to get better
Time to strike out on my own
Wait for a reason to come back home
It stings 'cause I thought we'd go together
I guess I'd had this coming for a while
Just never thought this would be your style
So I'll go back to living free and clean
Somewhere in between who I was
And who you wanted me to be
Now I know exactly what they mean
When they say chasing dreams ain't as easy all alone
Mama says you're out of line
Daddy said that I'll be fine
And I, I ain't said much of nothing
Got too much left to do
I'll ruin me and you ruin you
And we will see who really becomes something
I guess I've had it coming for awhile
Just never thought this would be your style
So I'll go back to living free and clean
Somewhere in between who I was
And who you wanted me to be
Now I know exactly what they mean
When they say chasing dreams ain't as easy all alone
