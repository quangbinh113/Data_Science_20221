Song Name: Don't Do It In Texas
Hmm, hmm
I can see it in your eyes
Know what's on your mind
I can read between the lines
This love ain't gonna fly
So, go on break my heart
Baby, tear it all apart
Some things you just don't mess with
My only request is
Just don't do it in Texas
Don't do me that wrong
Don't wanna end up an ex in
Some old George Strait song
Yeah, just remember
Everything's bigger
And I couldn't handle a hurt that size
So, don't do it in Texas
If you're saying goodbye
Yeah, I could take the pain
Out in Santa Fe
I could watch you walk away
In an Oklahoma rain
I could handle if it happened
Way up high in Aspen
Or a dive bar in Detroit
But boy, that ain't the point
Just don't do it in Texas
Don't do me that wrong
Don't wanna end up an ex in
Some old George Strait song
Yeah, just remember
Everything's bigger
And I couldn't handle a hurt that size
So, don't do it in Texas
If you're saying goodbye
Just don't do it, baby, just don't do it
Just don't do it, baby, just don't do it
Just don't do it in Texas, naw
Don't take it that far
Well, if you're leaving me lonely
Leave me that lone star
Yeah, just remember
Everything's bigger
And I couldn't handle a hurt that size
So, don't do it in Texas
No, if you're saying goodbye
Just don't do it, baby, just don't do it
Just don't do it, baby, just don't do it
If you're leaving me lonely, baby
Just don't do it in Texas
