Song Name: Heartland - Pure Country/Soundtrack Version
When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar
You're listenin' to the sound of the American heart
And opry music on a Saturday night
Brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye
Sing a song about the Heartland
The only place I feel at home
Sing about the way a good man
Works until the daylight's gone
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
Where they still know wrong from right
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about my life
Sing a song about the Heartland
The only place I feel at home
Sing about the way a good man
Works until the daylight's gone
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
Where they still know wrong from right
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about my life
He-yey
