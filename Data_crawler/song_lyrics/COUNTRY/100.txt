Song Name: I Like It, I Love It
Spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
My mama and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me
And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights
