Song Name: What Part of No
Sir, if you don't mind I'd rather be alone
From the moment I walked in tonight
You've been comin' on
If I've told you once, I've told you twice
I'm just here to unwind
I'm not interested in romance
Or what you have in mind
What part of no don't you understand?
To put it plain and simpl
I'm not into one night stands
I'll be glad to explain it
If it's too hard to comprehend
What part of no don't you understand?
I appreciate the drink and the rose
Was nice of you
I don't mean to be so mean
I don't think I'm gettin' through
I don't need no company
And I don't wanna dance
So what part of no don't you understand?
What part of no don't you understand?
To put it plain and simpl
I'm not into one night stands
I'll be glad to explain it
If it's too hard to comprehend
What part of no don't you understand?
I'll be glad to explain it
If it's too hard to comprehend
What part of no don't you understand?
What part of no don't you understand?
