Song Name: Tell You Everything - Not Put Together
Usually I hate every guy that I meet
There's something 'bout the way you look at me
Usually I keep all my thoughts to myself
But you're the first one I wanna tell
All the drama with my mama, things I can't tell my friends
When I tell you, you don't look at me different
And I wanna tell you everything, every little detail
How I got the scar above my left eye from a kid in middle school
When I wrote my first song, how I got my heart broke
By some guy I wish I never met, he gave me my first smoke
All the secrets I've been keeping, my prayers and my sins
I wanna tell you everything
Yeah, things seem so much more clear to me now
'Cause you let me talk it all out
I don't know how I lived life before you
You see all my ugly and love me for the truth
All my drunk texts, my regrets, nights I wanna forget
You know them and you don't look at me different
And I wanna tell you everything, every little detail
How I got the scar above my left eye from a kid in middle school
When I wrote my first song, how I got my heart broke
By some guy I wish I never met, he gave me my first smoke
All the secrets I've been keeping, my prayers and my sins
I wanna tell you everything
If I get a record deal, speeding ticket
Double-wide trailer, a house with a picket
Life gets hard, I'm the first to admit it
In some weird way, I think that you get it
When I tell you everything, every little detail
How I got the scar above my left eye from a kid in middle school
When I wrote my first song, how I got my heart broke
By some guy I wish I never met, he gave me my first smoke
All the secrets I've been keeping, my prayers and my sins
I'll tell you the whole story, beginning to end
I wanna tell you everything
I'll tell you everything
