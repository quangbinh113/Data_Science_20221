Song Name: WHAT I HAVE
My neighbor's grass is the hit of the street
But that don't mean mine ain't just as green
I've been comparing shiny new toys
It's just the root of the thief of my joy
I know, that's just the pony show
'Cause I got a roof over my head
I got a warm body in bed
I'm doin' alright, right where I'm at
With what I have
I bought the shoes where the bottom is red
But who the hell am I tryin' to impress?
When you sit back, that's when you notice
The Joneses can't even keep up with the Joneses
I know, don't gotta shine to be gold
'Cause I got a roof over my head
I got a warm body in bed
I'm doing alright, right where I'm at
With what I have
I got a Jeep, I got a dog
I got what they call a dream job
Plenty to want, nothing wrong with that
But I'm happy with what I have
Mmm, ah
I got the air, good eyes to see
Got so much more than I'll ever need
Even the bad days ain't all that bad
With what I have
I'm doin' alright, right where I'm at
With what I have
