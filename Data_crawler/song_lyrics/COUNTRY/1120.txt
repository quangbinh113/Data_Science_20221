Song Name: Prayin' In A Deer Stand
I think I read somewhere in the Good Book
Says He's everywhere
Up in this tree with the wind and the leaves
Yeah, it all seems so clear
When your phone's in the truck and you're camo'd up
And your mind's just runnin' free
It might look like hunting
But it's way more than that to me
I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Some find it on a pier where they used to fish with their old man
Some feel it when the choir sings and that light hits that stained glass
We're all down here searchin' for or an answer or a sign
The way those clouds are movin' in, I think He's hearin' me just fine
I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand
My boots back on the ground
My head back right
You got your ways of gettin' through
I got mine
I do my prayin' in a deer stand
Out on my back forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand
