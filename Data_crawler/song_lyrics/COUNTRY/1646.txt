Song Name: Can Chaser
She'll ride that Appaloosa
In head to toe rhinestones
Roughie or a roper
Never you mind who she takes home
She's no buckle bunny
She's got some of her own
Clover leafin' woman
You call her backyard grown
She's a can chaser, barrel racer
Queen of the rodeo
She's a can chaser, you can't chase her
Love to see her go
Talk about her clipped in hair
False lashes and lipstick
Joke how she must be sore down there
You say she gets her pick
Go ahead and rope that steer
Like men were built to do
While she breaks away you'll break a leg
She'll run circles around you
She's a can chaser, barrel racer
Queen of the rodeo
She's a can chaser, you can't chase her
Love to see her go
She's a can chaser, barrel racer
Queen of the rodeo
She's a can chaser, you can't chase her
Love to see her go
She's a can chaser, barrel racer
Queen of the rodeo
She's a can chaser, you can't chase her
Love to see her go
