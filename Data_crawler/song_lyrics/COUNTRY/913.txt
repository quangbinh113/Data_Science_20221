Song Name: A Holly Jolly Christmas
Ding-dong-ding
Ding-dong-ding
Have a holly jolly Christmas (ding-dong-ding)
It's the best time of the year (ding-dong-ding)
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas (ding-dong-ding)
And when you walk down the street (ding-dong-ding)
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas (ding-dong-ding)
And in case you didn't hear (ding-dong-ding)
Oh, by golly
Have a holly jolly Christmas this year
(Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year)
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas (ding-dong-ding)
And in case you didn't hear (ding-dong-ding)
Oh, by golly
Have a holly jolly Christmas this year
Ding-dong-ding-dong
Ding-dong-ding-dong
Ding-dong-ding-dong
