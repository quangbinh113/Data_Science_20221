Song Name: Rhinestone Ring
When I was a little girl
I wanted a white dress and a veil
Wearing a string of pearls
When I was a little girl, oh
Something borrowed and blue
Something old, something new
But that all changed when I met you, oh
I'd promise you forever right here, right now
With a rhinestone ring and a little black dress
Under neon lights, baby, I'd say yes
Don't need no church, just a barstool aisle
'Cause it just feels right
Raise a whiskey glass, no, I wouldn't think twice
Having our first dance to a jukebox choir
Baby, I don't care, wear your old blue jeans
Yeah, I'd marry you right now with a rhinestone ring
Oh, they say that love
It makes you do crazy things
Baby, I know it does
'Cause when it comes to you and me, oh
Church bells would be nice, but baby, not yet
All I really need
Is a rhinestone ring and a little black dress
Under neon lights, baby, I'd say yes
Don't need no church, just a barstool aisle
'Cause it just feels right
Raise a whiskey glass, no, I wouldn't think twice
Having our first dance to a jukebox choir
Baby, I don't care, wear your old blue jeans
Yeah, I'd marry you right now with a rhinestone ring
With a rhinestone ring
Oh, something borrowed and blue
Something old, something new
But that all changed when I met you, oh
I'd promise you forever right here, right now
With a rhinestone ring and a little black dress
Under neon lights, baby, I'd say yes
Don't need no church, just a barstool aisle
'Cause it just feels right
Raise a whiskey glass, no, I wouldn't think twice
Having our first dance to a jukebox choir
Baby, I don't care, wear your old blue jeans
Yeah, I'd marry you right now with a rhinestone ring
Yeah, I'd marry you right now
Yeah, I'd marry you right now with a rhinestone ring
