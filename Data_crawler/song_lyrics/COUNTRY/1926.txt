Song Name: Zero Trucks
I heard word on the dirt road
She's ridin' shotgun
Thought it would, but it don't hurt though
Now you're her problem
I ain't gonna chase your taillights
I ain't gonna miss your speakers
I ain't gonna waste one more night
Sleepin' in your t-shirt
Go ahead, take a spin with your new girlfriend
With the windows down
Take her out to the same spot we got stuck
Kiss her back in the bed
Lookin' up at a million stars around
I'll be in the club gettin' low
With my friends on the floor, ayy
Givin' zero trucks (da-da-da, da-da-da)
Givin' zero trucks (da-da-da, da-da-da) (alright)
I hope y'all have fun
My good time's overdue
No babe, I ain't drunk
I'm sober and over you
I ain't about to get all jealous
She can dance in your headlights
I don't even dread runnin' into y'all
At them small town red lights
Go ahead, take a spin with your new girlfriend
With the windows down
Take her out to the same spot we got stuck
Kiss her back in the bed
Lookin' up at a million stars around
I'll be in the club gettin' low
With my friends on the floor, ayy
Givin' zero trucks
Givin' zero trucks
I ain't lookin' in my rearview
I ain't gonna miss your liftgate
If you miss my tailgate
Well, baby, you can kiss it
Go ahead, take a spin with your new girlfriend
With the windows down
Take her out to the same spot we got stuck, mm
Kiss her back in the bed
Lookin' up at a million stars around
I'll be in the club gettin' low
With my friends on the floor, ayy
Givin' zero trucks (listen, I really don't care)
Givin' zero trucks
Yeah-yeah, baby, I give zero trucks
