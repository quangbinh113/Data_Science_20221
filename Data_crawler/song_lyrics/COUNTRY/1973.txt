Song Name: Where We Started
I'd come through, round two
And pick you up right after your shift
Drive that Chevrolet like a getaway
You'd be counting your tips
Windows down and screaming, I will wait for us
Everybody, just wait for us
Yeah, we're coming, just wait for us
Those days when you're brokenhearted
And you're getting knocked down and you're saying
Don't know how far we're gonna go, just
Look at that road and think about where we started
Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap
We're all we need, yeah
Darling, I know how far we're gonna go just
Look at that road and think about where we started
I've been playing my guitar, singing
Them covers in an empty room (covers in an empty room)
You know one day I would make a
Living outta singing 'bout you (living outta singing 'bout you)
Windows down and screaming, I will wait for us
Everybody, just wait for us
Yeah, we're coming, just wait for us
Those days when you're brokenhearted
And you're getting knocked down and you're saying
Don't know how far we're gonna go just
Look at that road and think about where we started
Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap
We're all we need, yeah
Darling, I know how far we're gonna go just
Look at that road and think about where we started
And how far we're gonna go
And all the things we're gonna see
If you wonder 'bout our future
Think about our history
Those days when you're brokenhearted
And you're getting knocked down and you're saying
Don't know (don't know) how far we're gonna go, just
Look at that road (that road) and think about where we started
Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap
We're all we need, yeah
Darling, I know how far we're gonna go just
Look at that road and think about where we started
Mhmm, oh, whoa
Where we started
