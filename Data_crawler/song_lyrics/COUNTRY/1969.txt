Song Name: Good Riddance
Ooh
Nana, nana, nana
Yeah, yeah
I was getting kinda sad, drunk there on the couch
I was drinking bout my bad luck (Bad luck) and love walking out
When that door swung open and there you stood
My pity party in the corner was through (Hey)
Good riddance to that lukewarm beer in the kitchen
Good riddance to the sad songs, I don't wanna listen
Yeah, thought my heart was broke, but turns out it isn't
When a girl like you walks into a room all you can do is say
Good riddance to the past (To the past now)
And I ain't never lookin' back (Nah, nah, that's right)
My buddy hit me said get your jaw up off the floor
I went right up to you said "Do you wanna chill on the porch?"
You said, "Sure"
Damn girl, that conversation
It caught me off guard, now I'm catching me saying (I'm saying)
Good riddance to that lukewarm beer in the kitchen (Oh, good riddance)
Good riddance to the sad songs, I don't wanna listen
Yeah, thought my heart was broke, but turns out it isn't
When a girl like you walks into a room all you can do is say
Good riddance to the past and all my bad decisions (It's all good, man)
I ain't never looking back
I'm just saying, "Good riddance", yeah
Good riddance
Bye bye
Yeah
Good riddance to that lukewarm beer in the kitchen (Yeah)
Good riddance to the sad songs, I don't wanna listen
Yeah, thought my heart was broke, but turns out it isnt
When a girl like you walks into a room all you can do is say,
"Good riddance"
La-lala-la-la, good riddance
La-lala-la-la, good riddance to the past and all my bad decisions
I ain't never looking back
I'm just saying, "Good riddance", yeah
