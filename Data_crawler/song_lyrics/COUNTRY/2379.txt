Song Name: I Quit Drinking
We used to be
The life of the party
Body to body
Dance the night away
Shoot tequila straight
Obsessed with each other
And down for another
Round until last call
Wasn't alcohol
Keeping us up 'til the sun came around
Thought we'd stay drunk forever, but now
You're the reason there's no whiskey
Anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne
Never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're the reason
I quit drinking
We used to be
Dizzy all morning
Hungover, pouring
Cups of coffee, black
Kiss and crawl right back
Under the covers
Down for another
Hour in the bed
Now I'm here instead
Waking up sober, it feels kinda nice
Except that I can't sleep at night
You're the reason there's no whiskey
Anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne
Never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're the reason
I quit drinking
I quit thinking (I quit thinking)
Staring at the ceiling
Dumped my Cabernets down the kitchen sink and
I quit mixing (I quit mixing)
All my drinks and feelings
It's not fixing that you're gone
You're the reason there's no whiskey
Anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne
Never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're the reason
Oh
You're the reason
I quit drinking
