Song Name: Pretty Ugly
It was Sunday drive blue sky weather
It was two names carved in a heart on a tree
It was him and me thinking it was gonna last forever
It was looking like a real deal diamond ring
Oh I'm talking picture perfect Polaroid put it in a frame
Oh but it's lookin like it's all done changed
Roses on the counter are wilted now
Nail holes where I took the pictures down
Right side nightstand looks a little bit dusty
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Mascara running down a made up face
Clouds rolled in now it always rains
It was beautiful up until he said he didn't love me
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
I'm usually a little more put together
But I can't quit wearing his worn out shirt
Missing him's still sitting front and center
And I can't even hide how bad it hurts
Roses on the counter are wilted now
Nail holes where I took the pictures down
Right side nightstand looks a little bit dusty
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Mascara running down a made up face
Clouds rolled in and now it always rains
It was beautiful up until he said he didn't love me
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Oh I'm talking picture perfect Polaroid put it in a frame
Oh yea it's a damn shame
Roses on the counter are wilted now
Nail holes where I took the pictures down
Right side nightstand looks a little bit dusty
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Mascara running down a made up face
Clouds rolled in and now it always rains
It was beautiful up until he said he didn't love me
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
Heartbreak makes pretty ugly
