Song Name: Dutton Ranch Freestyle
Met a girl downtown at the bar last night and we got to talking
Said, "She likes cheap drinks and tattoos and Morgan Wallen"
She said, "What about you?" I said, "I like late night bonfires
Yellowstone, Whiskey Myers and lifted trucks with mud on the tires"
And I'm back
Feeling like a million bucks, still tryna live it up, live in America
Grew up in the Appalachian mountains, South of the Mason-Dixon in a small town area
Been tryna tell y'all for a minute that I'm here, I ain't going nowhere anytime soon
I'm in my hometown right now with the windows down at the cookout drive through
Pull up, hop out, Walmart, late night
Redbox movie, you, me, date night
This that full moon rising, girl I'm full of surprises
Camo pants with the Air Johns, I'm so stylish
Don't ask me for my opinion, I don't want y'all to get offended
Everybody's just so sensitive, it's crazy it's ruined so many friendships
Okay, I'ma come back later, why would I care about my haters?
All I care about's my friends, my family and my Lord and Saviour
I'm back now on the track now
West Virginia's finally on the map now
I just do my thing, let my guitar sing
Like, ay, ay, ay, ay
Back in this things like I never left, my flow is heaven-sent
I'm eating jerky, it's venison
I am pure excellence, I am the excrement, everybody's in the room, I'm the elephant (ay)
Hopping in my truck, I'm coming, keep that engine running
Just copped me a new chain with Yellowstones, I feel like John Dutton
Y'all boys lame like Jamie, me? I'm more like Kayce
On these tracks I'm Beth (why?), 'cause I go crazy
Yeah, I'm wild and free, got riders with me
They call my boy Rip 'cause when you see him it's RIP
Met a girl downtown at the bar last night and we got to talking
Said, "She likes cheap drinks and tattoos and Morgan Wallen"
She said, "What about you?" I said, "I like late-night bonfires
Yellowstone, Whiskey Myers and lifted trucks with mud on the tires"
And I'm back
"Yellowstone, Whiskey Myers and lifted trucks with mud on the tires"
I'm back
