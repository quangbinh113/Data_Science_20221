Song Name: It'll Work Itself Out
She wakes up in the mornin'
Sleepin' in the bed I made
Bound to get away I'd say
I wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' of her again
Did I ever make her day?
Did I ever make her day?
See I broke my mind in half
Everybody even I know it
And I'll talk to the papers
And I'll drive back south
But it'll probably work itself out
It'll probably work itself out
See you were someone I knew,
Studied your face for years
We know how it might have been
So we made up some story
That we gotta tell sometimes
We don't ever quite get it right
We don't wanna live some lie
So I broke my mind in half
And everybody even I know it
And I'll talk to the papers
And I'll drive back south
But it'll probably work itself out
It'll probably work itself out
And we'll both catch colds come spring
And there ain't no such thing as everything
You got reservations and I got doubts
And it'll probably work itself out
It'll probably work itself out
It'll probably work itself out
It'll probably work itself out
