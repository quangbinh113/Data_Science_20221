Song Name: Russell County Line
And I have traveled such a distance
Just to see the smile that's on your face
And I have traveled far and wide, and I have died
And lived and flown through time and space

And the most familiar happiness
I've ever known is here with me again
Tucked away inside my home
This rolling stone has found a rock to call his friend
And if you wonder where my heart is when I'm out on the road
Lord, it's right at home, I left it honey just for you to hold
And if you wonder how I'm doing, know that I am doing fine
But I wish I was in Virginia on the Russell Country line
Captivated by your beauty, I look at you and see the one I love

Reunited in this tomb where our pride died and is buried from above
And in that dirt was planted seeds of hope
And from them grew the flowers of our lives
And all our favourite little things that true loves brings
All the times we laughed and cried
And if you wonder where my heart is when I'm out on the road
It's right at home, I left it honey, just for you to hold
And if you wonder how I'm doing, know that I am doing fine
But I wish I was in Virginia on the Russell Country line
And if you wonder where my heart is when I'm out on the road
Lord, it's right at home, I left it honey just for you to hold
And if you wonder how I'm doing, know that I am doing fine
But I wish I was in Virginia on the Russell Country line
I wish I was in Virginia on the Russell Country line
