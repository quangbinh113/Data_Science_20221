Song Name: All of These Years
Where have I been all of these years?
I woke up to screams living in the mirror
Where have I been all of these years?
Is red, white, and blue still blood, sweat, and tears?
Where have I been all of these years?
I should've died when I disappeared
Where have I been all of these years?
I realize that clear eyes can't shed a tear
God help us all in our search for truth
Nothing makes you old like holding onto youth
What keeps me young and long in the tooth
Is a lotta blood, a lotta sweat, and little bit of the blues
Where have I been all of these years?
In the Lost and Found, running from the fear
Where have I been all of these years?
I realize I come around when my eyes are clear
God help us all in our search for truth
Nothing makes you old like holding onto youth
What keeps me young and long in the tooth
Is a lotta blood, a lotta sweat, and little bit of the blues
God help us all in our search for truth
Nothing makes you old like holding onto youth
What keeps me young and long in the tooth
Is a lotta blood, a lotta sweat, and little bit of the blues
