Song Name: Why Don't We Just Dance
Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothin' but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty livin' room ain't gonna look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beatin'
Nobody's gonna see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
And those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already drivin' me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug
Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
(Bouncin' off the wall)
(Floatin' on air)
Oh baby, baby, why don't we just dance?
