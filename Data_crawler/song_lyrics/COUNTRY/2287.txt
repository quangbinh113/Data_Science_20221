Song Name: The South's Gonna Do It Again
Well the train to Grinder's Switch is runnin' right on time
And them Tucker Boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When ol' Lynyrd Skynrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
Now people down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar
So gather 'round, now gather 'round chillin', get down
Well just get down chillin', get loud
Well you can be loud and be proud
An' you can be proud, here now, be proud you're a Rebel
'Cause the South's gonna do it again and again
Elvin Bishop sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin', but he sure can play
And there's ZZ Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' Barefoot Jerry and C.D.B
Well gather 'round, gather 'round chillin', get down
Well you can get down chillin', get loud
Well you get loud and be proud
Well you can be proud an' be proud you're a Rebel
'Cause the South's gonna do it again, yes it is
