Song Name: Know My Way Around
I know my way around my hometown
I know every back road and red light
Where to get a fake ID
And who to call for some weed
And where the cops like to sit and hide
Know my way around a bar stool
I've had a sip of every bottle up on that shelf
And how to have a night full of shots
And a few on the rocks
And still walk all by myself
But ever since you walked in
Only thing that I've been thinkin' 'bout is my next move
Then we got to talkin'
Told me that you're single
Baby, that's some damn good news
Yeah, the night's still young
And I got nothin' else to do
Except maybe catch a buzz
Maybe fall in love
Baby, you can choose
I just wanna know my way around you
I know my way around a guitar
Yeah, over there's the stage that I just came off
And if you come back to mine
Just say a song that you like
And I will play it for you all night long
Ever since you walked in
Only thing that I've been thinkin' 'bout is my next move
Then we got to talkin'
Told me that you're single
Baby, that's some damn good news
Yeah, the night's still young
And I got nothin' else to do
Except maybe catch a buzz
Maybe fall in love
Baby, you can choose
I just wanna know my way around you
I just wanna know my way around you, yeah
'Cause ever since you walked in
Only thing that I've been thinkin' 'bout is my next move
Then we got to talkin'
Told me that you're single
Baby, that's some damn good news
'Cause ever since you walked in
Only thing that I've been thinkin' 'bout is my next move
Then we got to talkin'
Told me that you're single
Baby, that's some damn good news
Yeah, the night's still young
And I got nothin' else to do
Except maybe catch a buzz
Maybe fall in love
Baby, you can choose
I just wanna know my way around you
I just wanna know my way around you, yeah
