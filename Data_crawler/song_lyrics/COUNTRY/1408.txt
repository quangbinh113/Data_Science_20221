Song Name: Get A Dog
Alright
You need someone by your side
That can handle a joke and hang with the guys
Always happy, glad to be
Sitting pretty with you in your shotgun seat
You get lonely when it's late
Need a friend at the end of the day
Maybe you should get a dog
Have someone to sleep with
Waits for you at home
After you been drinking
Chases you around
Plays your little games
Let's you be a fool
Loves you anyway
If you need someone to run right back to ya
Every time you call
Oh, you should get a dog
You can sleep in all day
Leave the house all a mess, she'll never complain
She'll just smile when you're late
And she don't give a damn how much money you make
Disappear, turn off your phone
Call her a bitch, but she'll still want a bone
Maybe you should get a dog
Have someone to sleep with
Waits for you at home
After you been drinking
Chases you around
Plays your little games
Let's you be a fool
And loves you anyway
If you need someone to run right back to ya
Every time you call
Oh, you should get a dog
Baby, you should get a dog
If you need someone to run right back to ya
Baby, I'm long gone
You should get a dog
Baby, you should get a dog
Have someone to sleep with
Waits for you at home
After you been drinking
Chases you around
Plays your little games
Let's you be a fool
Loves you anyway
If you need someone to run right back to ya
Every time you call
Well, if you need someone to run right back to ya
Baby, I'm long gone
You should get a dog
Baby, you should get a dog
Get a dog
