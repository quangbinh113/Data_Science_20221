Song Name: Once a Day
When you found somebody new
I thought I never would
Forget you
For I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now, I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day (once a day)
All day long (all day long)
And once a night (once a night)
From dusk 'til dawn (dusk 'til dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, everyday, all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away
Lucky me I'm only cryin' once a day
Once a day (once a day)
All day long (all day long)
And once a night (once a night)
From dusk 'til dawn (dusk 'til dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, everyday, all day long
Once a day, everyday, all day long
