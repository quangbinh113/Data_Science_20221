Song Name: Stronger Than You
Ain't a tent revival in the bible belt
Could save me from the hell that you left me in
Been burning up the road ever since you left
Bunch of right wrong turns and another dead end
Rolled back in the hills for some Carolina clear
Guess I must have took it just a little too far
It burned going down 'til I couldn't get up
Came down the mountain feeling empty as the jar
Hey, the way it's going, I'm a goner
Won't live living like this too much longer
Trying to find something stronger
Stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
Spent some time in the desert with a medicine man
Peace pipe smoking like a Santa Fe train
He said, "Son, yeah, I'd help you if I can
But there's rattlesnake venom running through my veins"
Hey, the way it's going, I'm a goner
Won't live living like this too much longer
Trying to find something stronger
Stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
Oh yeah
Hey, the way it's going, I'm a goner
I won't live living like this too much longer
Hey, the way it's going, I'm a goner
I won't live living like this too much longer
Trying to find something stronger
Stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
A bit stronger than you
