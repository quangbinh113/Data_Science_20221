Windows down, country sound
FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon

Cruisin' down some old back road
Now, baby don't you look at me that way
'Cause ya know there's only so much I can take
'Cause ya make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna yaa
Well you know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
It's plain and simple, Girl them dimples
Know just how to turn me on
Now Baby don't you look at me that way
Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause ya make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna
You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over let me hold ya close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out, let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl ya make me wanna
Yeahhhh
