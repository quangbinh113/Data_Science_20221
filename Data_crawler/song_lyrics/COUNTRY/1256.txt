Song Name: This One's Gonna Cost Me
I could roll you up and smoke ya, babe
You know I'm a sucker for a good high
Yeah, sip you slow and drink you straight
'Til every drop in the bottle runs dry
It's always them Friday night plans I just about passed on
That gets me all messed up, and I don't wanna go home
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
I'm already freaking out
There's always a price for the party
And this one ain't slowing down
Ain't no buzz like love, love's like a drug
And hell drugs ain't ever free
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
Yeah, well this one's gonna cost me
I could get hooked on ya like junkies do
Strung out, addicted to a good time
Aw, make me wanna stay in bed
Like a hangover kicking in
The best and the worst thing I ever did in my life
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
I'm already freaking out
There's always a price for the party
This one ain't slowing down
Ain't no buzz like love, love's like a drug
And hell drugs ain't ever free
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
Yeah, well this one's gonna cost me
I never go all in or stay too long
But you got me messed up
And I don't wanna go home, go home, go home
I don't wanna go home
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
I'm already freaking out
There's always a price for the party
And this one ain't slowing down
Ain't no buzz like love, love's like a drug
And hell drugs ain't ever free
There's no telling what this one's gonna cost me
This one's gonna cost me
I could roll you up and smoke ya, babe
You know I'm a sucker for a good high
