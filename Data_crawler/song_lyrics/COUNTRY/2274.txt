Song Name: Girls Night Out
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight ain't nothin' gonna slow me down
I did my time workin' all week
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound
Well, I've been couped up all week long
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone
Well, it's a girl's night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance
'Til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt
Lordy it's a girl's night out
Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe
They can play 'em fast
Or they can play 'em slow
I can do 'em all, just show me the floor
You can give me a little rock and roll
Or even a waltz with the lights down low
I'll still be dancin' when they close the door
Well, I've been couped up all week long
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone
Well, it's a girl's night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance
'Til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt
Lordy, it's a girl's night out
Well, it's a girl's night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance
'Til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt
Lordy, it's a girl's night out
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight ain't nothin' gonna slow me down
I did my time workin' all week
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound
