Song Name: I Only Date Cowboys
I tried the clean cut, but I had to cut that off
I had the bad boy, but he wasn't bad enough
I tried the big city broker, but I broke his heart
I tried the rock pop super, and the football star
But none of them could keep up with me
No, none of them was my cup of tea
Now I only date cowboys with the hat and boots
That can backup a trailer like his truck's on cruise
Kind of cowboy with a wild west heart
If you ain't the Marlboro man, then it's no cigar
Take a couple moves from John Wayne
Learn a thing or two from Jesse James
'Cause I only date cowboys
I'll make it easy and spell it out for you
I need a C, need an O, need a W
Kind of boy, makin' noise, with his bottle of jack
I'm talkin' Billy Rae style with his horse in the back
'Cause I only date cowboys with the hat and boots
That can backup a trailer like his truck's on cruise
Kind of cowboy with a wild west heart
If you ain't the Marlboro man, then it's no cigar
Take a couple moves from John Wayne
Learn a thing or two from Jesse James
'Cause I only date cowboys
I'm into rodeo wrangler raised
Stuck with the six-shooter locked and aimed
I only date cowboys with the hat and boots
That can backup a trailer like his truck's on cruise
Kind of cowboy with a wild west heart
If you ain't the Marlboro man, then it's no cigar
Take a couple moves from John Wayne
Learn a thing or two from Jesse James
'Cause I only date cowboys
