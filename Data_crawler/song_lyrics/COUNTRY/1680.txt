Song Name: Bittersweet, TN
Devoted my life to the passin' of time
Crossed over county to the Missouri line
And how does one sail on the waves of time?
Hey there sailor, can I hitch a ride?
There was a time when you were mine
Oh, there was a time when you were mine
There was a time when you were mine
Oh, there was a time
Well, have one on me, bittersweet
Tennessee
Bittersweet
Tennessee
Goddamn you got old, you got upset you got sick
The livin' took forever, but the dyin' went quick
And oh, just to think you were a little kid
Wonderin' what you'd be when you got big
And there was no time, suddenly
Oh, there was no time, suddenly
There was no time, suddenly
Oh, there was no time
Well, have one on me, bittersweet
Tennessee
Bittersweet
Tennessee
There was no time
There was no time
There was no time
There was no time
To free the flame from burnin' up inside
To thunder like a motorcycle headed down the line
To eat, to weep, to lay me down so sweet
To sow, to reap, or to let our glasses clink
To time
To time, to time
To time, to time
To time, to time
To time
Bittersweet
Tennessee
Bittersweet
Tennessee
Bittersweet
Tennessee
Bittersweet
Tennessee
Well, have one on me
