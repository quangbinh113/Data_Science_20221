Song Name: Home Sweet
Home sweet
Touching down from a six night honeymoon
Sun-kissed kids still drunk on love
Went from all inclusive margaritas in Malibu
To prayin' we could pay rent this month
That doormat says "Welcome Home"
But I think it's wherever I'm with you
It's more than some bricks and stones
No, there ain't nothin' like
Home sweet, you and me
Ain't got much, but we got all we need
Wherever the wind blows, wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, ain't nothin' like, nothin' like
Home sweet
You and me
Your love is like a porch swing on Sunday
Just as gentle as a summer sunrise
They say it's where the heart is
Well, mine's with you babe
Long as I got your hand, I'm fine
Could be a white brick and picket fences
Or some busted AC hotel room
It's all picture-perfect if you're in it
No, it don't get much better than
Home sweet, you and me
Ain't got much, but we got all we need
Wherever the wind blows, wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, ain't nothin' like, nothin' like
Home sweet (nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (nothing like, nothing like)
Home sweet, yeah (nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (nothing like, nothing like)
A quarter acre and a two-bed farm house
Polaroid kiss with a red "Sold" sign
Sittin' on boxes in the livin' room laughin' and cryin'
Just starin' at them two pink lines, huh
Ooh, yeah
Time to make a little more room in our
Home sweet, you and me
Yeah, we got it all, and you're still all I need
Wherever the wind blows, wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, ain't nothin' like, nothin' like
Home sweet (nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (nothing like, nothing like)
Home sweet (nothing like, nothing like)
You and me, yeah (nothing like, nothing like)
(Nothing like, nothing like) Hey
(You and me)
(Nothing like, nothing like)
