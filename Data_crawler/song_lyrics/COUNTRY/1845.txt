Song Name: Hooch
Everybody I know's calling
The second that the sun hit the county line
Trying to get some of that good, good
They all wanna party right (they know)
They want that firewater
That skull cracker
Ol' Smokey Mountain Dew, yeah
That go blind, white lightning when it do what it do
I got 'em howlin' at the moon
I got 'em sipping that 191 proof
I got 'em tippin' back
I got my Chevy sitting heavy riding low and loading down
See me rolling down that mountain
Ain't no doubt, you know I got it
Got that hooch
You know I got that
Got that hooch
(You know I got that-)
I got that corn whiskey
That bootleg
That Chattanooga Juice, yeah
Every stillbilly tip back and they skew
I got 'em howlin' at the moon
I got 'em sipping that 191 proof
I got 'em tippin' back
I got my Chevy sitting heavy riding low and loading down
See me rolling down that mountain
Ain't no doubt you know I got it
Got that hooch
You know I got that
Got that hooch
(You know I got that-)
I'm that guy you say you know ya
When you say you know a guy
Every Gеorgia peach calling
Wanting my apple pie
Hеy, Drew, it's Amber
I'm gonna need you to bring more of that apple this Friday
I got 'em howlin' at the moon
I got 'em sipping that 191 proof
I got 'em tippin' back
I got my Chevy sitting heavy riding low and loading down
See me rolling down that mountain
Ain't no doubt you know I got it
I got 'em howlin' at the moon
I got 'em sipping that 191 proof
I got 'em tippin' back
I got my Chevy sitting heavy riding low and loading down
See me rolling down that mountain
Ain't no doubt you know I got it
Got that hooch
I got, you know I got it
Got that hooch
You know I got that
You know I got it
Got that hooch
You know I got that hooch, baby
