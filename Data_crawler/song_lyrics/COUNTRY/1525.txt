Song Name: Paycheck to Paycheck
On Monday mornin' I'm a-hemmin' and a-hawin' tryin' to get myself in gear
I'm on a hard-hat crew 'cause the bills are due and I'm in up to my ears
But come Friday night I'll be feelin' right when I'm cashin' my check downtown
Where the liquor's sold and the beers are cold and the jukebox turned up loud
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time
I just dropped one in a jukebox
I can't hold myself in line
Tell the IRS to shove it
And give me eleven twenty-nine
I'm livin' paychеck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime
I been churnin' and a-burnin' and a-workin' on thе weekends for goin' on fifteen years
I tried to save my pay for a Chevrolet but then I spent it on fifteen beers
Now I got a bank loan on a two tone Pontiac GTO
Well Paycheck in the tape deck and blarin' on the radio
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time
I just dropped one in a jukebox
I can't hold myself in line
Tell the IRS to shove it
And give me eleven twenty-nine
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime
I've got an empty bottle and a broken heart and you're still on my mind
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time
And I don't waste a dime
