Song Name: Cowboys Did Cocaine
Take me back in a cadillac
When the sinners were the saints
Mama tried and the fiddles cried and the liquor ran like rain
Sell my soul to rock n roll
At the devils choir say
The opera shook and God was good
When cowboys did cocaine
I could use a middle finger
Men in black
Sank when in prison track
Hell brake me out of this same old thang
I could use a conversation with the heart slayed out in a honkatonk
Get daddy let a dog in my vein
Now i ain't wanna speak the way that
But i think if he was here today he'd say
Take me back in a cadillac
When the sinners were the saints
Mama tried and the fiddles cried and the liquor ran like rain
Sell my soul to rock n roll
At the devils choir say
The opera shook and God was good
When cowboys did cocaine
(Cowboys did cocaine)
(Cowboys did cocaine)
I could take a sunday morning coming down even out with another round
I need that steady drip like the rain
I want the highway high
A second ride
That sugar to my brain
Take me back in a cadillac
When the sinners were the saints
Mama tried and the fiddles cried and the liquor ran like rain
Sell my soul to rock n roll
At the devils choir say
The opera shook and God was good
When cowboys did cocaine
(Cowboys did cocaine)
(Cowboys did cocaine)
I wanna be the outlaws and the inmates
Running with Merl on a jailbreak
Wanna pull the tie with the pullet
When the lights come on at the poor fest
I need a long night
To getting my mind right
In a fight with the devil till the sunlight
Walking with Jhonny on a wild ride
Take me back in a cadillac
When the sinners were the saints
Mama tried and the fiddles cried and the liquor ran like rain
Sell my soul to rock n roll
At the devils choir say
The opera shook and God was good
When cowboys did cocaine
(Cowboys did cocaine)
(Cowboys did cocaine)
(Cowboys did cocaine)
(Cowboys did cocaine)
Take me back in a cadillac
When the sinners were the saints
Mama tried and the fiddles cried and the liquor ran like rain
Sell my soul to rock n roll
At the devils choir say
The opera shook and God was good
When cowboys did cocaine
