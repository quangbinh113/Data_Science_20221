Song Name: My Kinda Party
I worked all week
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved
I got the cover off a '68
I fired it up, and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She's a rockin' them holey jeans
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday?
You know, word's got it, there's gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four-wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine
Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I'll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started, it's my kind of party
If you wanna drink
Go baby, just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell, why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after a while we'll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sippin' on some moonshine
Baby, if you're in mood
You can settle for a one night rodeo
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet
I'll be your Red neck Romeo
Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I'll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started, it's my kind of party
Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I'll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started, it's my kind of party
Y'all ready for this?
Y'all go and turn it on up
