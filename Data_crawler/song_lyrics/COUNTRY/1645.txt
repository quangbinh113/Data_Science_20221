Song Name: I Was Born To Love You
You gave me a sign
You gave me a lift
You take me home when I'm done my shift
You give me a loan
When I'm stone cold broke
Get me high, when I need a toke
I was born to love
I was born to- (born)
I was born to love
I was born to- (born)
Times were tough
We made it through
We tasted the rough
So let's save the spoon
All the time I was hurtin' you
Got to believe that I was hurtin' too
I was born to love
I was born to- (born)
Born to love
I was born to- (born)
Your the only one I can talk to
The only one I can really read
I know you give because you want to
Don't you think it's time you learned to let yourself receive?
Can make you smile
Can make you sing
Just wanna give back a little bit of what you gave to me
I could sing you a song
Play you a tune
I know it's just a little thing but it's somethin' I can do
I was born to love
I was born to- (born)
I was born to love
I was born to- (born)
I was born (born)
To love you
I was born (born)
To love you
