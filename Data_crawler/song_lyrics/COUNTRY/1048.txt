Song Name: Lucille
In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a barstool, she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her, her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said, "I'm no quitter"
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute, I thought I was dead
But he started shakin'
His big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"
After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the barroom
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cause the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
This time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille"
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
