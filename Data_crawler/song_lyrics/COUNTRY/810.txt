Song Name: Love You Like I Used To
Girl, I have always loved you
Oh but something's changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride
But It ain't the same
It's a different kind of feeling
Not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips
To how your hand in mine fits
Girl, I have always loved you
But I don't love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It's stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don't love you like I used to, no
What we got ain't got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It's sweeter with time like strawberry wine
It gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant way back then
Why would I keep fallin' all-in higher than I've ever been?
Oh no, I don't love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It's stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don't love you like I used to, no
No, no, no, no

I don't love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It's stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don't love you like I used to
(I, I love you like, love you like)
I don't love you like I used to
(I, I love you like, love you like, love you like, love you like)
No, no, no, no
(I, I love you like, love you like)
Love you like I used to, no
(I, I love you like, love you like)
Oh, I don't
Love you like I used to
