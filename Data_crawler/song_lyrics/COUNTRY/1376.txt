Song Name: Time of the Cottonwood Trees
It was the time of the cottonwood trees
The time of the cottonwood trees
I met her at the Pale Horse Saloon
Yes I did, yes I did
Her pretty hair was brown, her eyes were too
Yes they were, yes they were
It was the time of the cottonwood trees
I don't know if it was all a dream
She drove a blue pickup truck
Boy, she loved it though it really wasn't much
Kinda like the way she loved mе
In the time of the cottonwood trees
Thе time of the cottonwood trees
She followed me up the Rio Grande
Yes she did, yes she did
She said she liked the way I crossed the land
That's a fact, that's a fact
It was the time of the cottonwood trees
I could smell that sage on the breeze
I drove her blue pickup truck
Boy, she loved it though it really wasn't much
Kinda like the way she loved me
In the time of the cottonwood trees
The time of the cottonwood trees
It was the time of the cottonwood trees
It's hard to figure what life really means
I can still see a blue pickup truck
Boy, she loved it though it really wasn't much
Kinda like the way she loved me
In the time of the cottonwood trees
The time of the cottonwood trees
The time of the cottonwood trees
