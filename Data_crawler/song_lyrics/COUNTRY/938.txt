Song Name: Medley: Winter Wonderland / Sleigh Ride
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the newbird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?" we'll say "No man"
"But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, oh, the plans that we made
Walking in the winter wonderland
Just hear those sleigh bells jingleing
Ring ting tingleing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you yoo-hoo, whoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
When he says "Are you married?" we'll say "No man"
"But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Woo-ooo
Oh baby, come on and walk with me
Ooh, why don't you? (Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Why don't you? (Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Oh baby (Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Ooh
Take my hand, come on and walk with me (Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
(Walk along, talk along, sing along right now) Oh
(Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Why don't you just go with me?
(Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
(Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Oh, my (Walk along, talk along, sing along right now)
Oh, my, my
