Song Name: Ready to Run
When the train rolls by
I'm gonna be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I'm gonna be ready this time
When my momma said I look good in white
I'm gonna be ready this time
Oh, yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'm gonna be ready this time
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
I'm gonna be ready this time (ready this time)
You see, it feels like I'm starting to care
And I'm gonna be ready this time (ready this time)
Oh, yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
Ready to run
Ready to run
Oh
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
Ready to run
Ready to run
Ready to run
I'm ready to run
Ready to run
Ready to run
I'm ready to run
I'm ready
Oh, I'm ready to run (I'm ready)
Ready to run (I'm ready)
Ready to run (I'm ready)
