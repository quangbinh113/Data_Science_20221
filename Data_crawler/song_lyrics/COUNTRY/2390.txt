Song Name: Steal My Love
Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
Can't take my eyes off you
Even if I wanted to
I swear I'm staring at Heaven
Holding you here tonight
Watching all the stars align
I wanna stay for forever
Yeah, the sky could be fallin'
The world could unravel
But you'll still be safe in my arms, oh-oh
Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never
My heart is yours forever
If I couldn't call you mine
Then, baby, you know I don't want no one
My car, my clothes, my money
Take it all, but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love
Tattoo your name on me
So I can wear it on my sleeve
Make sure that everyone knows it (knows)
'Cause, baby, you're the one thing that I can't live without
You kiss me and there ain't a doubt (oh-oh, oh-oh)
No changing my mind, I'm in it for life
Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never
My heart is yours forever
If I couldn't call you mine
Then, baby, you know I don't want no one
My car, my clothes, my money
Take it all, but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
As long as stars are dancing 'round the moon
There'll never be a me without you
Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never (oh, yeah)
My heart is yours forever (my love, my love)
If I couldn't call you mine
Then, baby, you know I don't want no one (don't want), no one (no one)
My car, my clothes, my money (take it all)
Take it all, but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love
