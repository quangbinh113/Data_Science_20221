Song Name: Fast as You
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong
Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right
You'll control me
Oh so boldly
Rule me till I'm free
Till the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Ahh
You'll control me
Oh so boldly
Rule me till I'm free
Till the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Ahh suckie
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one that's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
You're gonna learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Yeah well maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
