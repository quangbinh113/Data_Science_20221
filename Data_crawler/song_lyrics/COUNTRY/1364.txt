Song Name: Country Round Here Tonight
Everybody knows that down at ole Joe's
He's icing them long necks down
Dusting them stools off, racking them pool balls
'Bout to turn the closed sign 'round
Little later on, when the sun gets gone
Gonna be a crowd 'neath the neon lights
It won't be long 'til the good time's on
'Bout be get country 'round here tonight
For all them boys in the fields making dollar bills
Stacking that hay up high
All them girls in the sand working on their tans
Down by the riverside
Getting through the day, hell, they just can't wait
To congregate 'round a cold beer sign
And tie one on to a jukebox song
'Bout to get country 'round here tonight
There's a backed-up line of four-wheel drives
Filling up the parking lot
This little bar they call a hole in the wall
Is everybody's favorite spot
There's a sawdust floor, waiting on the door
To swing wide open, let us all inside
Paycheck cash is gonna go fast
'Bout to get country 'round here tonight
For all them boys in the fields making dollar bills
Stacking that hay up high
All them girls in the sand working on their tans
Down by the riverside
Getting through the day, hell, they just can't wait
To congregate 'round a cold beer sign
Tie one on to a jukebox song
'Bout to get country 'round here tonight
So let that Crown and a cold beer pour
Honky Tonks and Friday nights are for
All them boys in the fields making dollar bills
Stacking that hay up high
All them girls in the sand working on their tans
Down by the riverside
Getting through the day, hell, they just can't wait
To congregate 'round a cold beer sign
Tie one on to a jukebox song
'Bout to get country 'round here tonight
It won't be long 'til the good time's on
'Bout to get country 'round here tonight
