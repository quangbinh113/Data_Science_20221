Song Name: Drink, Swear, Steal & Lie
I was 12 when daddy said to me
"Don't take to drinking, boy
That road don't lead nowhere
And don't you ever let me hear you swear
Don't you dare"
He told me, "Stealing's a lazy man's way
Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay
So don't buy into it
And then you can look the whole world in the eye"
Honey, I've tried
But since I met you, girl
I've been breaking every rule
I must confess, I'm just a back sliding fool
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you
Look at what you made me do
Darling, you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Last night I threw away the 12 step book
I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do
Ain't no use
'Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace
I swear
Girl, I'd admit I haven't got a prayer
But I don't care
I know this ain't exactly how I was raised
But heaven help me,, honey
I ain't changing my ways
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you
Look at what you made me do
Darling, you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you
Look at what you made me do
Darling, you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Drink, swear, steal and lie
