Song Name: Happier Alone
Do you ever turn the lights down?
Do you ever dance alone?
Do you wish that I was somehow, someway, somewhere closer to home?
Does it ever cross your mind?
You could be happy alone
Instead of always waiting, pacing, saying 'I Love You' through the phone
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
I always think about the future
I know I'm gonna miss her
One day she's gonna realize that real life as my wife has nothing to show
I should probably take time
I should probably go
Back over the state line, tonight, to find what I already know
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
You could be happier
You could be happier
You could be happier alone
Happier alone
Happier alone
You could be happier alone
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
(Happier alone)
