Song Name: That's My Story
I came in as the sun came up.
She glared at me over her coffee cup.
She said, "Where you been?"
So I thoguht real hard and said,
"I fell asleep in that hammock in the yard."
She said, "You don't know it boy, but you just blew it."
And I said, "Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
That's my story.
Oh, that's my story.
Well, I ain't got a witness, and I can't prove it,
But that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."
I got that deer-in-the-headlight look.
She read my face like the cover of a book and said,
"Don't expect me to believe all that static,
'Cause just last week I threw that hammock in the attic."
My skin got so thin so you could see right through it,
And I stuttered, "Well that's my story and I'm stickin t-t-to it.
That's my story.
Well, that's my story.
I ain't got a witness, and I can't prove it,
But that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."
You know the time comes when a wise man knows
The best thing that he can do is just look her in the eye
And beg for mercy and face the bitter truth...
Well honey me and the boys played cards all night.
There wasn't no hanky-panky, not a woman in sight.
I know I should called, and baby I. I'm really sorry,
But get a cellular phone and then you won't have to worry.
You know how much I love ya, darling, and I'm ready to prove it.
And that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
That's my story,
Oh, that's my story.
Well I ain't got a witness and ya know I can't prove it.
But that's my story and I'm stickin' to it.
You know I ain't gonna do a thing darling unless you approve it.
And that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
