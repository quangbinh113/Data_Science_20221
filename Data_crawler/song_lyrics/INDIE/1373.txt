Make sure
Your dilation
Can mix well
With apathy
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Whether we could be
Our sinking flags
Our autonomy
(Autonomy, heh)
(Woo!) Yeah, I'm missin' my way in life
Man, I'm wishin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm kissin' the sunrise
I'm fallin' for the feelin'
Under pressure
But I'm back on the road
I'm good in the right light
(It's on the way)
Wait for me (woo!)
Before you go
I'll fall apart again
Wait for me
I'll fall apart again (again, again, again)
Got a star
It's under pressure
And everyday
It's calling my name
But lately
It's ammunition
To pipe down
(I'll call your name)
Wait for me (woo!)
Before you go
(And we'll) fall apart again
Wait for me
We'll fall apart again (again, again, again)
Fall apart (again), I'll fall apart
Fall apart
We'll fall apart again (again, again)
Wait for me (you gotta)
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Before you go
(And we'll) fall apart again
Wait for me
We'll fall apart again (again, again, again)
Wait for me (woo!)
Before you go (go)
(And we'll) fall apart again
Wait for me (woo!)
We'll fall apart again (again, again, again)
(Wait for, wait for me)
