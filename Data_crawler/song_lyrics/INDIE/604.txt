Song Name: Art Hoe
5"4, black hair, never had her dad there
Kissed a lot of boys but
Never seems to have care
She just wants vodka and cigarettes
Has the dealer on speed dial
When she gets stressed
And she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
That I can't resist her ways
And she knows, she knows
Im so exposed
To all the tricks she plays
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
She's got a tattoo sleeve
And smokes a bag of weed
And her haircuts
Way fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
Wakes up at noon
Gets up when she has to
Makeup on her nightstand
Cocaine in her bathroom
She just wants love that she never gets
Has my number on speed dial
When she needs sex
And she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
I can't resist her ways
She knows, she knows
Im so exposed
To all the tricks she plays
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love gettin my heart broke
Shes got a tattoo sleeve
And smokes a bag of weed
And her haircut is way
Fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I wish I never got
Caught up and never talked
To her, oh what did I do
She ripped my heart in half
Took me for all I have
Got nothing left but it's cool
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
She's got a tattoo sleeve
And smokes a bag of weed
And her haircuts way fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
