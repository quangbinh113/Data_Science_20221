Song Name: Two Face
Walked up to your door, will you let me in?
Hello loneliness, brotherly kin
When you close your eyes
Do you think of me
Singing every word
Holding both your hands
Crying by your side
I can't build no new nothing
No new life
No new nothing for me
I've gotten all of my bricks aligned
But mortar's escaping me
I can't build no new nothing (Ze wandering)
No new life
No new nothing for me
I've gotten all of my bricks aligned (my mind numbing)
But my mortar's escaping me (say something)
Palms make future plans
You might let me in
Goodbye mercury, loverly sin
When you close your eyes
Do you think of me
Singing all your words softly
I can't build no new nothing
No new life
No new nothing for me
I've gotten all my bricks aligned
But mortar's escaping me
I can't build no new nothing (Ze wandering)
No new life
No new nothing for me
I've gotten all my bricks aligned (my mind numbing)
But my mortar's escaping me (say something)
Stars are created by fire
Yeah, fire in my mind
Well, this, this is not about dying
Talk about the heat beneath your feet
Or the heat beneath your God
Now, I wasn't trying to come spread lies
I just wanna spread truth, you know what I mean?
Where is the order, you know what I'm saying?
Alright, here we go and thank God
You know, talking when you're feeling down about that
I wanna feel it in our heart, baby
