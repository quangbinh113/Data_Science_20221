Song Name: Running Low
Weeks on and I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times, but I
I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it from me
To end this, darling, ooh
And I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go, woah
It may be I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Thinking back to every night
We just layed there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes, woah
I never thought I'd take it back
Just know it takes it from me
To end this, darling, oh, yeah
And I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah
It may be I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Just needed time to
To find my own
But I promise someone
Will give you all you want
And give you all you need
And you just got to see
I never meant to hurt you, no
Yeah
And I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry but I have to go
