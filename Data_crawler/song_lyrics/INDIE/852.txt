Song Name: lust to love
I can't get over something
Something I can't explain
My heart is overflowing
Don't let it wash away
Please just let me sweep you off your feet
Don't you leave me alone
Tell me I'm the only one you need
And will never let go
Falling out of lust, and into love
With every inch of your body
Started as a crush, and now I'm stuck
And I want you to want me
Every time I get to touch you
I just want so much more of you
I can't stop
Falling out of lust
Falling into love, love, love, love
I want to breath you in and
Fill up my lungs
With you it's all or nothing
How far we've come
Please just let me sweep you off your feet
Don't you leave me alone
Tell me I'm the only one you need
And will never let go
Falling out of lust, and into love
With Every inch of your body
Started as a crush, and now I'm stuck
And I want you to want me
Every time I get to touch you
I just want so much more of you
I can't stop
Falling out of lust
Falling into love, love, love, love
