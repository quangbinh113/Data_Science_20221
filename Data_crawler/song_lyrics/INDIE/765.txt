Song Name: space girl (feat. chloe moriondo)
Space girl, show me the stars
You know the galaxies of my heart
Girl, are you a Cancer?
'Cause you make me cry
When we kiss or dance in the sky
We're dancing in the sky
Hey Chloe, you ready?
Hm, my turn
Space girl, I wanna give you a ring
I'm spinnin' on Saturn when you call me your little human thing
Ooh, space girl, you know that I'll never leave ya
I'll stay glued stuck to you 'cause you know I'm a Libra
I wanna be your king
Or be your queen
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you need
Girl, are you a Cancer?
'Cause you make me cry
When we kiss or dance in the sky (in the sky)
We're dancing in the sky (the sky)
I hope you play this song some day
And think of Earth girl who loves space girl
I hope you play this song some day
And think of Earth girl who loves space girl
I hope you play this song some day
