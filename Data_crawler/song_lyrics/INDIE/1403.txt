Song Name: The Limit
I'm turning around
No, I can't see the ground
Don't sow what you reap
Don't feel what you see
Submit to the grace
The waters erase
Nothing left to see
I'm you and you're me
Don't single it out
Don't simplify it
Don't kill what you know
Don't speak when you reach...
The limit
The limit
Current with no direction
Current with no direction
The limit...
I'm turning around
No, I can't see the ground
Don't sow what you reap
Don't feel what you see
Submit to the grace
The waters erase
Nothing left to see
I'm you and you're me
Don't single it out
Don't simplify it
Don't kill what you know
Don't speak when you reach...
The limit
Yo, tan cerca del vacío
Tan cerca de tu lío
Pero sin despegar
Sin despegar
Sin despegar
