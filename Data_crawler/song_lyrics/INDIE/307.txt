Song Name: Strange Clothes
You can't explain how you're feeling
Whole world's been turned upside down
But I hope
That you've notice the strange clothes
Get away from the feeling
And there's a resonance so cold
But I hope
That you've notice the strange clothes
And I swear down, yeah, I swear down
If I could then I would
Feel it all for you
Just keep your head up
You can't feel this dance when your gut hurts
But I hope
That you've notice the strange clothes you're wearing
And I swear down, yeah, I swear down
If I could then I would
Feel it all for you
