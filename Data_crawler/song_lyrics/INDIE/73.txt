Song Name: Territory
Life is slow paced
Like the movies
With filtered mood swings
Oh wait, they're indie
We are not like that
We are not the same
No o oh oh o o oh oh o
I wear my game face
In your headspace
Where it's storming
At least most days
We are both like that
We are both the same
Oh o oh oh o o oh oh o
So tell me something
Anything but nothing
Now
Do you wanna be my territory?
Baby, search and then destroy me
Keep me close and we won't get boring
Keep me close like your territory now
Keep me close like your territory now
So keep me close like your territory
Life is slow paced
And I've been thinking
We've lost a few years
In the quicksand
We are not like that
We are not the same
No o oh oh o o oh oh o
I think the answer
Is in the open
Keep me close like I was chosen
We are both like that
We are both the same
Oh o oh oh o o oh oh o
So tell me something
Anything but nothing
Now
Do you wanna be my territory?
Baby, search and then destroy me
Keep me close and we won't get boring
Keep me close like your territory now
Keep me close like your territory now
So keep me close like your territory
I'm gonna hunt you down
Cause I'm a handful
I'm gonna freak you out
But it's all substantial
So bring me bad news
Anything you have to
Just to keep me on my toes
Do you wanna be my territory?
Baby, search and then destroy me
Keep me close and we won't get boring
Keep me close like your territory
Do you wanna be my territory?
Baby, search and then destroy me
Keep me close and we won't get boring
Keep me close like your territory now
Keep me close like your territory now
So keep me close like your territory
Keep me close like your territory now
So keep me close like your territory
Now
