Song Name: Tungs
For if we ain't got the time
I tell ya baby I don't think we're doing fine
We just haven't got a clue
I keep my love
I want my blood inside of you
Do you think I'm cute?
Well it's too late to check
And I don't care
You got your tongue against my neck
Do you like my style?
Have you seen my shoes?
'Cause they've been ripped to shit
From walking the world for you
Everybody knows I'm right
I can't control it
Got my eyes on you all night
We just haven't got a clue
I keep my love
I want my blood inside of you
Do you think I'm cute?
Well it's too late to check
And I don't care
You got your tongue against my neck
Do you like my style?
Have you seen my shoes?
Cause they've been ripped to shit
From walking the world for you
(One, two, three, four)
Do you think I'm cute?
Well it's too late to check
And I don't care
You got your tongue against my neck
Do you like my style?
Have you seen my shoes?
'Cause they've been ripped to shit
From walking the world for you
Do you think I'm cute?
Well it's too late to check
And I don't care
You got your tongue against my neck
Do you like my style?
Have you seen my shoes?
Cause they've been ripped to shit
From walking the world
Ripped to shit form walking the world
Ripped to shit from walking the world for you
