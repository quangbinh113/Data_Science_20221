Song Name: Every Way
I care about you, in every way I can
You know I'm troubled
But I know you can understand
I'm sorry for the strain
No one prepares you for the way in which things change
But you've been amazing, saw me through my darkest stage
And you always forgave me
And now you love me just the same
It means the most, I hope you know
And I hope you know
That I think about you in every single way
You're more familiar to me
More and more each day
I cry in front of you, and it's very necessary, babe
I will care about you, in every way I can
