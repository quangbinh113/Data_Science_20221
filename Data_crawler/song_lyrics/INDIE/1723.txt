Song Name: Love Factory
Each day's her little victory
She knows how to win a fight
And watching the deserters leave
I've got to make it right
Her love is like a factory
And every day she's making me
Her love is like a factory
And every day she's making me
I'll handle for the fallout
And you can take all the heat
We can drive for hours and hours on end
But we'll never even see the sea
Let's go to the thеatre
Let's catch up with friends
Lеt's pray to God that they're still here
When we need them on side again (and again, and again)
Each day's her little victory
She knows how to win a fight (she knows, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got to make it right (I've got, I've gotta make it right)
Her love is like a factory (she's so industrious)
And every day she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (so hard)
And every day she's making me
I can be the bad cop
And you can be the good
I can make us all the things we need
Just, give me some sap and wood
Let's go see a movie
Let's buy a brand-new car
Let's climb the highest mountain range
And forget just who we are (who we are, who we are)
Each day's her little victory
She knows how to win a fight (she knows it, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got to make it right (I've gotta, I've gotta make it right)
Her love is like a factory (oh, she's so industrious)
And every day she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (it's so hard)
And every day she's making me (let's work)
Work with me
I can make a bandage
I can fix a splint
I can recall anything
About everything I've seen
Let's get that leg seen to
Let's keep each other warm
Let's wait for this storm to pass
And head out at the crack of dawn
Each day's her little victory
She knows how to win a fight (oh, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got to make it right (I've gotta make it right)
Her love is like a factory (oh, she's so industrious)
And every day she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (so hard)
And every day she's making me
