Song Name: Ultimately
Ultimately
I don't understand a thing
I try to do the best I can
I know you try to do the same
We're just so bound to make mistakes
You could call it a disposition
I apologize for all your tears
I wish I could be different
But I'm still growing up
Into the one you can call your love
I don't know if I'll ever be enough
I'm throwing in my chips
I guess I tend to push my luck
And ultimately
I believe we'll be okay
It's so clich√© to say these things
But repetition is a key
I think I'm better when I'm with you
But I worry when you're gone
I think I need to learn to love myself
I must learn to be strong
So, for now we'll say goodbye
Although it pains me in my heart
Your words they come to me in memories
They sing to me like songs
It won't be long until I'm here
Soon I'll make my arrival
Under shady trees, a quiet street
The roads that I have traveled
Ultimately
It's a beautiful thing
Like flowers blooming in a lonely field
The petals drift through crossing winds
That find their way to river streams
That scent the water beautifully
It takes me back to you
It takes me back to you
