Song Name: Sorry I Am
I wish I could tell you
How sorry I am
Have you found someone new?
A Christian man?
And what do you tell your friends?
"It just went down like that"?
And are they terribly impressed?
What do they say behind your back?
I wish I could tell you
You're drop dead kind
You're easy to talk to
And you're generous with time
And where are you living now?
And have you changed up your hair?
(Have you changed your hair?)
And do you keep my friends around?

For purposes unclear (ah!)
For purposes unclear
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
I don't think think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think think I'm ready
To let it go
