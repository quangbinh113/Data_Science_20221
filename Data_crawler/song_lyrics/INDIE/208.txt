Song Name: Cocoon
I know that you must feel like
Facing with the ruin, facing with the ruin
I messed it up as always
I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't know how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened
When I'm weakened
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
I've been always playing
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar
I've been underrating, overestimated
I made it really harm for you
Harm for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
•••
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
