Song Name: Pictures of Girls
I see the end, you wait for nothin'
You and I, we grew up in the suburbs
Now you're gone, the city's down a number
It is not the same without you around, oh
I see you there, still shy, but smilin'
Now I find it hard to remember
All the times I've tried to forget her
I am hangin' on to somethin' real
'Cause pictures of girls are not for me
You see
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
