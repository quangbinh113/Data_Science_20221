Song Name: Cherry
Don't you call him baby
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it

I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him baby
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?
Does he take you walking round his parents' gallery?
Don't you call him baby
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him baby
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Coucou, tu dors?
Oh, j'suis désolée
Bah non
Nan, c'est pas marrant
Ouais, t'es à la plage et maintenant...
Parfait, allez
