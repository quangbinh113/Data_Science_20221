Song Name: Love Letter From The Sea to The Shore
I think I loved you in another life
Where I was the sea
And you were the shore
Like the tourist comes back to the beach
I come back to you for more and more and more
'Cause you hold in my tide
I would die a thousand times
Just to see you in another life
I think I loved you in a thousand ways
'Cause you remain stagnant on my troubled days
No matter how far I drift away
You'll be there when I come back one day
'Cause you hold in my tide
I would die a thousand times
Just to see you in another life
I wish you'd come with me
Move with the swells, my love
I love you too much to drift completely
Wait for me, I'll be back because
You hold in my tide
I would die a thousand times
Just to see you in another life
Ooh, in another life
