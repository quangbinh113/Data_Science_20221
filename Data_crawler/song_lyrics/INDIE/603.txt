Song Name: We Are
We are, we are, we are, we are
They think that we're no one
We're nothing, not sorry
They push us
It's too late, it's too late
Not going back, oh-oh-oh
They think we are made up
Of all of our failures
They think we are foolish
And that's how the story goes
They stand for nothing
They're lifeless and cold
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
Now covered in madness
But they just can't hurt us
They tell us we're nothing
Keep walking and let it go
They are the weakest
They don't even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
"I'm not afraid, not afraid"
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
"I'm not afraid"
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
