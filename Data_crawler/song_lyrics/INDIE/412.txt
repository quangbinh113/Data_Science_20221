Song Name: I Don't Know My Name
I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying
So I heard you are my sister's friend
You get along quite nicely
You ask me why I cut my hair
And changed myself completely
I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying
I went from bland and popular
To joining the marching band
I made the closest friends
I'll ever have in my lifetime
I am lost, trying to get found
In an ocean of people
Please don't ask me any questions
There won't be a valid answer, I'll just say
That I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying
I now know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm not trying
But I'm trying to find my way
