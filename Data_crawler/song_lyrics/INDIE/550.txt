Song Name: Jupiter
Heaven knows you better
Than all this West Coast weather
Honey, not so fast
This is all I ask
Do you feel better?
Do you feel better?
Come on, say you love it
I know you tryna get above it
There's a space outside
And I'm not surprised
I don't remember
I don't remember, hm
And now I'm waking up with you
Michelle is blasting in this room
I'm lovin' everything you do
And I'm drawin' pictures next to you
(Yeah)
Maybe the photo's out of focus
I can't believe that no one noticed
If you think I'm shy
Maybe I'll not mind
I won't remember
I don't remember, hm
And now I'm waking up with you
Michelle is blasting in this room
I'm lovin' everything you do
And I'm drawin' pictures next to you
(Heaven knows you better)
And now I'm waking up with you
(Than all this West Coast weather)
Michelle is blasting in this room
(Heaven knows you better)
I'm lovin' everything you do
(Than all this West Coast weather)
And I'm drawin' pictures next to you
(Than all this West Coast weather)
And now I'm waking up with you
(Than all this West Coast weather)
Michelle is blasting in this room
(Than all this West Coast weather)
I'm lovin' everything you do
(Can't stand this West Coast weather)
