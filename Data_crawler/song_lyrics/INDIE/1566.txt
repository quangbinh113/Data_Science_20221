Song Name: Used To Be Lonely
Well, it made no sense at all
Until you came along
I'm afraid you're letting go
'Cause the only life I've ever known
Used to be lonely
Lonely
Used to be lonely
Lonely
When long days knock you down
When cold winds turn me round
Take me out into the night
'Cause the only way to spend our time
Used to be lonely
Lonely
Used to be lonely
Lonely
Used to be lonely
Lonely
Used to be lonely
Lonely
