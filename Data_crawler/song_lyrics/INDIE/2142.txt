Song Name: Everything Eventually Ends
Peace to the world
Peace to the kids
We all gotta hurt
We all gotta suffer
We all got a heart that bleeds on each other
We all had a mother a sister a brother
Alhamdulillah
You worshiping the gossip
You never fought back
You're conquering your color
The scars on your back
Conceived by the woman
A star you the brightest
Glorified death
Crucified Christ
Sleepy giant gone rest
Blonde hair blue-eyed version ain't shit
Meditate backwards church bells ring worldwide hymns
Footsteps Ethiopian old hunched back
Looked back bible in his hands dodged punch as
Assumptions seeking to expand one's conscious
Conquests, tribal, humans, nonsense
Cosmic, uterus, birthed me, awesome
Comics, aliens, flying saucers
Suffering, solace, praising me, content
Judas, Deborah, scripted, prophets
One phone tap
Hatred for a soul I ain't never seen laugh
Carved out my features with the simplest of math
E equals everything eventually ends
Everyone's dead
Why do you look at me this way?
What role am I supposed to play?
Never on the list at the party
Never quite as cool as you want me
But I don't need a friend I got plenty
That your eyes can't see
Always all alone, never lonely
Got my inner life and it's sunny
I've a million arms there to hold me
That your eyes can't see
Light one in the air
Rip my dawgs finding strength in despair
Loose change
We paved
Swimming through the tears
Fighting through fallacies
Scribbling my notes
Back to my salary
Money don't fold
Brushing my afro
One man's trash be another man's gold
Zoom through with the ray bans on static
Hip hops answer to the magic
Jingle bells rang
Santa Clause hoed down snow on demand
Kiss kiss wet lips throwing these hands
Cook them like holidays billy boy Bragg
I thought I was a man
Why do you look at me this way?
What role am I supposed to play?
Never on the list at the party
Never quite as cool as you want me
But I don't need a friend I got plenty
That your eyes can't see
Always all alone, never lonely
Got my inner life and it's sunny
I've a million arms there to hold me
That your eyes can't see
