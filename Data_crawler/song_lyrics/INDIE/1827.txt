Song Name: i <3 u
I turn off all the lights
I never thought that things could turn that way
What was I supposed to do?
Who could I trust? Needed a shoulder to cry on
You meant much more than that
You took me by surprise
The way you walked into my darkened life
You sent the storm away
Never expected you to be a friend to me
You meant much more than that
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
This I'll say, I love you
You were the only one
Who saw me cry when I was all alone

The finest words you said
Carefully whisper to me in the dark
Come here and I will always be
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
But oh, this I'll say, I love you
(I love you)
You meant much more than that
(I love you)
And you will always do
(I love you)
I didn't have a clue
(I love you)
That I was waiting on you
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
But this I'll say, I love you
Yeah
