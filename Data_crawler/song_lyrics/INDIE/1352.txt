Song Name: Funny Lil Thing
Somedays some shit don't work
Like you feel no pain
But your brain still hurts
Take down that Tylenol
Leave it if you feel they are
You can say you tried nice, tried but
Its funny little thing
Sometimes you float
Sometimes you sink
Sometimes you think (who cares about what you think)
Well you got a funny little faces
But a face can be replaced
So keep on moving, just keep on moving on
Sometimes some lines get crossed
When your head it ain't the same as what you, thought it was
Don't get it twisted it's society that shifted
If it's written in your hand it coming out as hieroglyphics
But Its a funny little thing
Sometimes you float
Sometimes you sink
Sometimes you think (who cares about what you think)
Well the sum is right
The parts are wrong
You're feeling good
You're blinking and the feeling's gone
So keep on moving, just keep on moving on
