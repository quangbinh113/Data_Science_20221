Song Name: When I Look Into Your Eyes
I kinda like you, kinda think that you're too much
You're always knocking me off of my feet
I'm not against something like falling in love
But I'm not so sure if that's what I need
I'm always making things harder than they need to be
Setting myself up just to crash and burn
So don't you tell me that I'm just overthinking
I've always been a pretty slow one to learn
You know it's hard to face the truth
'Cause I'm no open book and you're overdue
But the precious, enticing
And I don't owe a thing to you
Reading up on every sign
So when I look into your eyes I know
I drive you crazy in my own special way
But I swear that I will never steer you wrong
This Valentine's won't mean a thing if you leave me
'Cause by your side's right where I belong
I have my problems but I can't make them yours too
Someone to lean on's what I'm hoping for
I'll wipe away your tears if your sleeve's my tissue
There's nothing else that I would adore
'Cause when you find love there's not much you can do
No matter what it seems to catch me off guard
But the precious, enticing
And I don't owe a thing to you
Reading up on every sign
So when I look into your eyes I know
