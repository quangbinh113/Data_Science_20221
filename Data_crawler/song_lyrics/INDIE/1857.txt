Song Name: Sun Outside My Window
I can feel a change coming again
You tell me I'm wrong
Is it all pretend?
But I see you there
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
And there's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
I could sense a shift coming from you
But I guess I know you now
Was it ever true?
But I see you there
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
And there's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
I want you evermore
I need you evermore
I want you evermore
I need you evermore
But I see you there
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
And there's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
