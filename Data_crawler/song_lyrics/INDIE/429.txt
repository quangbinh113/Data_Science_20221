Song Name: Body Count
Yeah
You don't gotta tell me 'bout your body count
I don't gotta know your ex's name
'Cause if it just so happens that you turn around and ask me
I think you might feel some type of way
I dodge dick on the daily
I know it's funny but it's true
And I bought this Mercedes all by myself
Got the papers to prove
We don't need no one
Trying to take our freedom
Time won't let you stay young
So we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love
You don't gotta tell me'about your body count
Baby I ain't gonna post you on my page
'Cause odds are that goodbyes are cumming soon
So maybe you should put a rubber
On your heart before it breaks
'Cause all your friends want my baby
I know it's funny but it's true
But some nights I would rather make love to myself
Singing to my own damn tune
We don't need no one
Trying to take our freedom
Time won't let you stay young
So we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love
I saw my ex and then I swerved
Sue me
Miss me with that bullshit for the birds
Sue me
I know they did me dirty while I still had title
But I don't hold any anger I just swerve
Hallelujah
(Hoo hoo) yeah, (hoo hoo) yeah, (hoo hoo) yeah
Hallelujah
(Hoo hoo) yeah, (hoo hoo) yeah, (hoo hoo) yeah
I swear I said do it on your-
