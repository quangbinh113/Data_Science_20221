Song Name: The Principal
Sneaky, creepy
Money seeking
Always peeping
Fucking creeping
Got it on the down low
So you think you're always sneaky
What if I had told your mother
Her son was a cruel motherfucker? Oh
It's not just me, it's everybody
Who thinks that you're fucking ugly
When you come and hurt us
Just so you can get your money
Forced to follow the leader
Who's being possessed by demons
I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night
Prescription pills and on-line fights
Shooting at the angels while claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
"Fuck our dreams" and that's not right
The principal, oh-oh, oh
Where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle? Oh-oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
Complicated, overrated
You're fixated and elated
By the separation
In this place that you've created
Fuck all of your rules and guidelines
You shouldn't even be on the sidelines
Can't you see that we're all hurting?
If you're not teaching, we're not learning
Excuse me, how much are you earning?
I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night
Prescription pills and on-line fights
Shooting at the angels while claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
"Fuck our dreams" and that's not right
The principal, oh-oh, oh
Where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle? Oh-oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
You don't know the pain that you are causing
Yeah, your actions hurt, so do your words
The more you try to fuck us over
We will be there yelling at your front door
I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
