Song Name: Disco
And I can't help it with you
Stubborn-hearted, blue
Lights come into the room
When disco plays our tune
'Cause there's nothing like it
Not like the way you move
I can try but I can't hide it from you
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
Admire all of you
But fire burns me too
Can't stop that disco getting through
Can't stop that disco wanting you
'Cause there's nothing like it
Locking my eyes with you
I can't fight it, splitting my mind in two
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
