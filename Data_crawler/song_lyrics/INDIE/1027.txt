Song Name: Freaks
Don't kill me
Just help me run away from everyone
I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
Don't cry
I am just a freak!

I am just a freak!

I am just a freak!

I am just a freak!
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully, I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time!
I won't wake up this time!
I won't wake up this time!
