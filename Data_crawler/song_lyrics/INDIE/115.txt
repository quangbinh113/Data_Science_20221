Song Name: Lights Up
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
Shine
Step into the light
Shine
So bright sometimes
Shine
I'm not ever going back
Shine
Step into the light
Shine
So bright sometimes
Shine
I'm not ever going back
Shine
Step into the light
Shine
It's so bright sometimes
Shine
I'm not ever (oh)
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never going back now
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da (oh)
La-da-da-da-da (oh)
La-da-da-da-da (oh)
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
