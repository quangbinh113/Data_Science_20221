Song Name: IN THE DOG HOUSE
Take your time, call me back
When you're not so damn mad
I left my pad, cause you were mad
I went to smoke with my bro
Chris's car, smoking dope
So stressed out that I can't let go
Let down your walls, don't slam the door
Don't act like you don't love me no more
Now you're mad at me again
I didn't mean what I said
I was mad, you were right
Now I'm all the way up the light
Just call me back when you're not mad
Come back home when I'm not sad
You know, you know it's not so bad
You know, you know it's not so bad
(I think, on Instagram, you're looking at girls that are hot)
