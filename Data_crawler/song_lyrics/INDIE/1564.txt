Song Name: Lonely Shade of Blue
She's like the lonely shade of blue
Counting down the hours
'Til the bell rings after school
So she wrote that night
"Don't fall in love with her," she said
Don't fall in love, don't fall in love
The timing of questions on his mind
Tore their world apart
Now the riddles keep him up
So he wrote that night
"Don't fall in love with him," he said
Don't fall in love, don't fall in love
I said
"Don't you want to disappear?"
Would you do it again, oh, would you take me back?
I said, "Don't you? Baby, won't you? Baby, don't you?"
Would you live it again?
She's like the mystery unsaid
Chasing every rose
With a daydream in her hand
Still holding on
"Don't fall in love with her," she said
Don't fall in love, don't fall in love
I said, "Don't you want to disappear?"
Would you do it again?
Oh, would you take me back?
I said, "Don't you? Baby, won't you? Baby, don't you?"
I said, "Don't you? Baby, won't you? Baby, don't you?"
Would you live it again?
I said, "Don't, don't, don't you want to do it again?"
I said, "Don't, don't, don't you want to do it again, love?"
Don't you want to do it again? No
Said, "Don't, don't"
I said, "Don't you want to do it again?"
She's like the lonely shade of blue
Counting down the hours
'Til the bell rings after school
So she wrote that night
"Don't fall in love with her," she said
Don't fall in love, don't fall in love
