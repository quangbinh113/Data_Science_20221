Song Name: Cloud 9 (feat. Tegan and Sara)
I don't wanna seem the way I do
But I'm confident when I'm with you
Lately all I feel is bad and bruised
Tired of tripping on my shoes
But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
When I start to tumble from the sky
You remind me how to fly
Lately, I've been feeling not alive
But you bring me back to life
But when she loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When she calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually, to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
But when they love me, I feel like I'm floating
When they call me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually, to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
