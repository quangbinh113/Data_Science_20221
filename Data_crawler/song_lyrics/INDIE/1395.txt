Song Name: Blame
Mornings turn to night
And then the night becomes the day
I can't keep with up with time
I keep losing
Still keeping hoping for that win
And you can't change my mind
Not a slave if I'm already free
Not a captive if it's where I want to be
Oo La La La La
Then the Crowd Calls
Oo La La La La La La La
Who's gonna catch me when I fall down
Strolling down these halls
Of rolling dice and waterfalls
I can't help but smile
Troubled fortunes
Lives in shambles
Underneath The flashing lights
Gonna stay a while
Said what I said it don't it don't matter to
Cant be a slave if I'm already free
Cant be a captive if it's where I want to be
Oo La La La La
Then the Crowd Calls
Oo La La La La La La La
Who's gonna catch me when I fall down
Battles won and battles lost
I can't numerate the costs
I've lost, I've lost
I have lost
Not a slave if I'm already free
Not a captive if it's where I want to be
Oo La La La La
Then the Crowd Calls
Oo La La La La La La La
Who's gonna catch me when I fall down
