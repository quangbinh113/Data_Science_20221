Song Name: Love Language
A lot of ways to love you
Teach me through your eyes
What is needed for you
Needed in your life?
Don't wanna go shoppin'
You want picnics in the park
Do you like mornings?
Should we do it in the dark?
It's all foreign to me
I don't speak what you speak
I'll commit to learnin' if you, if you
You're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs
Please be patient with me, with you
Said I wanna be fluent in your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Never wanna get lost in translation
Never wanna be on two separate pages
Swear to me that you'll state facts
If you can take back, know I can take that
I been workin' at it, hoping that you'd notice
I been waitin', I just needed you to focus
Swear to me that you'll show me
Need you to coach me, then we can proceed
And still, it's all foreign to me
I don't speak what you speak
I'll commit to learnin' if you, if you
You're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs
Please be patient with me, with you
Said I wanna be fluent in your
Love language (Your love)
Learnin' your love language (Oh)
I know I don't speak your language (No)
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language (Love)
Learnin' your love language (Love)
I know I don't speak your language (No)
But I wanna know more, baby
Said I wanna be fluent
In your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language (Love)
Learnin' your love language (Love)
I know I don't speak your language (No)
But I wanna know more, baby
