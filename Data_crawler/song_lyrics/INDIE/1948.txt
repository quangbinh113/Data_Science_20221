Song Name: Goodie Bag
Oh, what they think about you
Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Loving on you
'Til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Joke's on you
Well, it's time to come through
Well, if she had to choose
Me or her mom
I know I wouldn't last long, yeah
No problem with the truth
But when she made me laugh
Doom doom, right to my tomb
I love that it's not hard to be in a place where laughing's easy like
What the fuck is real?
What the fuck is wrong?
I think I can fit with your tone
Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Loving on you
'Til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way you would feel if never said
Joke's on you
Well, it's time to come through
Time to come through
Time to come through
You know I wanna be
Everything that you need
But I'm starting to see

You know I wanna be
Above everything
But I'm just not there yet
