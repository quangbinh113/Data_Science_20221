Song Name: Beige
I don't wanna see you smile
I want you in the mornin'
Before you go performin'
Tell me something I don't know
And lead me to the place where no one ever goes
And let me go under your skin
Let me find the demon that drives those heavenly limbs
You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please, don't let me fall
So please, don't let me fall
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
And I think we'd survive in the wild
We'd make plants and roots and dream about electric fans
Baby, could you kill a man?
Could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands?
Baby, do you think about the past?
Do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this?
You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please, don't let me fall
So please, don't let me fall
You know you're beautiful (you're beautiful)
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul that you got
'Cause I want it all (want it all)
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please, don't let me fall (don't let me fall)
So please, don't let me fall (don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
(Don't let me fall)
