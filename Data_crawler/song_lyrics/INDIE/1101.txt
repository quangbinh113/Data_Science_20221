Song Name: Imagine
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
You couldn't be more wrong
We show up and show out
500 racks, sold out
I never been more proud
Need more light on me (diamond)
Shine on me
This my final form
Tell 'em all, "Chile, please"
Baby, I blow your mind (slander)
Buy all these
(Pussy on) dynamite
(Gimme that) dine on me
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
All this work (this work) paid off (off)
When they had no faith at all (faith at all)
One min', living bummy, then go pray to God (pray to God)
Fuck around and go completely un-relatable
Like imagine, imagine
Thick as fuck but all I eat is salad
Saucing with my thousands on an island
Got imagination 'cause I'm childish
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
