Song Name: Sofia
I think we could do it if we tried if only to say, "You're mine"
Sofia, know that you and I shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried if only to say, "You're mine"
Sofia, know that you and I shouldn't feel like a crime
You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But, oh my god, I think I'm in love with you
Standin' here alone now, think that we can drive around
I just wanna say how I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight, I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine, pull you in, it's alright
I think we could do it if we tried if only to say, "You're mine"
Sofia, know that you and I shouldn't feel like a crime
Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
But, I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried
I think we could do it if we tried if only to say, "You're mine"
Sofia, know that you and I shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could, I think we could do it, we could, we could do it, do it, do it if we tried (I think we could do it if we tried)
Sofia, know that you, you, you and I shouldn't feel like a crime (I think we could do it if we tried, yeah)
I think we could, I think we could do it, we could, we could, do it, do it, do it if we tried (you and I shouldn't feel like a crime)
Sofia know that you, you, you and I shouldn't feel like a crime (Sofia, know that you and I, hmm)
I think we could do it if we tried
