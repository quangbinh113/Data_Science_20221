Song Name: Hope You're Not Happy
Looks like you've been doing well
Looks like you found someone else
How's your family? How've you been?
I'm doing good, I guess
Looks like God is on your side
Looks I've been off your mind
I'll give you one more pretty smile
And wish you all the best
But the truth is
I hope you're not happy without me
I hope that it's hard to get out of bed
I hope you get angry about me
I hope you're not happy ever again
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Ever again
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
I still think of sunny days
Lightning flashes on my face
Rain reminds me you were mine not so long ago
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
I want you to know
That the truth is
I hope you're not happy without me
I hope that it's hard to get out of bed
I hope you get angry about me
I hope you're not happy ever again
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Ever again
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Ever again
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Ever again
I hope you're not happy ever again
