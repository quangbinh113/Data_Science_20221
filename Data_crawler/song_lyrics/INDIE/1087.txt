Song Name: Over - Sped Up
Every time we link up, it's only us there
We're thinking will we get there?
Is it wrong, is it right?
You know that I miss you
But I be gettin' mixed signals, why you slow down?
Don't stop, it's a green light
Now you callin' me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wan' get aggressive
Oh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on makin' believe
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me, what am I fiend?
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinkin' my feelings over
You keep doin' it over and over
You keep callin' me back
I'm just tryna get closure
But you pullin' me closer and closer
Phone ringin' like over and over
'Cause you keep callin' me back
La, la, la, la, la, la-la
Why you keep callin' me back?
Back
Love me, then you switch up
I'd rather we never pick up
But can we slip up and mix up sometimes?
You say you don't mean it
Just want it when it's convenient
Am I crazy for waitin'? I might slide
Now you callin' me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wan' get aggressive
Oh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on makin' believe
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me, what am I fiend?
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinkin' my feelings over
You keep doin' it over and over
You keep callin' me back
I'm just tryna get closure
But you pullin' me closer and closer
Phone ringin' like over and over
'Cause you keep callin' me back
La, la, la, la, la, la-la
Why you keep callin' me back?
Back
(Over and over and over)
Now you walkin' on a thin line
We been through it like ten times
I'ma put you in line
Yeah, I had you on an incline
Now I don't even want to reply
I'ma have to decline
Yeah, you show me I don't want to rewind
Yeah, know you a ten, but that attitude ain't fine
