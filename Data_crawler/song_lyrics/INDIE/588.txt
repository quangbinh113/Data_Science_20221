Song Name: TONIGHT (feat. iann dior)
We're holding onto nothing
And we're holding on too tight
This night is almost over now
But we won't say goodbye (look)
I walked into the party alone (fuck)
My ex calling me on the phone (hello)
Broken bottles can't break my heart tonight (oh no, oh no)
So take a shot with me and we'll go on and on and on and on
Take shots with me and we'll go on and on
We're holding onto nothing
And we're holding on too tight
This night is almost over now
But we won't say goodbye
It's everything I wanted
They say, "Enjoy the ride"
We're holding onto nothing
Yeah, we're holding on too tight (yeah!)
Now I'm wasted on the floor (whoa)
I got cigarette holes in my shirt
And I'm laying with a girl that I don't know
I don't know, know, know, know
She took a shoot with me and we went
On and on and on and on (shot, shot)
She took shots with me and we went on and on and on
We're holding onto nothing
And we're holding on too tight
This night is almost over now
But we won't say goodbye
It's everything I wanted
They say, "Enjoy the ride"
We're holding onto nothing
Yeah, we're holding on too tight (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na
Yeah we're holding onto nothing (na na na)
And we're holding on too tight (na na na)
This night is almost over now (na na na)
But we won't say goodbye (na na na)
Jaden if you don't pick up the phone right now
That's not funny
