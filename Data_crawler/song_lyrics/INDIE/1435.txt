Song Name: Crushed Velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
Feel myself when
I'm in crushed velvet
Girl, I'm selfless
Said I could make it to heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Girl, I'm selfless
Said I could make it to heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Girl, I'm selfless
Said I could make it to heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
Crushed velvet
I'm in heaven
I feel my best when
I'm dressed in all crushed velvet
