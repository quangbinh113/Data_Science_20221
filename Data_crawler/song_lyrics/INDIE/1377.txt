Song Name: IF THEREâ€™S NO SEAT IN THE SKY (WILL YOU FORGIVE ME???)
(Yes, mmm)
(Yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
(Yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
(Yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
(Yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
This is my last life
This is the last chance for you and I
This is-, this is-, this is- (yep, mmm)
Ooh
This is the last time
This is the last chance for you and I
This is-, this is-, this is-
I, mmm
I, I, mmm
(I didn't know)
(I didn't even know)
I've never felt so misunderstood
(I, mmm)
(I, I didn't know)
(Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep)
I'm the image of your enemy
A reflection of a friend or a temporary lover
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
I figure eight, figures of speech
I don't speak what I mean but you were mine in my mind
Oh, I never told you, sometimes when we fight
I even cry but not last night, I was outside all night
Looking into the sky
Ask the sky why I see blue in windowless rooms
Ask the indigo moon
Does she have any room for me?
Just one seat, one seat in the sky
(Yep, mmm, yep mmm, yep, mmm)
This is my last life
This is the last chance for you and I (yep, mmm)
This is-, this is-, this is-
Ooh
This is the last time
This is the last chance for you and I
This is-, this is-, this is- (yep, mmm, yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
Ooh
This is the last time
This is the last chance for you and I (yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
This is-, this is-, this is-, this is-, this is- (yep, mmm, yep, mmm)
Ooh
I'm the image of your enemy
A reflection of a friend or a temporary lover (ooh)
I figure eight, figures of speech
I don't speak what I mean but you were mine in my mind (ooh, ooh)
