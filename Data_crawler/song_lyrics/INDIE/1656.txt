Song Name: Wet Dream
Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go
I was in your wet dream
Driving in my car
Saw you at the side of the road
There's no one else around
You're touching yourself, touching yourself
Touching your, touching yourself
Touching yourself
You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"
You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"
Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go
I was in your wet dream
Driving in my car
What makes you think you're good enough
To think about me when you're touching yourself?
Touching yourself
Touching your, touching yourself
Touching yourself
You climb onto the bonnet
And you're licking the windscreen
I've never seen anything so obscene
It's enough to make a girl blush
It's enough, it's enough to make a girl blush
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, it's enough (to make a girl blush)
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, it's enough (to make a girl blush)
Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
