Song Name: Warned You
He looked to me, it's no surprise
Well I, well I
I could die
But I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you
And if I ever look surprised
Well I
I'm not trying to lie
But I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, oh, ah
