Song Name: Venus Fly Trap
Whatever you give life, you will get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?
I never quite fit in to that Hollywood thing
I didn't play that game for the money or the fame
I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me
Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me
I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reins
I should be motherfuckin' crazy
Nothing in this world could change me
I sacrificed it all for a life to call mine
All the love and security to be myself, oh, I
I know that money ain't important
And it don't mean you're the best
But I earned it all myself and I'm a millionairess
I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me
Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me
I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reins
I should be motherfuckin' crazy
Nothing in this world could change me
They'll shame you, blame you, pretend to even hate you
Take away your rights, pacify you with their lies
Whatever you give life, you are gonna get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?
Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me
'Cause whatever you give life, you're gonna get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?
Nothing in this world, ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Nothing in this world could change me
Me
