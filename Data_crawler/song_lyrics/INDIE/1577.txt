Song Name: Phony
If I could see in the future
Fluent in tapestry
Tarot card witchery'd
Tell me that you might not be there
But it's hard to believe when you're sitting right next me
Sayin' out loud Of how you love me now
Cause I could be running in circles
Tripping on the same pebbles
Crash down cry for help as you
Always do run to the rescue
Any fall can be faltered
A buffer to all of my faults but please
Do watch your step around me
Well you're someone I count on to show up
Even through all the absence in learning from consequence
Who needs a friend when I've got you
Are you sure I'm not too much
I'm sorry it's just how I am
You swear it's not like that, there there
Hey I know that it's 4 in the morning
I've got something to tell you
I've been holding on to and
Now that it's gotten quite heavy
Here you go ain't it terribly ugly
It's just like me to fuck up
Don't let me fall back down
I felt it from the beginning
How your love did collapse
And your pity did atrophy
Slowly decay
No your words didn't fade
Said the pantomime up on the stage
It was all just a play
Did not expect to pay
I was just your waste of time
And I knew that I was right
You phony love of mine
You phony love of mine
