Song Name: Stunnin' (feat. Harm Franklin)
Good job, Curtis (Yeah, yeah, damn)
Curtis Waters (My boy Decz up in Canada)
Ice on my, ice on my neck
Countin' up a check
Ice on my, ice on my neck
Countin' up a check
Ice on my neck that's incoming ('Coming)
I'm a pretty boy, I'm stunning (Stunning)
Super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Super, super, super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Call me big papa, I'm sonnin' (Sonnin')
I supply the dick when she want it (Want it)
I'm a bad boy, McLovin
I'ma, I'ma, I'm a bad boy, McLovin (Yeah)
Hey, good pussy sound like pasta
I got young dick, call the pastor
She give good brain, she a master
Little Einstein, bitch, I'ma blast off
I can go slow or go faster
If I bust quick, that's a bastard
Young Bollywood get gassed up
Get rich quick, big bags, yeah, I'm cashed up
Ice on my neck that's incoming ('Coming)
I'm a pretty boy, I'm stunning (Stunning)
Super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Super, super, super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Call me big papa, I'm sonnin' (Sonnin')
I supply the dick when she want it (Want it)
I'm a bad boy, McLovin (Ayy)
I'ma, I'ma, I'm a bad boy, McLovin (Ayy)
I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She suckin' on my neck like Buffy
On my British bird, I had to go duppy
Fall asleep in that pussy like a cubby (Woo!)
'90s pimp, 2000 pimp (Woo!)
Mercedes drip, CLS (Woo!)
They just gassin', I ain't convinced
She got a peach on her but she ain't a princess (Yeah)
Whoa, used to be a hot boy but I'm straight gorgeous now
Whoa, if you wanna see me you gon' have to book appointments now
Whoa, baby, call me stone cold 'cause I'm so stunnin' yeah
Whoa, I smell like fresh cookies out the oven mixed with money
Ice on my neck that's incoming ('Coming)
I'm a pretty boy, I'm stunning (Stunning)
Super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Super, super, super-speed, Sonic, I'm running
Call me big papa, I'm sonnin' (Sonnin')
I supply the dick when she want it (Want it)
I'm a bad boy, McLovin (Ayy)
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a bad boy, McLovin (Huh)
