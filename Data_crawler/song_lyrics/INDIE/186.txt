Song Name: Sick Feeling
I had to catch the bus
Alarm was shaking, oh
Almost landed on the floor
So ready for you then
To leave was a mistake
What was I waiting for?
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go
I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
And now the rest is leaving me behind
I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
Just let me have another chance
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go
