Song Name: Time of my Life
I think I'm done with 21
This isn't that much fun
I made a bunch of friends
So I could use them as excuses to get drunk
Don't feel like I'm enough
I bought a bunch of shit that doesn't fit
But I can't wait to take it off
I cleaned my room
I paid my dues
I did all of the things that they all told me to
I filled my head
With common sense
I did all of the things that everybody said
So how come all the worst days
Are in the time of my life
Time of my life, time of my
Yeah, baby, it's my birthday
But I still wanna die
Time of my life
I think I'm done falling in love
The last one left me numb
I go to all the parties
But I really only came here for the drugs
Threw out my fake ID
Been staring at the mirror for a year
But that girl still don't seem like me
I cleaned my room
I paid my dues
I did all of the things that they all told me to
So how come all the worst days
Are in the time of my life
Time of my life, time of my
Yeah, baby, it's my birthday
But I still wanna die
Time of my life, time of my
If this is it, I want my money back
Don't make it last
I'm anxious and I can't relax
Yeah, how come all the worst days
Are in the time of my life, time of my life
Guess I'm gonna fake it
'Cause I still look amazing, yeah
I think I'm gonna waste this
Time of my life, time of my life, time of my
If this is it, I want my money back
Don't make it last
I'm anxious and I can't relax
Yeah, how come all the worst days
Are in the time of my life, time of my life
