Song Name: Irrational
I do this sometimes, shouldn't feel it
It's still on my mind, didn't mean it
All the rage that I felt
You know it came from somewhere else
Always does
Always does
It's not what I planned
It's hard to understand
Might not be justified
Used to be alright
Get this feeling that you're questioning me
But this point of view is only temporary
You call it an irrational state of mind
I hate when you expect everything to be fine
To be fine
It's not what I planned
It's hard to understand
Might not be justified
Used to be alright
