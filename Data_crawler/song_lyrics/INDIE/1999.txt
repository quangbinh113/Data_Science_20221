Song Name: Temper Temper
Red wine like blood on the carpet
Cigarettes burn holes where my heart is
Temper temper, you know that that's what I like
You're just doing what you do for reaction
I don't like it so I can tell you can trash it
Temper temper, you know that thats what I like, yeah
You start fights with everybody
I'm the one to say you're sorry
I know we're wrong
But you're not round for long
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving
I only love you when you're gone
Watch the television crash on the pavement
Push and pull yeah thats our arrangement
Temper temper baby you do what you like, yeah
Razor blades on your tongue I can taste it
Fetter me with a permanent vacation
Temper temper baby you do what you like, yeah
You start fights with everybody
I'm the one to say you're sorry
I know we're wrong
But you're not round for long
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving
I only love you when you're gone
I know were wrong
But I don't mind a little psycho
Temper mm-mm
I know were wrong
But I don't mind a little psycho
Temper temper, till late
Yeah I, eh
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving, yeah
I only like you when you're leaving
I only love you when you're gone
I only like you when you're leaving
I only like you when you're leaving, yeah
I only like you when you're leaving
I only love you when you're gone
I only love you when you're gone
