Song Name: Streetcar
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
I don't know what else to say
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
Don't go live your life in vain
