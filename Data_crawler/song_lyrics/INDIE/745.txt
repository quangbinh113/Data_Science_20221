Song Name: January
Wasting time's what I like to do
But I don't waste time when I'm with you
Used to being alone and bored, but when I'm down it starts to pour
Uh oh, I can't do this anymore
'Cause I just want to help out, not something to throw out
Show you I can go out, come out of my self-doubt
And I'm not tryna fool ya, I would like to show you I've changed
And I've changed
I was stuck in a room, with nothing to lose
But now I'm not sure
I was lost in space
I was lost in space but now I found my place
I was lost in space but now I'm in place
I know you
Give me a chance
I don't have many words to say
I don't have many words to say
Because I know you'll go away in no time, in no time now
I know that you'll go in no time, no time at all
So I'm savoring each moment and I breathe in
I breathe in
I know you'll go in no time
No time at all
