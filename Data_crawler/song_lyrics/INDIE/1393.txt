Song Name: Amoeba
Between the gaps, I was swimming laps
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement
We'll gather to our corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
In centerfold, humility's shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn
Aren't you glad that you reside in a hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you've even tried? You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently, but I show up to the party just to leave
Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to 12
The photos keep the sentiment
We'll gather to our corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
In centerfold, humility's shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn
Aren't you glad that you reside in a hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried? You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently, but I show up to the party just to leave
Pulling back, I tried to find the point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy, a fool's way into jealousy
I mock and imitate goodbyes when I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever-while, I show up to the party just to leave
