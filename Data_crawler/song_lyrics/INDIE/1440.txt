Song Name: Something About You
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh
Leave the car at the valet (cash only)
Check me in, pop the champagne (Dom PÃ©rignon)
Pour me a glass, she's got good taste (so good)
Take off our clothes by the fireplace (sexy, yeah)
She looks just like a dream
The prettiest girl I've ever seen
From the cover of a magazine
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh
We stayed up all night and slept 'til noon
It's so nice to wake up next to you
Let's start the day with breakfast in bed
Think I'm gonna love you 'til I'm dead
I can't wait to buy you things
A brand new diamond ring
This is more than just a fling
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh
There's something about you, girl
There's something about you, oh
Something about you
Something about...
