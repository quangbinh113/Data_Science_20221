Song Name: Dance, Baby!
I'm sitting alone
Nobody to hold
The people in here are crazy
Faking a smile now
Been here for a while now
I'm fed up with this
I just wanna go home
But damn, that girl
Set me up with her
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?
I can't understand this
This guy's just a douchebag
I'm so disappointed in myself
The look on her face says
I hope we go places
I'm left alone
Should've stayed at home
And searched how to date on Chrome
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?
I'm sitting alone
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
What does he have that I don't?
I could give the world to you
If you turned him down for me
