Song Name: Revival
I am saved, I am saved
And oh, would you believe it?
All of the day I felt his presence near me
I know they won't believe me
But I've got favorite memories
Well, I am saved, I am saved
And oh, could you believe it?
You won't regret
If you choose to believe it
Freedom, silence, always, yeah
All this darkness, always
Darkness always
It doesn't make much sense
Darkness always
Away from me calling "Stay!"
