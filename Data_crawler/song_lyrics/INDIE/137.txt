Song Name: Thunder
Who said we had limits? Please
Made in your God's image
Tippytoe to the window screen
I can hear you breathe
Last year got us feelin' mental
Out of reach, up on my sleeve
Had something for you since middle school
Think that'll stay
Had something to say
But I forgot amongst the smoke
We could lay down on the floor
If you're bored
Grab a hold of
The fact that we're grown
And we still don't got homes
Got you, but I still feel alone
Feeling close
I got, I got
I got, I got
What you wanted
And I
And I love it
Take it
Away
And I, and I
Take it, Take it
If we can be, we should be
If we were meant to
We could make it work
You're into zodiacs
So what's mine?
Tell me and kiss me at the same time
So I put that out
But I sat back down when you came out
Hey
We're both fucked up
But you know that
Livin' it up
Before we throw caps
And never talk again once you leave in June
Plus I got summer camp in Kansas soon
And like they did in '92
We fell in love
Burnt the posters
Mixtapes that you gave me
All the memories we share, kinda hazy
Still got marks and bites on my lip
Whatever you on just don't trip
Whatever you want
When whatever is wrong
You can
Talk to those other boys but don't talk first
Selfish, plus I know that my words hurt, hey
Sorry's hard, when all this weight's involved
This is the part I hate the most
Fuck that, I hate it all
And I
And I love it
Take it
Away
And I, and I
Take it, take it
Don't leave
