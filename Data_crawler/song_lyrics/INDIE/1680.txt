Song Name: the kid that couldnt keep his name
It's almost funny when it rains
You see the
Amber sunlight fades away
And i tried to make or break or shake that flame
But i'm still the kid that couldn't keep his name
And I just
Im just asking questions
Always asking questions of myself
Always feeling restless
I'm just asking questions
Questions of myself
I'm just asking
Questions
Questions of myself
Stings like silence in the end
And with a word
The walls came crashing on my head
I burnt the fucking candle at both ends
So am I brave or fucking up whats left
And I'm just
Im just asking questions
Always asking questions of myself
Always feeling restless
Im just asking questions
Questions of
My
Self
I'm just asking questions
Questions of myself
