Song Name: Lose Control
Why do I feel like I'm drowning?
Like I'm running out of air, ah-ah-ah
Why do I feel like I'm falling?
When I'm nowhere near the edge, ah-ah-ah
Just let me know
Can you be the one to hold and not let me go?
I need to know
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
When I lose control
When I lose control
When I lose control (I need your love, ah)
When I lose control (I need your love, ah)
When I lose control
When I lose control
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
I know I can be destructive
And I can change the atmosphere, ah-ah-ah
All I ask from you is patience (patience)
Some patience (patience)
Some patience (patience)
Just let me know
Can you be the one to hold and not let me go?
I need to know
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
When I lose control (ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
When I lose control (ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
When I lose control (I need your love ah)
When I lose control (I need your love ah)
When I lose control (ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
When I lose control (ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah (oh)
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah
When I lose control
When I lose control
When I lose control (I need your love, ah)
When I lose control (I need your love, ah)
When I lose control
When I lose control
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?
