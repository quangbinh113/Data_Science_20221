Song Name: Here It Goes Again
It could be ten but then again I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw all on your clothes the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor
Hey!
Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again!
But here it goes again!
Oh, oh, here it goes again
It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of the reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb
Hey!
Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again!
But here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again!
Oh, oh, here it goes again
Oh, oh
Oh, here it goes
Yeah, oh, here it goes again
Hey, hey
Oh, here it goes
Alright
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
But Jesus, when it rains how it pours
Throw on your clothes the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me,
Yeah you leave me
Ah, oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again!
But here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes!
Oh, here it goes!
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have known!
I should have known!
But here it goes again!
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have
I should have
I should have
I should have
I should have known
Oh, oh, yeah
I should have known
Oh, here it goes it again
Oh, oh, here it goes it again!
