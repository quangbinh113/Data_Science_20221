Song Name: Wrong Side of Myself
No, don't put on a front door show
So the stage has been set
But just don't let it get into your bed
I know your sleepy head is on fire
Don't go selling yourself so short
No ghost can bury your hatchets
So upset, just get out of your bed
Convince your sleepy head you're not tired
I've burned up all my bridges
I keep pissing off my friends
I wonder how much longer
They'll put up with all my shit
But baby, I just keep driving me crazy
Everyone's trying to save me
They're all on my side but
I'm on the wrong side of myself
My, my, your tunnel vision looks wide-eyed
But something's gone missing
You're gun shy, upside down on your luck
I know just how it feels to be stuck
I've burned up all my bridges
I keep pissing off my friends
I wonder how much longer
They'll put up with all my shit
Oh baby, I just keep driving me crazy
Everyone's trying to save me
They're all on my side but
I'm on the wrong side of myself
And lately, I've been on a losing streak
Maybe you should stop trying to save me
You're right by my side but
I'm on the wrong side of myself
But baby, I just keep driving me crazy
Everyone's trying to save me
They're all on my side but
I'm on the wrong side of myself
And lately, I've been on a losing streak
Maybe you should stop trying to save me
You're right by my side but
I'm on the wrong side of myself
