Song Name: Ghostride
Daydreaming, I stay in the backseat
The slow beat rocks me back to sleep
Keeps me on automatic
Press my face up close against the glass
I see the people when they pass
They move so automatic
You wake up when I go down
The radio reminds me I'm alive
We've been hearing it all night
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go
But I
Lazy day, I'm so hungry
You melt me like a candle and a flame
But something's pulling you away
We've been stuck up here so long, the phone rings
And reminds me I'm alive, and I'm feeling kinda high
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come, and people go
But I stay
