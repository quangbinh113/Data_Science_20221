Song Name: No More Kissing In The Rain
My dear,
I am running out of time
Out of sync and closing down
And the light begins to fade
I close my eyes in the dark
One look reveals that it's time to leave
Is this the end of everything?
I think It's time to tear it all apart
Some days can feel like razorblades
Cutting through the naked skin
Ready for the next attack?
I catch your eyes in the dark
One look can tell that it's time to go
Is this the end of everything?
Maybe it's time to tear it all apart
No more kissing in the rain
I think we need this last goodbye
You know I know we're growing colder
No more kissing in the rain
No more kissing in the rain
Kissing in the rain
Kissing in the rain
