Song Name: tkm
Will you ever say you love me?
Say you want me, or whatever?
I have wondered if you need me
It doesn't always seem like it
But after all this fightin'
That you need this much time
It's obvious what you think I understand
Will you ever care about me?
Ask about me, talk whenever?
I've been waiting, really struggling
Since forever, to make you smile
And if you say goodbye
I won't be asking why
It's obvious what you think about us
I'm tired of everything
Let me know, oh, do you feel the same?
