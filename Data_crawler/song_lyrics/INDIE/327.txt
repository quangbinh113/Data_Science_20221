Song Name: Easily
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits or call it destiny
Just because it won't come, easily
Doesn't mean, we shoudn't try
We had a good thing goin' lately
Might not have always been a fairytale
But you know, and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
You might've tried my patience greatly
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do somethin' for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits or call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shoudn't try
Comin' and goin'
Inside out, and back to front
All tangled and messy
And that's how we'll feel
And will always be
And that's alright with me
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits or call it destiny
Just because it won't come, easily
Doesn't mean we shoudn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come, easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just because it won't come, easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come, easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
