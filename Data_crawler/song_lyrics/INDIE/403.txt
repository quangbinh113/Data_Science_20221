Song Name: (Online Love)
You only pass through my city
Every once in a million seconds on a broken clock
Yet we talk like we're living
Only miles, only minutes from another
Just around the block
As I stare at my screen
Shining blue and green
All alone in a coffee shop
I can't help but imagine
What maybe could've happened
If you weren't just an online love
Maybe, okay, maybe-
I think he's just
I think he's just going through something
