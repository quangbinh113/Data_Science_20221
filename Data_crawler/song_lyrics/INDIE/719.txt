Song Name: Keep It to Myself
Honestly when we speak
Feels like it's behind her back
'Cause if she saw the chemistry
The dominoes would all collapse
She's not the one you call
At night when you feel lonely
We say we're friends, we know we're not
I know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't, I can't help
That I just wanna keep you to myself
It's a rush, it's a problem
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night
And we still might
I should keep it to myself
Can you tell? I can't help it
That I just wanna keep you to myself
Wanna say everything, everything except the truth
Scared to sit close to you
'Cause I don't trust what I might do
You stare a bit too long
My heart, it beats unsteady
We say we're friends, we know we're not
I know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't, I can't help
That I just wanna keep you to myself
It's a rush, it's a problem
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night
And we still might
I should keep it to myself
Can you tell I can't help it?
That I just wanna keep you to myself
Don't wanna let you go but you gotta know
That I need you, I need you badly
Oh, so tell me why, why you still with her
When you know that deep down you want me
Don't wanna let you go, boy you gotta know
That I need you, I need you badly
Oh, so tell me why, why you still with her
When you know that deep down-
I know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't, I can't help (I can't)
That I just wanna keep you to myself
It's a rush, it's a problem (it's a rush)
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night
And we still might
I should keep it to myself (to myself)
Can you tell I can't help it? (Can you tell?)
That I just wanna keep you to myself
