Song Name: Fuzzybrain
Pretty please
Where do I begin?
No, I don't understand it either
And I don't think I can
Fuzzy brain
Call it what you want
I've felt so distant lately
As if I were not
There's rain outside, steady winter
My heart feels like such a mixture
Shapeless, I stare at her picture
I don't know her but I miss her
Why, oh, why such things?
Write it down
Absent of the pen
The sun has been set for hours
And she's rising again
Scattered mind
I call it a friend
I wish I thought a bit less
And spoke up instead in my head
There's rain inside my skeleton frame
A hurricane within my rib cage
I never left but I never stayed
I'm cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
Time and time again
I never left but I never stayed
I'm cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
Time and time again
Oh, it's time and time again
