Song Name: HIDE
We on the road again it's just a couple miles to go
I can't be bothered by no other with my foot to the floor
I never ever got to measure what was better
But now I see I'm far away from home
(Far away from home)
It's like I want you, you look the other way and
You want me I'd rather run away and
Hide
Iiiiide
Maybe I'm stupid and you're messin' with me just for a laugh
(Just for a laugh)
But
Rather my head was in the clouds than stick my teeth in the grass
(Teeth in the grass)
So
I keep it movin' keep on cruisin' like I'm provin' to you
I'd only stop if you were to ask
(Stop if you were to ask)
It's like I want you, you look the other way and
You want me, I'd rather run away and
Hide
(Run away and hide)
(Mmmm)
I said I want you, you look the other way and
You want me, I'd rather run away and
Hide
Ooohhhhhh
I hit that backroad goin' 'bout one-twenty-five
That's the exact dose for one hell of a ride
For the night (Night)
Night (Night)
Night (Night)
Night (Night)
Without your face this the only way I'm feelin' alive
Another day without the brakes is all I need to keep me
Feelin' alright (Right)
Right (Right)
Riiiight
I'm keepin' focus all I know is every line on the road
(Line on the road)
Cause every time you in my mind is when I'm losin' control
(Losin' control)
You introducin' this confusion now I'm losin' my head
Maybe I'm dead I just don't know
(Dead I just don't know)
It's like I want you, you look the other way and
You want me, I'd rather run away and
Hide
(Run away and hide)
(Ooohhhhh)
I said I want you, you look the other way and
You want me I'd rather run away and
Hide
(Ooohhhh)
(Yeah yeah)
