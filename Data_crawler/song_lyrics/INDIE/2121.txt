Song Name: Stress Relief
I never thought you'd end up with me for long, baby
Not even quicksand could keep you here with me
I had you in my head, baby, every day
Towards the end, I just couldn't hear your name
It's stress relief from everything
It's stress relief from everything
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, won't you let me be myself?
I was holding on, but you didn't see my shots, baby
All the times that I couldn't speak my thoughts, well, maybe
Well, this is what I wanted, please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost, please don't come back
Yeah, this is what I wanted, please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost, please don't come back
It's stress relief from everything
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, won't you let me be myself?
Well, it's difficult, y'know, doing all this
But it got easier over time (when did you get your picture?)
But
Si puedes venir conmigo, amor
Yo te enseño todo lo que hay
¿Porque me tratas asi?
Como no soy nadie
Tell me you love me
Come back to haunt me
Won't you just let me be myself?
Tell me, tell me, tell me you, tell me you
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, won't you let me be myself?
