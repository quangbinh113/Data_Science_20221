Song Name: Lvr Boy
I used to get on my knees
And I'd pray for love
To come find me someday
For love to come meet me my way
Your love hit like a brick to the face
And when I put up a fight
You put me back in my place
I thought I wasn't cut out for this race
You know how I feel
You don't need a song
But just in case
You're my lvr boy
My stay in bed under the cover boy
My only you and no other boy
My face is red come smother me boy
'Cuz you're my lvr boy
Come on and meet my mother boy
You made me a lil tougher boy
My life was black and white
But now I see color boy
You're my lvr boy
I used to find things about me
That were wrong to me
But then you came along
And showed me
Showed me where I was wrong
So thank you
'Cuz now I'm where I belong
In a world where I finally feel strong
I got my boy and he can tag along
You know how I feel
You don't need a song
But just in case
You're my lvr boy
My stay in bed under the cover boy
My only you and no other boy
My face is red come smother me boy
'Cuz you're my lvr boy
Come on and meet my mother boy
You made me a lil tougher boy
My life was black and white
But now I see color boy
You're my lvr boy
You own my heart
You own my heart and it's no one elses
You own my heart
You own my heart and it's no one elses
I fall apart
And when I fall apart I'm no one elses
You own my heart
You own my heart like no one elses

I can be your baby
I could be your baby
I'm always your baby

Always yours
