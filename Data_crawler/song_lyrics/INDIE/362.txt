Song Name: I Love You More
You know that old clich√©d advice about relationships
Let the other person win all the arguments
Even when you're right, just bite your tongue
But I just can't let you win this one
I love you more
I love you more
I love you more
I love you more
Baby, there's no question
No competition
I love you more
