Song Name: North
I'm nervous, couldn't tell you why
Touching me, hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way?
Oh, and my body hasn't felt the same
Since you left my apartment
Think my pillows still have your scent
I just want to let you know
I'm seeing the sides that you don't show
And I know that we've got some potential
'Cause that look you gave me was so gentle
Do you think that you could stay?
I need more time, I need to get away from here
Pour my love out
Spill it all on the ground
Is it all in my head? What are you saying?
Usually I'd be fine, but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together, but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north

All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together, but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north
