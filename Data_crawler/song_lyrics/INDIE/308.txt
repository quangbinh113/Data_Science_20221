Song Name: Turn
It's your turn now
They left me waiting all alone
And I said they'd run
It's my fault now
'Cause they knew I'd give it up
And I said they'd run
I should go
I should leave
But you don't know
You're not asking me
I should go
But they won't learn
I'm told
It's my turn
Am I alone or is this
Me in the zone
Of my head again?
I don't care
I don't believe it
When they tell me
That it's alright, I'm overthinking things
My dear, I don't care
I should go
I should leave
But you don't know
You're not asking me
I should go
They won't learn
I'm told
It's my turn
It's my turn
I should go
I should leave
But you don't know
You're not asking me
I should go
They won't learn
I'm told
It's my turn
