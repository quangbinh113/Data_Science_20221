Song Name: Beg For You (feat. Rina Sawayama)
You know I go insane every time you have to catch a flight (ah, ah-ah, ah)
Can I take you to the airport? Make out under the bathroom lights (ah, ah-ah, ah)
Put your lips on my lips, I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss you, uh-uh
Something I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed, hmm-hmm-mmm
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay-ay-ay-ay
Don't make me beg for you ('cause I'll beg for you)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, yeah
Beg for you, beg for you (yeah)
Beg for you, beg for you, mmm (yeah)
Beg for you, beg for you (yeah)
So don't you leave me this way (yeah)
You're like an ocean breeze, coming and going just as you please (ah, ah-ah, ah)
Separated by a degree, hesitating, I'll lose you so far out of reach (ah, ah-ah, ah)
Oh, put your lips on my lips, I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss you, uh-uh
Something I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessing now-ow
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay-ay-ay-ay
Don't make me beg for you ('cause I'll beg for you)
My heart is aching, my breath, you've taken
I'll leave that, just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way-ay-ay-ay
Don't make me beg for you
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way-ay-ay-ay-ay
This way-ay-ay-ay-ay
This way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way-ay-ay-ay-ay
This way-ay-ay-ay-ay
This way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way-ay-ay-ay-ay (don't you leave me, yeah)
This way-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (don't you leave me this way, yeah)
This way (don't you leave me, yeah)
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way-ay-ay-ay-ay (don't you leave me, yeah)
This way-ay-ay-ay-ay (don't you leave me this way, yeah)
This way (don't you leave me, yeah)
Don't you leave me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
