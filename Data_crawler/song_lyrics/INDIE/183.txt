Song Name: If You Want To
If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die, die
If you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you can go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
If you wanted to

If you try to
Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started, take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die, die
'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you can go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to
If you wanted to
If you try to
'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you can go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to
