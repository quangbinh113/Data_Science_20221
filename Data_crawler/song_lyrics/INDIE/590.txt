Song Name: Pray
Heaven only knows when I'm in hell
None of my friends can even tell
I wanna fuckin' die but I never say it
Sick of gettin' high but I do the same shit
I can't even cry so I try to fake it
I hate it
I pray to God let me die in my sleep
I pray to God let me die in my sleep
You as sick as all the secrets you keep
But the truth is I don't wanna be me
I pray to God let me die in my sleep
Now I'm waking up and I'm not dead
Living off the words I know you said
I feel like I'm alive and I'm gonna make it
Maybe if I cry I don't have to fake it
I'm giving up my pain so you can take it
I hate it
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
I'm as sick as all the secrets I keep
But the truth is I can only be me
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
I pray to God I don't die in my sleep
And now I'm sick of all the secrets I keep
I pray to God let me die in my-
