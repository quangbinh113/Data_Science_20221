Song Name: wait
Wait, wait on me
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?
I thought we were somethin', baby
Are we, or are we nothin', baby?
'Cause yesterday was so chill and wavy
Today, you called me fucking crazy
That was so unnecessary
Got me feelin' blessed and buried
I'm no saint, you're no Mother Mary
But if we try, results may vary
I've been workin' through the weekends
So, you can sleep in through the seasons
You think that we're losing meanin'
And I think I know the reasons
I think the universe just tryna to test me
With weight on my plate that you stress me
I try to give you the best me
But just in case you find the next me
Don't you know that I would
Love to give my life for you?
If you let me, I would love to give my life to you
Will you wait, wait on me?
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe, no
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
Will you wait, wait on me?
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?
