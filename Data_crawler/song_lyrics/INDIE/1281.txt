Song Name: I Wish I Never Met You
Summer nights so serene
Fell apart at the seam
Said it felt like a dream
Yeah, I know what you mean
Trying to forget the seven minutes we had in heaven
Now at 11-11
I wish I knew forever would end so soon
I wish I never kissed you in my living room
You wonder how I'm doing well here's a clue
I wish I never met you
Mixing liquor and pot
Heard your brain cells can rot
If my memory was shot
I would like that a lot
Trying to forget the seven minutes we had in heaven
I got a little confession
I wish I knew forever would end so soon
I wish I never kissed you in my living room
You wonder how I'm doing well here's a clue
I wish I never met you
In an alternate reality
I pass you on the street
And our eyes don't meet
Texted and saw you read it
Lately I'm so pathetic
Dinner at 7:11
I wish I knew forever would end so soon
I wish I never kissed you in my living room
Whoever said it's better to love and lose
Never loved and lost you
I wish I could replace you with someone new
But then I'd have to wish I'd never met them too
You wonder how I'm doing well here's the truth
I wish I never met you
I wish I never
I, I wish I never
I, I wish I could forget you
I, I wish I never
I, I wish I never
I, I wish I never met you
