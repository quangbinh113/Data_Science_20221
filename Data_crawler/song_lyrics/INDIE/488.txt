Song Name: Nina Cried Power
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It is the groundin' of a foot uncompromisin'
It's not forgoin' of the lie, It's not the openin' of eyes
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It's not the shade we should be casting
It's the light, it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It's not the song, it is the singin'
It's the heaven of the human spirit ringin'
It is the bringin' of the line
It is the bearin' of the rhyme
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Lord!
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry power
Power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Lord!
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow men is near assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keepin' the divide
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Lord!
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry power
Power (power)
Power (power)
Power
Billy cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to rattle your chains
If you love bein' free
Ah, Lord, I could cry power
Power (power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Millie cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power
