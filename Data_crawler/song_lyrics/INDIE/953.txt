Song Name: Still Don't Know My Name
I took your heart
I did things to you
Only lovers would do in the dark
Made you a God
Pre-spokes and pre-shows
Will tell me what I did wrong
But hey
You made a nigga flip
What do I say
To make me exist?
Ooh, stranger
Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die or stay
For you right now
But you still don't know my name
Yeah
Wish you, wish you'd come over
Missed you, kissed you and make-believe

I'm dreamin' of all the possibilities
I'm kissing all over your body, my Nefertiti
And every time I think the plan is aligning
You still so close yet so far
Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die or stay
For you right now
But you still don't know my name
Yeah
