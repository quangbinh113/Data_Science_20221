Song Name: Seaface
I saw a flock of blackbirds
I saw a flock of blackbirds
Look down at me
Evil beady eyes and sharp beaks
I don't trust those stupid little beasts
They look like they want something
Deep inside that I can't reach
Crumple my fingers into fists
And keep them in my pockets
So I don't lose my thumbs
I'll keep my head down and my hood up
So I don't lose my nose
Keep my shoulders steady and my chin upturned
So I look like I belong
I'll eat the food you give me but I won't like it
I'll talk to you about things and you'll put a gun near my face
But I won't mind it
Say what you want about me
See what you wanna see
You can cry and you can scream
But I've been through this too many times
To care about how you feel
I can fend for myself while you listen to the crows
Watch them peck out your eyes and take your soul
And claim you as their own
As their own
As their own
Watch them peck out your eyes and take your soul
And claim you as their own
Businessmen with their tall coats and pockets
Can be your friends
Just tell them what they wanna hear
Animals sell you a story in exchange for some years of time
Pick what you wanna be
It can be anything
If you close your eyes
It's fun to imagine
Another body, another life
Say what you want about me
See what you wanna see
You can cry and you can scream
But I've been through this too many times
To care about how you feel
I can fend for myself while you listen to the crows
Watch them peck out your eyes and take your soul
Watch them peck out your eyes and take your soul
Claim you as their own
As their own
As their own
Watch them peck out your eyes and take your soul
And claim you as their own
As their own
As their own
As their own
