Song Name: All I Think About Now
I try to think about tomorrow
But I always think about the past
About the things that didn't last
If I could go to the beginning
Then for sure I would be another way
Make it better for today
If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way
Make it better for today
Remember when we were happy?
If I'm late, can I thank you now?
I'm gonna try anyhow
I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now
That's all I think about now
I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now
If you have any doubt
I want to thank you anyhow
