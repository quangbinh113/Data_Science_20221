Song Name: adios
We were sitting on your bed cross legged in your head
You were talking to me so slow
So slow
When you put your pretty red lipstick on a cigarette
And I starting thinking oh, no
Oh, no
Come a little closer
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout
New York City grid max out
When she said, "adios"
Adios
I was thinking something sweet but you wouldn't let me speak
And in my head I'm thinking oh, no
Don't go
Feeling bluer than your jeans belt buckle to my knees
High waisted self esteem, I know
I know
Come a little closer
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout
New York City grid max out
When she said, "adios"
Adios
Come a little closer
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, she don't want my love
Come a little closer
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, she don't want my love
Come a little closer (so come a little closer)
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout
New York city grid max out
When she said, "adios"
Adios
Come a little closer (so come a little closer)
Come a little closer
She don't want my, she don't want my love
Adios
