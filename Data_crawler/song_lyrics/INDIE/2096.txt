Song Name: Today
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Some days, the pain still stays
Makes you feel, helplessness
Time again, away from friends
Isolation, settles in
Some day we'll be good, I pray
But how far away is some day?
Some days, I make mistakes
Countless talkin' about myself
Time again, I stay away
Much confusion, settles in, oh
Some days, I fall
But I will press towards the future one day
It gets hard for me to breathe
It gets hard for me to breathe
In a world where I cannot see (oh, ah)
What is wrong with me
Lord, help me
Some days, I makе the same mistakes
It gеts complicated when we
When it lost to feel a thing
Then I just roll my hands
Since that makes me aware
Of everything that makes me numb
And I just hold it in my chest
But will I ever get a time
When I'll be alright to be all by myself?
Oh my, my, my
Some days I let it be
But I'm underneath my sheets cryin' out (out, yeah, cryin')
Constant pressure
But I rest on for the future some day
Ah, ah, ah
Constant anger
But I rest on for the future one day
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, constant anxious
But I rest on for the future one day
And I pray that day will come today
