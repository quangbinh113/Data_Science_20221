Song Name: midnight sun
I remember everything
So I can't take back anything
Unless that's how I'm meant to feel
Find myself a better deal
So maybe
I better tie this up
I bet it all goes wrong
Do what they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
I know when it's not okay
Can't keep my head down
Don't like whenever I'm not in pain
Peeling back not noticing
The blood and bones beneath my skin
Feelings that we can't compare
Taking chances anywhere
So maybe
I can't care too much
I can't clean this up
Just do what they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
I know when it's not okay
Can't keep my head down
Don't like
Whenever I'm not in pain
Whenever I try complain
To you we are all the same
Can't keep my mouth shut this time
Is that what they say, say, say
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine
You're my midnight sun
Always I did it for you
I remembered every line
If we go through it one more time
So show me how to split the real
Get me off this spinning wheel
So baby
I better turn this up
I hope it drowns you out
Is that what they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
It's that why it's so mundane
Can't keep my eyes closed too long
Whenever I'm not in pain
Whenever I try explain
To you we are not the same
Can't keep my hands up far from
Is that what they say, say, say
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine
You're my midnight sun
Always I did it for you
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine
You're my midnight sun
Always I did it for you
