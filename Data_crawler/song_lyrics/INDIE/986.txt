Song Name: Wine & Dine
You got me feelin' nervous
You and your curves and
Beauty imperfect
That's why you're so perfect to me
And your angles
You really know your angles
I seen that on the gram now
I might be in love now
All I need is Monday
To see you on Tuesday
Treat you on a Wednesday
Take you out on Thursday
Take you home Friday
We can make love on a weekend too
No typical 9-5
Everyday wine and dine￼
Everyday wine and dine girl
Wine and dine
Wine and dine girl
Everyday everyday wine and dine girl
Wine and dine
Wine and dine girl
I can get I can get selfish
And a little jealous
But you know where my heart is
Stay humble and modest
You know what the vibes is
Take it straight down to West LA
Sippin' on Chardonnay
Malibu getaway
I know you 'bout to settle down
Say you moving out of town
Not sayin' he don't love you
But he don't love you like I do
I know you committed
Loyalty driven
But would you mind giving me a chance on you
All I need is Monday
To see you on Tuesday
Treat you on a Wednesday
Take you out on Thursday
Take you home Friday
We can make love on a weekend too
No typical 9-5
Everyday wine and dine￼
Everyday wine and dine girl
Wine and dine
Wine and dine girl
Everyday everyday wine and dine girl
Wine and dine
Wine and dine girl
Everyday wine and dine girl
Wine and dine
Wine and dine girl
