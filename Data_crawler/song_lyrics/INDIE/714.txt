Song Name: Isabelle
Yeah-yeah, oh-oh
Silk sheets and neon lights
Stayed up 'til four or five
Think that it's kinda nice
Underneath the moon 'til the sun arrives, yeah
Strummed songs on your guitar
Drove 'round in your jet black car
Got lost went too far, went too far
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Everything just seemed so real
Can't lie 'bout the way I feel
Might be head over heels, head over heels
Three nights, no drama
Yeah, you're like no other, yeah
So girl do you wanna? (Do you wanna?)
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
