Song Name: Life Moves On
She said, "you always had a way with people"
A way of letting them leave
My hands could be the church to your fingers' steeple
But you talk so mean
She said, you know I love you
I said "remind me"
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other love, gave each other love
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other love, love and broken arms
Her silhouette glowed so familiar through
That blood-red curtain
I stood with strangers, gazing
At the girl that I once knew
But I've grown uncertain
She said, "It's just a bad dream"
But she looked too happy
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other love, gave each other love
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other love, love
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other love, love
Life moves on, the way life does
But some things are prettier the way life was
Before we gave each other up
