Song Name: Psycho, Pt. 2
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightropes
She got me going down, down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down, down, down
Oh no, you lie
I want to, so I
Might call you tonight if I do pick up
I got some Gin in me
A hundred bands on me
I'm feelin' myself, yeah
I might say too much
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down, down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down, down, down
I don't know you but I know that you special
Fuck a verse, fuck a hook I'll use the whole instrumental
Just to reiterate the commitment I have to explore
I like would you ride it like a horse like my last name is Lauren
I'm only interested
Baby I'm infatuated
You been held back I'll get you to graduation
Help you with your cash
Stay you clear of tax evasion
Death grip on your ass
I call that assassination
I'm getting carried away
Let's get married today, fuck
Here I go again like Whitesnake back in the day
I'm crazy and you crazy too
But I love that shit
You're bad and you're broken too
But I love that shit
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash now I want you
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down, down, down
She got me going psycho
She got me going down, down, down
Got me living on a tightrope
She got me going down, down, down
She got me going psycho
