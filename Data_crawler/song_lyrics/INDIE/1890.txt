Song Name: at least, I tried
Tonight i'm not sleeping
My mind is not healing but
I tried to change my feelings
My heart can't be reasoned hurt
But i tried
I tried
At least i tried
But i tried
I tried
At least i tried
Tonight i'm not breathing
My heart can't stop beating love
I thought of every reason
But i can't still believe it hurts
But i tried
I tried
At least i tried
But i tried
I tried
At least i tried
Tonight i'm not leaving
My mind is not healing but
I tried to change my feelings
My heart can't be reasoned hurt
My heart can't be reasoned hurt
