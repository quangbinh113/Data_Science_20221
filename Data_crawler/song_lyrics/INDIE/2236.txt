Song Name: Even True Love
Try not to see it as a curse
You think that things are getting worse
The only body I was given
The only life that you're living
Even true love
You can't take it with you
Even true love
You can't, you can't
What you had all along and what you pick
In the deepest wells, in the shallow sick
I can see you shaking in the great unknown
Will you learn to live with what you chose?
Even true love
You can't take it with you
Even true love
You can't, you can't
Even true love
You can't take it with you
Even true love
You can't, you can't
It's nothing but the pull of going under
Maybe you can't know, but you can wonder
You had the kindest eyes when you were younger
But it's nothing now
Even true love
You can't take it with you
Even true love
You can't, you can't
Even true love
You can't take it with you
Even true love
You can't, you can't
