Song Name: Wolf
I'm hungry like a wolf
I bleed like a wolf
I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell
Taste for hell
Taste for hell (mm-mmh, mm-mmh)
I'm haunted like a wolf
I feed, I feed like a wolf
I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell
Taste for hell
Taste for hell, oh, oh
Into the wild with me
Into the wild
Into the wild with me
Into the wild with me
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild, into the wild
