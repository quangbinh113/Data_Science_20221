Song Name: Complicated
Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talking to me one on one
But you've become
Somebody else 'round everyone else
Watching your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty, you promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are ain't where it's at you see, you're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not fooling anyone
When you become
Somebody else 'round everyone else
Watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty, you promised me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no no
No, no no
No, no no
No, no no
No, no, no
