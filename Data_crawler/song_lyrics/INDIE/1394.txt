Song Name: Working for the Knife
I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife
I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys
I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife
I used to think I'd be done by 20
Now at 29, the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at 30 I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife
I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right, but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife
