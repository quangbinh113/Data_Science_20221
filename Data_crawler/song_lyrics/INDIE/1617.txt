Song Name: This Charming Man - 2011 Remaster
Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

This man said, it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, return the rings
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care
This charming man
This charming man
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, return the ring
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
