Song Name: Karma
I hope you choke on every lie you said to me
I hope you move out of this city suddenly
I hope you get everything you deserve
Karma's a bitch, I heard
I hope your new man gives you something that you can't get rid of
I know you're missing all the things that you said you were sick of
And now you'll never come around me
I know you wish you'd never found me
But now you're stuck inside a world that you hate
I hope you choke on every lie you said to me
I hopе you move out of this city suddenly
I hope you gеt everything you deserve
Karma's a bitch, I heard
What goes around
Comes around
I hope you get everything you deserve (you deserve)
Karma's a bitch, I heard

I wrote down all of the things I miss
And your name's the first one on that list
I crossed it off, XOXO
I'm over my ex (Are you really, though?)
I hope you choke on every lie you said to me
I hope you move out of this city suddenly
I hope you get everything you deserve
Karma's a bitch, I heard
What goes around (what goes around)
Comes around
I hope you get everything you deserve
Karma's a bitch, I heard
What goes around (what goes around)
Comes around (comes around)
I hope you get everything you deserve (you deserve)
Karma's a bitch, I heard
