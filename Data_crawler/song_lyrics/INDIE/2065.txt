Song Name: I Follow You
I was wrong and you were cold
I was hoping you might go
You never showed me how
Much you cared or what was going on
I follow you
Pretend you want me to
Living a test
Locked up with you
I thought you trust me enough
Then I do stupid things
The things I always do
This time with you
Our love is new
It's been too long since you are gone
I am thinking of you alone
You never showed me how
Much you scared of what was going on
I follow you
Pretend you need me too
Living a test
Locked up with you
I thought you trust me enough
But I do stupid things
The things I always do
This time with you
Our love is new
I need someone
To be close remember
My own demons
Sneak under my pillow
Not someone (I just need you)
That comes and goes wherever (But I don't want you)
I need you here (You don't need me)
Stay and show me your love (I just want you)
