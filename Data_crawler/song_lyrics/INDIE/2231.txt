Song Name: Two Step
I'm wanting
Oh, I'm wanting for our time again
Wanting to be your friend
But I'm running
Yes, I'm running from the past again
Wanting it all to end
I-I should accelerate
But why, I'm two steps from your home?
I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there when you arrive again
And hoping it's all pretend
But I can't see you
I can't know that time again
I seem friendly, accidentally oh
I-I should accelerate
But why-why, I'm two steps from your home?
