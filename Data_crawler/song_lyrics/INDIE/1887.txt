Can I say when I go?
Can I say when I go?
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Can I say when I go?
Can I say when I go?
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
Bury me out, I'm not scared
I met the man, he told me what he'd say
He said he'd take on all my sin and walk it all away
I met the man, he told me what he'd say
He said he'd take on all my sin and walk it all away
I met the man, he told me what he'd say
He said hе'd take on all my sin and walk it all away
I met the man, hе told me what he'd say
He said he'd take on all my sin and walk it all away
All away
(All away)
All away
All away, all away, all away
