Song Name: Not Warriors
We tore our phones to shreds
We didn't answer nothing
To all friends and family: lost or dead
I couldn't get much sleep
You lost yourself in mine
It couldn't get much worse
Than the best time of life
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you
I'm sweating out potential
But I'm nervous at my central for you
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you

There's nothing left to miss
Except the shots I take and phone calls with you
And I just need you to feel it too
Our residence is in this bed
All I want's The Office
And what's awful is
Don't think like that
You couldn't get much sleep
I found you just in time
But hey, for what it's worth
I think you saved my life
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you

I'm sweating out potential
But I'm nervous at my central for you

There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you
There's nothing left to miss
Except the shots I take and phone calls with you
And I just need you to feel it too
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I think I'll die obsessed
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Let's give up fighting back
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You don't need to grip the best (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Because we're lucky people
And you'll never have to sleep alone
I couldn't get much sleep
I found you just in time
I couldn't get much sleep
I found you just in time
Hey, for what it's worth
I think you saved my life
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you
I'm sweating out potential
But I'm nervous at my central for you
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you
(There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you)
There's nothing left to miss
Except the shots I take and phone calls with you
(There's nothing left to miss
Except the shots I take and phone calls with you)
And I just need you to feel it too
(I'm sweating out potential
But I'm nervous at my central for you)
And I just need you to feel it too
