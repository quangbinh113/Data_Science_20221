Song Name: Girl I Met On The Internet
We're the cool teens, we look good in i-D magazine
Desperately trying to make life more exciting
You got the come out nows, and the too shy gals
The prom queens and the foreign pen pals, so...
Dad don't tell me what to do
I promise one day I'll make it up to you
And when mum asks "Where you been?"
I say "Please leave me alone, I'm 17"
I want someone I can call at 2am
While I've got that restless feeling again
Just wanna jump the gates of a closed park
Drink beer all night and have a laugh
I wanna have a cute chick on my arm
And make the boys swoon and the girls all gasp
And when my mum asks where we met
I'll say it's just this girl that I met on the internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet, oh (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet
I feel all aggy and I wanna waste time
Tryin' to fight the feeling that I wanna run and hide
I know school's a bore life feels like a chore
Scared that you're boring
'Cause you saw Snapchats of you snoring
But crying doesn't help your problems
And bunking at the bus or the train won't solve them
I spend my whole life putting up with people's shit
Because I need them
I love you but I'm seething, I'm grieving, heaving
It's easy to be cool if you're hot
Wear too much makeup and be called a thot
Posing with surgical masks
Polaroid cameras and giving ourselves tasks
Go grab that girls ass, touch it up and call it art
Be polite don't burp or fart
I'm just a desperate bitch
A snitch with a cute chick itch
I want someone I can call at 2am
While I've got that restless feeling again
Just wanna jump the gates of a closed park
Drink beer all night and have a laugh
I wanna have a cute chick on my arm
And make the boys swoon and the girls all gasp
And when my mum asks where we met
I'll say it's just this girl that I met on the internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet, oh (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet
It'll happen like it does in the shows
I'll like her eyes and she'll like my clothes
Ask her for her digits and I'll start to sweat
She'll become the girl that I met on the internet
I bet she'll be a spice
Forget butterflies, she'll give me beehives
That couple in the corner, I ought to warn her
She's gonna be the girl that I met on the internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet, oh (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet
The internet (La, la, la...)
The internet (La, la, la...)
She's just this girl that I met on the internet
(La, la, la...)
