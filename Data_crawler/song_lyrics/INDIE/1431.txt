Song Name: Coming Back (feat. SZA)
Can't stick to that
Can't fade us to black
So I'm coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back
'Cause it hurts, 'cause it hurts, like the end of the world
And like the trail, like the trail of the soul I've never thought of before
So I'm coming back, coming back, tail between my legs
Forget what I said, what I said, what I said, what I said
There's a mile between my heart and my head
So I take it all, take it all, take it all back
You shut down
Showed how you bring me down
Don't you have a clue 'bout where my mind is right now?
You say you love me, is it real?
But do you fantasize about the things you really wanna feel?
I know you fantasize about the life you really want to build
Know your eyes are watching God, baby, my eyes are hidden in the hills
Your first mistake was wanting me when you know I wasn't ready
You put that shit down heavy, couldn't let you regret me
Remember lies around the time we spent when you first met me
I put my shit down heavy, couldn't let you forget me, mm-mm (no, no!)
Will never let you forget me
I wish I could take it
Yes, I love you and it's real
I went in too soon for the kill
But I really want to feel
And I think I want to build with you (I wish I could take it)
I couldn't let you reject me (no), I couldn't let you forget me (no)
I wanted you to respect me (I wish I could take it)
I wanted you to let me in
So I'm coming back, coming back, tail between my legs
Forget what I said, what I said, what I said, what I said
There's a mile between my heart and my head
So I take it all, take it all, take it all back
(I wish, I)
I wish I could take it
(I wish, same...)
I wish I could take it all
You say you love me, is it real?
(Coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back)
But do you fantasize about the things you really want to feel?
I know you fantasize about the life you really want to build
Know your eyes are watching God, baby, my eyes are hidden in the hills
