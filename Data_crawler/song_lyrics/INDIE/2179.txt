Song Name: Chinatown (feat. Bruce Springsteen)
Get in my backseat, honeypie
And I'll wear your sadness like it's mine
Because it's just good to have what was missing
It's just bad to be bad to always be missing
But a girl like you
Could rip me out of my head
Black tears on your cheek
I want them in my bed
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow
With a girl like you
My Chinatown lady
Sittin' on the front stoop
Cryin' out the crazy
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
'Cause, I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow
With you, baby
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that big red light
And please take the sadness out of Saturday night
'Cause that's just good to have what was missing
We were bad to be bad to always be missing
But a girl like you
Could rip me out of my head
Black tears on your cheek
I want them in my bed
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow
With a girl like you
My Chinatown baby
Sittin' on your front stoop
Cryin' out the crazy
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow with you, baby
I wanna run
I wanna run
I love to chase every feeling
I wanna run
I wanna run
I wanna run
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow
Tomorrow with you, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
