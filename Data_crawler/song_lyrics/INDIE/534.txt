Song Name: Youuu
I know your heart
And I know your downfall
Though we fell apart
It was no one's fault
I've gotta make you remember
How hard it was to let me go
Slow dancing with a stranger
But I found somebody new
She moves just like you
And she tastes just like you
But it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Yeah, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Back when we started
I was a fighter
I kept my guard up
But I took it down for you
Oh, what a thing to do
What do you tell your friends?
The ones I'll never see again
What are you filling in their heads?
I found another ex
Some temporary settlement
To kiss the heartbreak off my lips
She moves just like you
And she tastes like you
But it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Yeah, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Don't let go
If you love me
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't let go
If you love me
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't move on, don't move on
