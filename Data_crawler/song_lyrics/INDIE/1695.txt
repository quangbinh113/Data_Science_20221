Song Name: Too Easy
Maybe I should just let go
And take somebody home
So I can fuck it up with you
Maybe I've been so alone
That I do not know how to cope
So I take it out on you
Too many reasons
To stay or go
But I like me better
When on my own
Don't nobody want no body to buddy up too easy
And I don't ever want nobody just to fuck and please me
Too easy
I'll put myself down
So I don't waste my life away
Loving someone who doesn't care
I'll take advantage of you
And all of the kindness you give
Cause I don't know what else to do
Too many reasons
To stay or go
But I like me better
When on my own
Don't nobody want no body to buddy up too easy
And I don't ever want nobody just to fuck and please me
Don't nobody want no body to buddy up too easy
And I don't ever want nobody just to fuck and please me
Too easy
Too easy
