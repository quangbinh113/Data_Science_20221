Song Name: Borderline
Ah
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiving
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (on the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing

Do you see the light, oh
Coming from horizon, oh
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can (just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't running dry
Conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
