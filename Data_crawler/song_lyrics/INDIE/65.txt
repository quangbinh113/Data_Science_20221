Song Name: Listen to Your Friends
Don't call me out, 'cause I heard you scream
I don't wanna get out of bed for this again
I won't waste your time, I heard it in a dream
I don't believe you trusted me
Trusted me
I bet you only listen to your friends
I'm talking like I can pretend
But I feel better when
You tell me that I always have to go
You tell me what I want to know
And I'll feel better for it
I know sometimes it's hard for me to say
I love you every other day
You pour my heart away
And sometimes I'm scared of what they've done
So I look how far we've come
You think you don't have to put up a fight, but you might as well
So I tell you everything you won't admit
Tell me you don't care one bit
And I'll feel better for it
Look online
Do ten minutes of research and in turn find
The problem is poor kids who want holidays in term time
The problem is poor kids who can't afford the train fare
So we up the train fare and charge them for not paying the train fare
The problem is welfare
And the problem is free healthcare
'Cause it's unfair and if it's gone it's welfare
The problem is drugs
The problem is free love and free hugs
So stay in fear
Do some drugs and stay here
Well I said go on then!
But God bless the weatherman
Who has gone out of business since the psychoactive substance ban
The gateway has sent him back
From bulk-buying NOS to selling crack
The problem rose and a rich man suggested it
Over his lunchtime snack
So we ban the produce and its a bit of a nuisance really
"Don't waste your time", I heard you scream
I don't wanna get out of bed today, okay?
I won't waste your time, I heard it in a dream
I don't believe you trusted me
Trusted me
Please trust in me
Please trust in me
