Song Name: Kangaroo - Remastered
I first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide anything
I saw you leaving
And I saw you staring out in space
I next saw you, it was at a party
Thought you was uncool, oh so flirty
I came again
You didn't say excuse
You knew what I was doing
You looked very fine, as we were leaving
Like Saint Joan, doing a cool, cool jerk
Oh I want you, Oh I want you
Like a kangaroo
