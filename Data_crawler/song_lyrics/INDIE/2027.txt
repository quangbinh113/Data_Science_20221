Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up everytime
Everyone, ooh
Pulls away, ooh
From you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Got balls of steel, got an automobile for a minimum wage
Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up everytime
Everyone, ooh
Pulls away, ooh
It's a mechanical bull, at number one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride
Pulls away
Ooh ooh
From you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
