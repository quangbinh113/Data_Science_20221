Song Name: Dope on a Rope
Dope in the wash, strangers in bed
Dead-end nights make a heart beat half dead
In the mirror, striking a pose
Conjured up glamour in a school play rock show
Guess it doesn't last forever, just a feeling to remember
Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk's a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again
Generations change
In a blink the fad's extinct
Find your lover or you'll flash the fame
Before you wake up from your dream
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Collect taxidermy fist
Smudges on your wrists
New friends flood the list 'till you're sick
Trying to have a ball in a tagged-up stall
Numb when it's from making sense of it all
I guess it doesn't last forever
Just the feeling to remember
Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk's a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again
Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk's a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again
Generations change
In a blink, the fad's extinct
Find your lover or flash the fame
Before you wake up from your dream
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless time
