Song Name: Real Thing
I'm so sick of thinking, staying up at night
I don't wanna play around, that ain't on my mind
When I think of other faces, problems don't exist
But if I'm being honest with you
I'm tired of that fantasy, I'm tired of the daydream
Tired of just waiting to fall asleep to see you
I know it's imaginary but I think my mind is ready
Need to leave this sanctuary for something true
I just want the real thing
I just want the real thing
I want more than fights, you know
I want more than tears
I want more than conversations, tell me all your fears
'Cause I know that it's hard for you to trust
No one's ever given you enough
I might need to stop and give it up, eh
I'm tired of that fantasy, I'm tired of the daydream
Tired of just waiting to fall asleep to see you (Oh)
I know it's imaginary but I think my mind is ready
Need to leave this sanctuary for something true
I just want the real thing
I just want the real thing
I just want the real thing
(I don't wanna think
I don't wanna live in fantasy)
Real thing
(I just want you here
I just want you in reality)
I just want the real, mmh, real thing
I just want the real thing, oh-oh (Ay)
I just want the real, the real thing
(I don't wanna think
I don't wanna live in fantasy)
I just want the real thing
(I just want you here
I just want you in reality)
I just want you here
I just want you in reality
Real thing (Oh)
