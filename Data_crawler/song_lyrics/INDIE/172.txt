Song Name: Silly Girl
One, two, three, four
Flowers bloomed when he walked
Angels sang when he talked
I laid my head down on my pillow and I dreamed
'Cause I'm just a silly girl in a stupid dumb old world
I'm just a silly girl in a stupid dumb old world
And he is perfect
'Cause he's supposed to be
Smile at him in your math class
Strive for him to do the same
Open your eyes and realize he does not know your name
And he does not care to
'Cause I'm just a silly girl in a stupid dumb old world
I'm just a silly girl in a stupid dumb old world
And he is perfect
Unlike me
And how could I ever think that it was meant to be
And how could I ever think that anything was made for me
'Cause I'm just a silly girl in a stupid dumb old world
I'm just a silly girl in my stupid dumb old world
And he was perfect
He was supposed to be
I made him perfect
'Cause I wanted him to be
