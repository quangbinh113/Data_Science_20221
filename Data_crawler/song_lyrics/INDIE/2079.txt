Song Name: Echo's Answer
The wind has gone
The invisible come
Your memories are being run
The mountain scarred
By invisible bars
The stillness is on guard
Oh, the wind will come
Blow, answer echo's answer
The mountain mine
From invisible time
I am next in line
The message sent
Was of discontent
From incline to incline
Oh, the wind will come
Blow, answer echo's answer
The wind is near
The invisible hear
Come my thoughts away from fear
Oh, the wind will come
Blow, answer all these echo's
