Song Name: Think About U (feat. Joji)
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
Ya, I dream about you girl when he sleeps
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
When I sleep, when I sleep
I'm way too lonely
I'm way too low
Forever
You're way too lonely
I'm way too low oh, no, no
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
Ya, I dream about you girl when he sleeps
Ya, I think about you girl when I sleep
When I sleep, when I sleep
I'm way too lonely
I'm way too low
I'm way too lonely
You're way too low
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
