Song Name: Nobody's Fault
Hey, it's nobody's fault
We're getting old
And time keeps pushing on
To the end of the road, my darling
Hey, what can you say?
It's better this way
It's time to sing your song
So I'm letting you go, my darling
Wait 'til it's over (wait 'til it's over)
Wait 'til it's done ('til it's done, done, done, done)
No more talking (no more talking)
Nowhere to run (got nowhere to run)
Wait 'til it's over (wait 'til it's over)
Wait 'til it's gone ('til it's gone, gone, gone, gone)
No more talking (no more talking)
It's all said and done (said and done)
Hey, I understand
It's not the end
This life's not what you wanted
And we all got to grow, my darling
Hey, it's nobody's fault
We're getting old
And time keeps pushing on
To the end of the road, my darling
Wait 'til it's over (wait 'til it's over)
Wait 'til it's done ('til it's done, done, done, done)
No more talking (no more talking)
Nowhere to run (got nowhere to run)
Wait 'til it's over (wait 'til it's over)
Wait 'til it's gone ('til it's gone, gone, gone, gone)
No more talking (no more talking)
It's all said and done (said and done)
