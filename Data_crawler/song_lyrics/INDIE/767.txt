Song Name: Average
Average
Like I've never heard that one before
See, that one stupid word is why I don't act anymore
One bad review from someone you love
And suddenly it doesn't matter who thinks you're above average
And so you stick to writing nothing else
If you never show off, your only critic is yourself
But now I've learned that I'm not the best
So if you need a failure, you can ask where the nearest is
I'll say, "Look no further than your favourite lyricist"
Me, the kid waking up from a dream
Realising his music is the worst he's ever seen
And who cares if it was from when he was 15?
It deserves the same judgement
It deserves the same judgement
God, it's so hard to be good for your age
When you know that your work's not good enough for the stage
You got the skills of an idiot who got too much praise
And your whole damn career just turns into a phase
And the fire in your heart is beginning to fade
And you're one critique away from considering trading your piano for money
Isn't it funny
How average can cut so deep?
