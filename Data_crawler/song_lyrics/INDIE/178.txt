Song Name: See Thru
Didn't take it
Like I wanted to
I am see through
But can't see through you
And I don't know
What you want to do
I won't tell the truth
When I'm talking to you
But I'll try so
Hard to make you smile
Haven't seen you smile
In a little while
Didn't take it
Like I wanted to
I am see through
But can't see through you
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting
Waiting for you
To tell you like I needed to
It's a good thing I am see through
And I don't know
What you want to do
Now I'll tell the truth
Without talking to you
But I'll try so
Hard to make you smile
Havent seen you smile
In a little while
Didn't tell you like I needed to
It's a good thing
I am see through
And I'm only
Blowing smokes a lot
When you're in your head
For the whole night
And I'm only
Taking them away
And out of your cells
So you stay here
Didn't take it
Like I wanted to
I am see through
But can't see through you
