Song Name: Touch
I missed you and I cried, but I said that I was alright
And I know it's been awhile since I needed a distraction
Because I want to do everything that you want me to
To tell you the truth
I need to stay alive, so sad that I could die
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely because it's not enough
Missing you only ever since we fell in love
And I watched you do a line that you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired, I just want to see you upside down
Because I want to do everything that you want me to
To tell you the truth
I listened to you cry all night through the telephone...
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely because it's not enough
Missing you only ever since we fell in love
Couldn't say you didn't want me then when we were
Lying in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person as if suddenly
You wanted to just be friends
I was hurt and so I took a shower so you couldn't hear
Me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking you were
Sleeping or just faking...
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely because it's not enough
Missing you only ever since we fell in love
