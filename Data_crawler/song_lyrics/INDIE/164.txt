Song Name: Safe and Sound
I dread that feeling of, oh, so low
So empty, broken, I'm never home
To keep us smiling, or keep us safe
Let's not go back to that horrid place where
I would cry and you would too
Neither one of us would know what to do
So just stay right here safe and sound
So just stay right here safe and sound
If we'll hold tight for just one second more
We can win this fight, we will beat this storm
And everything we've ever had will make sense
So hold my hand and love me true
The games we play will make us confused but will
Keep us safe and sound
So just stay right here safe and sound
So just stay right here safe and sound
Oh no oh-oh, oh no oh-oh
And we will talk and we will fight and we will stay up all night keeping on loving life
And we will talk and we will fight and we will stay up all night keeping on loving life
And we will talk and we will fight and we will stay up all night keeping on loving life
So just stay right here safe and sound
So just stay right here safe and sound
Oh no oh-oh, safe and, safe and sound
Oh no oh-oh, safe and sound (safe and sound)
