Song Name: Greyhound
Going to Seattle on the Greyhound
I missed school for this
Bought two tickets last September
Before your harmful bliss
Playin' at the Neptune
They were your favourite
I still can't believe you're gone
Can't get you to explain it, ah ah
I wish I could go home, forget this ever happened
I feel depressed, out of whack, and in my own world
Sometimes I can't feel a thing
I can barely feel a thing, ah ah
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
At the show
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ah-ah
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
But now it blows
It ruled your world
You lost the battle
It broke my heart in half
When I heard the bottles rattle
I know you wanted to be here
But now you're gone
I'll be thinking of you
When the lights come on, ah ah
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
But now it blows
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
