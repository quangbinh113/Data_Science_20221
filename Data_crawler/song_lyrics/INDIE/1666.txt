Song Name: Cough Syrup
Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control-oh-ol, oh-ol
These fishes in the sea they're staring at me, oh-whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa-oh
If I could find a way to see this sane, I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa-oh-oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
These zombies in the park they're looking for my heart, oh-whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun, oh, whoa-oh
If I could find a way to see this straight, I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control-oh-ol, oh-ol
If I could find a way to see this straight, I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh-whoa
One more spoon of cough syrup now, whoa, whoa
