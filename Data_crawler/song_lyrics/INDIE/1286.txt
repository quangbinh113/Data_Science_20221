Song Name: Teen Age Riot (Album Version)
You're it
No, you're it
Hey, you're really it
You're it
No, I mean it, you're it
Say it
Don't spray it
(Spirit desire)
Face me
(Spirit desire)
Don't displace me
(Spirit desire)
We will fall
Miss me
Don't dismiss me
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man do to but work out whether it's true
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two
Time to get it, before you let it get to you
Here he comes now, stick to your guns and let him through
Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue
Ah, here it comes, I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hyper nation for you
Now I see it, I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not clear why you make the away
Looking for a ride to a secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation, for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do for now
It better work out, I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city ahead
It takes a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now
You better look it, we're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand
We know it's down, we know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is 'round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze
It's time to go 'round, a one man showdown, teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now and back on the road, on the riot trail
