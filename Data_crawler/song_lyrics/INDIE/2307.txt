Song Name: Idea of Her
Can't get your name past my lips like a slur
And I think I'm in love with the idea of her
Lie in the morning aurora
What time is it in California?
Throwing up brains through my mouth
Yeah, I'm thinkin' out loud things we won't talk about
Remember the time that we snuck in her house?
They don't want me around
But I can't get your name past my lips like a slur
And I think I'm in love with the idea of her
Cried like annoying cicada
What time is it in California?
GMT minus eight and I'm stayin' up late
With your face in my head like a drone
If I don't want anyone, then why do I feel so alone?
I'll reach out if you don't
'Cause I can't get your name past my lips like a slur
And I think I'm in lov–µ with the idea of her
Lie in the morning aurora
What time is it in California?
Can't get your name past my lips like a slur
And I think I'm in love with the idea of her
Cried like annoying cicada
What time is it in California?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
