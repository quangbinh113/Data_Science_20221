Song Name: Physical
Now that the years have gone
All along too fast
I know I will be remembered well
Now that my time has come
Rushing towards the fast
I know I will be remembered well
But in all, I don't have a care in the world
I bet it all for you
I would have lost my share, I've killed and spared
But it's all so physical
And it's all so physical
Even if I've lost, you know I'll be there again
'Cause it's all so physical
Now that the party's done
No one sticks around
I know I will be remembered wеll
Now that the glamour's past
And everyonе's come down
I know I will be remembered well
But tonight I don't have a care
Boys or girls, I've heard it all before
I would have lost some wars
And I know I will never let myself down
'Cause it's all so physical
'Cause it's all so physical
Even if I've lost (I've lost)
You know (you know), I know
I'll meet you again
'Cause it's all so physical
