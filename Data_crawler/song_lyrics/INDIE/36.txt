Song Name: feelings are fatal
I'm happy for you, I'm smiling for you
I'd do anything for you, for you
It's always for you and never for me
And I need it to stop, so let me tell you, please
I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
But I can't tell you that I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able to open up, but
My feelings are fatal
My feelings are fatal
How many times must I keep it inside?
I need to let go and I swear that I've tried
But opening up means trusting others
And that's just too much, I don't want to bother
So I'll keep it inside and I'll bury it deep
I know it's not healthy, but you won't hear a peep
Though I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
I could never tell you that I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors, locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden, there is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able to open up, but
My feelings are fatal, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
My feelings are fatal, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
My feelings are fatal, oh-oh, oh-oh
