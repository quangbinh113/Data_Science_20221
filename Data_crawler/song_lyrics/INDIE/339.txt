Song Name: CONTACTS
I want your number in my telephone so that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone so that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone so that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone so that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my (Oh, oh)
I want you in my, in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my, in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms again
