Song Name: Painkiller
You've been such a jerk
Since you left last week
You're careful with your words
But I'm pulling teeth
You said this wouldn't hurt
Give me cavities
And all of your apologies are only empty calories
After all this time
I start asking why I'm staying
Were you ever mine?
Are we something that's worth saving?
Every conversation puts me back on medication sometimes
Sorry's just another word you're saying
Do I look like her
Does she talk like me?
Been feeling insecure
Co-dependency is hard to break
When you never make it easy
Reconstructive surgery can't fix my anxiety
After all this time
I start asking why I'm staying
Were you ever mine?
Are we something that's worth saving
Every conversation puts me back on medication sometimes
Sorry's just another word you're saying
You're saying
Take me to the hospital
I need Paracetamol
Tramadol, Ketamine
I just need some pain relief
Take me to the hospital
Fill me up with Tylenol
Tramadol, Ketamine
I just need some pain relief
