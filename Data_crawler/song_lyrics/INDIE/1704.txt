Song Name: you make me miserable
I wanna live forever
You wanna die together
I'm a little bit pretentious
When I ask, you always say yes
But now it's getting too hard to breathe
With your hands all over me
You always set me free
Don't stop, I'm
Restless, I've been feeling restless
All the things you said
Going 'round and 'round my head
You make me miserable
Senseless, we've been acting senseless
Naked on the floor
All is fair in love and war
Let's make this biblical
Out of control
I want it all
I think it's time we started
No longer broken-hearted
I got this stupid feelin'
You got me all excited
'Cause now it's getting too hard to breathe
With your hands all over me
You always set me free
Don't stop, I'm
Restless, I've been feeling restless
All the things you said
Going 'round and 'round my head
You make me miserable
Senseless, we've been acting senseless
Naked on the floor
All is fair in love and war
Let's make this biblical
Out of control
I want it all
When we kiss, we taste like whiskey
Maybe that's why you just miss me
When we kiss we taste like whiskey
Maybe that's why you just get me
Restless, I've been feeling restless
All the things you said
Going 'round and 'round my head
You make me miserable
Senseless, we've been acting senseless
Naked on the floor
All is fair in love and war
Let's make this biblical
Out of control
I want it all
Out of control
I want it all
