Song Name: So Humble the Afternoon
So humble the afternoon
Doesn't have to mean you don't lose
I turn the engine on
Doesn't have to mean no notion
I run after you
Doesn't have it to mean it's harder
You know if I fall
Doesn't have to be the last time
You know if I fall
Doesn't have to be the last time
Asleep in the living room
Someone in the folding chair
I feel the cool of sin
Never was clear, so flustered
Quick storms blow right through
Doesn't have to be the window
You know if I fall
Doesn't have to be the last time
