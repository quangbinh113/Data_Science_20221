Song Name: The Only One
There's a man across the street
And he looks just like me
Am I the only one that sees him?
Am I the only one that sees him?
There's a man across the street
And he's looking right at me
Am I the only one that sees him?
Am I the only one in here?
Am I the only one to see myself
With you? You
Am I the only one to place a bet
On you? Only you
(You stay, it's okay)
There's a sparkle in your eye
Just admit it, don't be shy
Am I the only one that sees it?
Am I the only one to see? Come on
Oh, I wanna cross the street
Won't you kiss the other me, love?
'Cause, I'm the only one, believe it
I'm the only one you feel
Am I the only one to see myself
With you? You
Am I the only one to place a bet
On you? The only one, the only one, the only one
(You stay, it's okay)
Here is the house, these are the keys
My love is near, whenever you please
It's logical (you stay), so logical (it's okay)
Take a new heart, break it in two
One part's for me, the other's for you
It's logical (you stay), so logical (it's okay)
Fire, fire, fire, firefly
Fire, fire, fire, firefly
