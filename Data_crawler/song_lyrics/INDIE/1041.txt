Song Name: Greek Tragedy - Oliver Nelson TikTok Remix
We're smashing mics in karaoke bars
You're running late with half your makeup on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill
I love this feelin' but I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much
I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flippin', I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong but my head is loose
She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but darling you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps
I hate this feelin' but I love this part
She really wants to make it work and I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide as soon as I get home
Oh, and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
Oh, and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong but surely worse to leave
She hits like ecstasy
Oh, and she hits like ecstasy
So free up the cheaper seats
Here comes a Greek tragedy
