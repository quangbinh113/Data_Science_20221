Song Name: Met a Girl
I met a girl who was crazy and proud
Sometimes she glistened up in the clouds
She came to me and asked, "Who are you?"
I told her that I need her there, too
I met a girl who was vivid and kind
Not like the ones that I usually find
We watched a poem she lays her head down
On to my shoulder, she laid her crown
I met a girl who was crazy and proud
Knew every bit of history 'round
I listened to her 'til the sun went down
End of the day, I wonder what I found
