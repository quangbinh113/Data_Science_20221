Song Name: Talking to Myself
I keep talking to myself
And I think I'm going crazy
'Cause I've been talking to my-se-se-se-self
(Oh-oh-oh)
Be pretty but not too pretty
Don't try too hard or they'll know
For once try to be normal
Don't be such a shitshow
Oh damn, not again
Be the smartest one in the room
Or they won't take you seriously
Be confident but also slightly self-deprecating
Or they'll think you're a bitch (or they'll think you're bitch)
I try to tame those voices in my head
But I, but I, but
I keep talking to myself (keep talking to myself)
And I think I'm going crazy
'Cause I been talking to my-se-se-se-self (woah)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Haven't been feeling so well (so well)
Been in my head too much lately (lately)
'Cause I keep talking to my-se-se-se-self (ta-ta-ta-ta)
I keep talking to myself
I made a monster
She's getting stronger
Got me doing things I shouldn't
I can't stop her
I spend all my money on pills and therapy
I still can't get no relief (I, I, I)
I keep talking to myself (keep talking to myself)
And I think I'm going crazy (crazy)
'Cause I keep talking to my-se-se-se-self (my se-se-se-self)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Haven't been feeling so well (feeling so well)
Been in my head too much lately (lately)
'Cause I keep talking to my-se-se-se-self (my-se-se-se-self)
I keep talking to myself
Try to tame those voices (try to tame those voices)
In my head
Voices in my head, voices in my head
I keep talking to myself (keep talking to myself)
And I think I'm going crazy (crazy)
'Cause I keep talking to my-se-se-se-self (my-se-se-se-self)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Haven't been feeling so well (feeling so well)
Been in my head too much lately (lately)
'Cause I keep talking to my-se-se-se-self (my-se-se-se-self)
I keep talking to myself
