Song Name: Losing You
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no fuse
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
I know you're waiting for the worst that you can get from me
Just treat me good and baby I'll give you the rest of me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no fuse
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
There's nothing more, I know you're taking it away from me
I gave you everything and now there's nothing left of me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no fuse
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
Tell me the truth boy (baby you know I tried)
Am I losing you for good (can't lose you from my life)
We used to kiss all (baby you know I tried)
Night but now there's just no fuse
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth boy am I losing you for good
