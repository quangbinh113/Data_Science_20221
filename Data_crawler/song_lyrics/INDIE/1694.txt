Song Name: The Gold - Phoebe Bridgers Version
Couldn't really love you anymore
You've become my ceiling
I don't think I love you anymore
That gold mine changed you
You don't have to hold me anymore
Our cave's collapsing
I don't wanna be me anymore
My old man told me
You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
40 miles out of East Illinois
From my old man's heart attack
I believed you were crazy
You believed that you loved me
I don't wanna bark here anymore
The black hills, the colly
It wasn't really dangerous for us
We just catch you coughing
What the hell are we gonna do?
Black mile to the surface
I don't wanna be here anymore
It all tastes like poison
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe
I believed you were crazy
You believe that you love me
You and me, we're a day drink
So, lose your faith in me
Lose your faith in me
Lose your faith in me
Ooh, ohh
