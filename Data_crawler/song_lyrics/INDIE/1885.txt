Song Name: Before the Fall
Once upon a time a violet opened up for spring
Only to encounter violence like she'd never seen
Now her joyful hum echoes through trees
That used to grow where they've paved in the street
Once upon a time a songbird flew away for good
Every melody went unheard in a concrete world
Now her joyful hum echoes through trees
That used to grow where they've paved in the street
After an autumn of ends led to silence
Winters cloak covered the tracks of the tyrants
Spring couldn't bring on the promise of June
With no voice to sing and nothing to bloom
