Song Name: Californian Beach
I'm just wondering how it could be
On a Californian beach
Holding coffee, ice tea while siping on a previous drink
Between all of these faces
People are chilling here
Just wondering now how it could be
Oh I wish I could be on a californian beach with You
We would walk by the sea
Looking for a beauty of a sunset view
Without all of these places
Where people are messing round
I'm wondering how, I think I need it now
There could've been much simpler times
But we can't regret, at least we've tried
So the tables have turned
And everything has changed
We're now where we've meant to be
Still dreaming of the Californian beach
Only what we need
This is only what we need
I'm just wondering how it could be
On a Californian beach
Though I know there's a way
For us to achieve just what we need
We've got a whole lotta places
Where we can spend our time
But wondering about it, I think I need it now
There could've been much simpler times
But we can't regret, at least we've tried
So the tables have turned
And everything has changed
We're now where we've meant to be
Still dreaming of the Californian beach
Only what we need
This is only what we need
(Californian)
Californian beach
(Californian)
This is only what we need
(Californian)
Californian beach
Oh the Californian Beach
This is only what we need
There could've been much simpler times
But we can't regret, at least we've tried
So the tables have turned
And everything has changed
We're now where we've meant to be
Still dreaming of the Californian beach
Only what we need
This is only what we need
(Californian)
(Californian)
(Californian)
Oh the Californian beach
This is only what we need
