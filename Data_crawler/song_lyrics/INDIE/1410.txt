Song Name: Blindsided
Magnolia tree
You said you could see you in me
I was surprised
Could've used you in my life but
You were blind
(Could've used you in my life but)
You were blind
Blindsided
Never really met my friends
Knew each other from a distance
Ask about him, I miss him
Think about it all, miss it
Rode our bikes to the Tom Thumb
Hot summers where I come from
Cold Bud in a solo cup
Fresh air on the radio
In the shade of the back porch
Mama said she's mad at you
After dark on the hi-fi
Is it gonna be alright?
Crank it up to 'Everlong'
Always was your favorite song
Air drums in the living room
Early memoriеs of you
Magnolia tree
You said you could see you in me
I was surprised
Could've usеd you in my life but
You were blind
(Could've used you in my life but)
You were blind
Blindsided
