Song Name: The Fall
These words are supposed to be simple
But it seems that's not the case
This page is staring back at me
I'm afraid to put a mark on its face
Oh, I'm just tryna' introduce you
To this idea that I've grown used to
It's like sharing a dream with someone
Once you say it out loud, it can't be undone
I'd jump off and into your arms
But I can't trust the fall
Take my voice, I'm giving it though
I don't feel safe at all
(I can't trust the fall)
It's like waking up in surgery
I can't seem to see right past the lights and I'm
So scared to take a knife to my chest
Let you see the heart that's inside
Oh, I'm just tryna' introduce you
To this idea that I've grown used to
It's like sharing a dream with someone
Once you say it out loud, it can't be undone
Yeah, once you say it out loud it can't be undone
(I can't trust the fall)
I'd jump off and into your arms
But I can't trust the fall
Take my voice, I'm giving it though
I don't feel safe at all
I'd jump off and into your arms
But I can't trust the fall
Take my voice, I'm giving it though
I don't feel safe at all
(I can't trust the fall)
(I can't trust the fall)
(It's like sharing a dream with someone)
(Once you say it out loud it can't be undone)
(I can't trust the fall)
(I can't trust the fall)
I'd jump off and into your arms
But I can't trust the fall (I can't trust the fall)
Take my voice, I'm giving it though
I don't feel safe at all (don't feel safe at all)
I'd jump off and into your arms
But I can't trust the fall
Take my voice, I'm giving it though
I don't feel safe at all
(It's like sharing a dream with someone)
(Once you say it out loud, it can't be undone)
(I can't trust the fall)
