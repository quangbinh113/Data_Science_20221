Song Name: Thrust
I'm just a teenage sass pants
I'm just a teenage sass pants
I'm just a teenage sass pants
Oh, it's candid you caught me, I always make it happen
Gave him a Hollywood smile and he liked my accent
You fiending little boy? I know you need some
Plus-sized pudgy boys, Tweedle-dee-dum
Get to snacking and battle axing
Outta breath and you heart-attackin'
Circle-whacking, who gets to take Rome?
None of y'all motherfuckers, pack up and go home
Panting like puppies, you love the taste
I'll be around for a while, cool the haste
Hot stuff, wants me to call him boss
Well, I'm a habanero pepper, you can lick my sauce
Ooh, you can lick my sauce
So, all my cool kittens, put your claws in the sky
Stub out your joints like it's 4:25
And gimme something I can thrust to
Gimme something I can thrust to
Boys, put your drawers in the sky
Fly 'em like a flag on the 4th of July
Gimme something I can thrust to
Do I done does this thing? Yeah, I must do
Ooh, I'm a saucy salad and I'd like you to toss me
Us three can doodle bop in some soft sheets
Fucking obscure, you can blink and miss it
Think I'll pay him a visit, my life coach is in prison
And I have a staring problem, my gazes linger
Bug-eyed glasses, thick as chubby baby fingers
Lips locking like I'm glued to your mouth
Gave your girlfriend head on my studio couch
Wow, it's a scandal how can a world handle
A foul-mouth girl with a plan to dismantle
Your ideas of what ladies should do
I don't owe you shit, I bid you adieu
You a salty little pretzel, I ain't aiming to please
Post-lunch snacking, dip you in nacho cheese, ay
So, all my cool kittens, put your claws in the sky
Stub out your joints like it's 4:25
And gimme something I can thrust to
Gimme something I can thrust to
Boys, put your drawers in the sky
Fly 'em like a flag on the 4th of July
Gimme something I can thrust to
G-g-gimme something I can thrust to
Do I done does this thing? Yeah, I must do
Do I done does this thing? Yeah, I must do
Do I done does this thing? Yeah, I must do
Machete for a tongue, it's a jungle I cut through
