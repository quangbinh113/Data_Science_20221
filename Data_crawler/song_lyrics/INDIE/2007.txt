Song Name: im so happy
I'm so happy
You're too good for me
You're too good for me
My heart's made of gold
At least that's what I've been told
But the flowers in my soul
Are getting old
I'm so happy
You're too good for me
You're too good for me
My eyes might be cold
But my hands are nice to hold
So just promise
To not let go
Say you won't
I'm so happy
You're too good for me
You're too good for me
