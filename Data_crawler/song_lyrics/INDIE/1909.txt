Song Name: wish i could see you again
You're gone in the morning
And now im living in silence
But i still have your number in my phone
I wish that i could see you again
You are the reason why
I still don't understand
And sometimes it gets hard to pretend
Still wish that i could see you again
You are the reason why
I still don't understand
And sometimes it gets hard to pretend
Still wish that i could see you again
Still wish that i could see you again
Still wish that i could see you again
Yeah i still remember
How you looked me in my eyes
How you said you love me
And how we danced for the whole night
Do you ever think of me
Because baby i still think of you
And everytime you're not with me
I can't breath
Just wanna hold you close to me
You are the reason why
I still don't understand
And sometimes it gets hard to pretend
Still wish that i could see you again
You are the reason why
I still don't understand
And sometimes it gets hard to pretend
Still wish that i could see you again
I still wish that i could see you
I still wish that i could see you
I still wish that i could see you
I still wish that i could see you again
