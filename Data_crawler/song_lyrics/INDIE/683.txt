Song Name: Look Who's Cryin' Now
White lies
You love to spin 'em
Eat that shit for dinner every night
Just like you love those white lines
Baby, you're bitter
Paint me like the sinner every time
If you can't take the heat
Get the fuck out the kitchen
I won't be the one that's stuck reminiscing
Say it's on me but I ain't finna listen
You turned into a ghost
Out with your friends so I'm at a party
2:00 a.m. sins, mix 'em up with BACARDÍ
Never said you're sorry
Fucked her in the 'Rari, oh
Look who's crying now
Tables turned around
You didn't give a fuck
When it was my heart on the ground
But now you're on your knees
While I'm wrapped in his sheets
Yeah, karma's a bitch but she ain't got nothing on me
Look who's crying now
No fun
Oh, how ironic
You can't stand when I'm holding the gun
But baby, you drew first blood
The way you cursed us and then you had the nerve to call it love
If you can't take the heat
Get the fuck out the kitchen
I won't be the one that's stuck reminiscing
Say it's on me but I ain't finna listen
You turned into a ghost
Out with your friends so I'm at a party
2:00 a.m. sins, mix 'em up with BACARDÍ
Never said you're sorry
Fucked her in the 'Rari, oh
Look who's crying now
Tables turned around
You didn't give a fuck
When it was my heart on the ground
But now you're on your knees
While I'm wrapped in his sheets
Yeah, karma's a bitch but she ain't got nothing on me
Look who's cryin' now
Look who's cryin' now
Yeah, I said look who's cryin' now
Look who's cryin' now
Look who's cryin' now
