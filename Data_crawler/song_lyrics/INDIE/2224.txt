Song Name: Gloomy Girl
Hang my head until my neck breaks
There's a dark cloud over me that I can't shake
Sounds so easy when you say it
"Hey, don't be so gloomy, girl"
I'm rain on your parade
And I hate that I'm such a gloomy girl
Wasting the days stuck like glue
Just the way it goes
Wasting away in my room
I know
I should go out and see the sun
Yeah, I know
I should go out and be more fun
But I don't
Stay in bed until my back aches
'Cause it's only in these sheets that I feel safe
So uneasy when you say it
"Hey, don't be so gloomy, girl"
I'm feeling kinda lame
And I hate that I'm such a gloomy girl
Wasting the days stuck like glue
Just the way it goes
Wasting away in my room
I know
I should go out and see the sun
Yeah, I know
I should go out and bе more fun
But I don't
Wasting the days stuck like gluе
Just the way it goes
Wasting away in my room
I know
I should go out and see the sun
Yeah, I know
I should go out and be more fun
But I don't
Now I don't
I don't
I don't
I don't
