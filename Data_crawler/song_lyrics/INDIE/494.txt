Song Name: The Key to Life on Earth
Gold, let it unfold
Imagine you're dressed in gold
Roaring crowds in Manchester
Will manage to be told
Oh and your king
The boy you loved in spring
The way she looks at him
The common goal
And waiting for the kids to go
We've been, held back for after school meetings
They've got it in for me
For all it's worth
The key to life on earth
Jokers, happy go xenophobe locals
Have got it in for me
For all I'm worth
The key to life on earth
Holy smokes
You kids and your jokes
Asking where we got our jeans
Where the hell we found our coats
'Cause dirty streets these days are graced
By Nikes of black and green
And headstrong boys in chinos
Barely grasp what that could mean
And they lie
Then men that wrung us dry
The boys who poked your eye
The common fool, the walk to school for you and I
We've been, held back for after school meetings
They've got it in for me
For all it's worth
The key to life on earth
The thing is, he's out of touch
Scrounging rich kids
Are living here for free
On my home turf
The key to life on earth
Call in to wake you up in the morning
Iron your suit and tie
Forever till you die
Join forces like carousels
And their horses forever spinning round
And never coming down
Come out and join us honey, we will sort you out
Come work in Brookfield Farm and we will shut your mouth
Come work in Sainsburys babe, until you've had enough
Come on out, come on out
Come on out, come on out
Come out and join us honey we will sort you out
Come work in Brookfield Farm and we will shut your mouth
Come work in Sainsburys babe until you've had enough
Come on out, come on out
Come on out, come on out
