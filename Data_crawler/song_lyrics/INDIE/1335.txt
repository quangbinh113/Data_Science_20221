Song Name: through it all
I am here through it all, all
I'm just a guy who falls
And I can't keep the feeling stuck in the back of my mind
And I tried too many, tried too many times
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll give you signs until I make you mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll give you signs until I make you mine
I am here through it all, all
I'm just a guy who falls
And I can't keep the feeling stuck in the back of my mind
And I tried too many, tried too many times
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll give you signs until I make you mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll give you signs until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Until I make you mine, until I make you mine
Until I make you mine, until I make you mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
