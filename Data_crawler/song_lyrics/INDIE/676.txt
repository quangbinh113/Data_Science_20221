Song Name: Lotta True Crime
So this girl's out back, behind the bar
She's a good girl
She called a car
You got three motherfuckers in a big white van
Two dumb friends and one mean man
Well she'll fucking kill you
She wins every fight
She's gonna rock your shit by the end of the night
And the only advantage that a killer has
Is they think they have the right
I listen to a lot of True Crime
I listen to it at night
I like the girl talk
It makes me feel alright
I like scary stories in the morning
And I like 'em at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel just fine
I listen to a lot of True Crime
You know Dennis Rader and David Parker Ray
Actually sit together in Hell
Shaking quaking terrified
That one day, somehow, someway
They might meet me
They took our girls away from home
They're in the woods, they're all alone
The ropes are heavy and the knots are tight
Tied by a monster and his oblivious wife
Well, I hope this doesn't seem too impolite
But Ted Bundy was just never that fucking bright
He was just sorta charismatic and white, alright?
And he was so fucking sure he had the right
But he's ugly and I'm glad he's dead
'Cause there was no fucking candle in his pumpkin head
You're not special for winning a game
With someone who you know was never playing
She could've killed you
She had every right
You just caught her off guard tonight
But it's alright
She'll be fine
We listen to a lotta True Crime
One of our young turned up last night
They found their body but not their eyes
Somebody new must've gone bad
Where's the lord to take care of that?
Where's the lord to take care of that?
I listen to a lot of True Crime
I listen to it at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel alright
I like scary stories in the morning
And I like 'em at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel just fine
I listen to a lot of True Crime
