Song Name: WILSHIRE
Fuck, yeah
Met you on a Saturday
Knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fucking across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was coming to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested
That would be dumb, if I denied
Long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck
'Cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til morning, vibration was heavy
I wasn't drowning or yawning
That's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same
But you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he's my friend
But if I'm honest, I'm really hoping you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make
All them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes", I'm like, "Hmm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool hand shake
But whatever, we still could be friends
It still could be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got something we cannot pretend
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off
They like, "No, no, it's not a end"
It was too late and shit
FaceTiming it ain't 'bout nothing
You laughing, packing your luggage
It's nothing incriminating but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the-
Nah, we never did that
Although I haven't seen him in months
Shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me
So we can kick it
Right in front of his lenses, since nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie
We went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk
Man, that nigga not fucking stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin'
We fronting like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth
I'm just a nigga on the surface, for real
Surface
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
You know, they be fuckin'
Yuh, yuh
Didn't see you a couple weeks
Think he want you away from me
Know y'all argue 'bout if you mad
You met him before you met me
I feel guilty but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control but not as much as I could
I been down for days
You're in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat, knowing you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that"
He left for some days
I cleared out my sched, I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mines
I say that we fled, no you pick a place
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days wit me
Your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtying my bakin' pots, tennis at my momma spot
Chauffered in the Rolls
The back entrance at them restaurants
Parks playing chess games, giving wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providing methane
Shopping 'til we dropping, what you copping?
See, the price is not an option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer
But you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link
It's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we're friends
But we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missing in life
I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches
Every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter
If I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling
'Cause we're twinnin' and we're matchin'
You stayed in the car
When I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of that car with you
And talk about who we are
You told me when you're with me it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended
And told me that you didn't wanna hurt him
Why we doing this?
Told me this a awkward situation
And you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him it started problems
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What kinda sweater I'm wearing
What music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever
That's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line
But he got every right to be a little pissed off
He you picked up, y'all got in argument
He got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost"
Your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he seen me make you smile
That nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, tho
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You asked if I gotta, I asked if you gotta
We tripping on our words
Nobody is lying, Hakuna Matata
We sat in the car and cried for an hour
My shirt look like a shower head got it
We called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was paying for, I took 3 L's
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground
I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city
With no destination back up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagra
Vill right beside me making sure I didn't crash
Or do something heinous
'Cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had
Never again will find it
You're in the wrong, gotta remind you
'Bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it
Talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit
When you're in relationship
And you're 100 with your mate
So don't go actin' like no saint
This a two way street
And shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone
You was lounging in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my momma and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, tho it's not fun
You still got yo nigga and still had yo fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said
We couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like bad perm
We'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach
While our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothing, I kept it real
I told you I loved you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you
Promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
On God, I love that girl
I'm a sh-, I'm a bad person
Like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have
Just vanish when a certain energy is nearin'
And those feelings got so much gravity
And it's out of your control
It made me realize adults
Don't know what they doing either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt 200 percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life
'Cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in a book
