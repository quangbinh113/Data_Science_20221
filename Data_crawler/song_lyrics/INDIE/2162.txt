Song Name: Stockholmsvy
I'll be honest
I'll be honest for you, yeah yeah, yeah
And if we're talking, I'm gon' tell you the truth
Yeah
You and me made a lover of an enemy, yeah
No, no, no, no
Stockholmsvy, we're gonna make a memory
'Cause you've been on the west side showing them your best side
You've been wearing new jeans and shoes
While I've been living less life
Sleepless get no rest nights thinking 'bout us and how I do
You and me made a lover of an enemy, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
Stockholmsvy, we're gonna make a memory (memory)
Okay, do you remember when she lied to you? (I do)
Remember how she almost fooled me too? (I do)
You could do better I mean honestly (I could)
This is your city it's your Stockholmsvy
Light rain, izzy veins, diamonds on my face
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
You say you wanna go I wanna stay
Baby it's okay, yeah I'm okay by myself
You and me made a lover of an enemy (yeah) yeah
No, no, no, no
Stockholmsvy, we're gonna make a memory
