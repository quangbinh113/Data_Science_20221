Song Name: be
Well, I'm not sold on soulmates
But do believe in twist of fate
I don't believe in shootin' stars
But made a wish and here we are
But what if we're not meant to be?
What if dreams aren't meant for dreams?
Don't believe in being sad
So, would you try to understand, when I ask?
If we fall apart
Who should I call to help me mend my heart?
If feelings fade and go their separate ways
Who'd be my light in dark
Well, I don't know
But what I do know is, I hope they never do
I don't know who I'd be without you
I've always liked the way you think
Try to see your side of things and you asked
What could we be a better yet?
What if we had never met at all?
And if we fall apart
Who would I call to help me mend my heart?
If feelings fade, we go our separate ways
Who'd be my light in dark
Well, I don't know
But what I do know is, I hope we never do
I don't know who I'd be without
You and all your little things
You've taught me love, you make me sing
I wonder if you'll ever know the truth
That you and all the things you do
Put every piece of me into
And if we part forever, I'll be blue
But if we decide to separate
Before I go, I've gotta say that
If we fall apart
I'll be right here to help you mend your heart
If feelings fade, we go our separate ways
I'll be your light through dark
And even though I'll know you're not alone
One thing will still be true
I don't know who I'd be without
How would I even breathe without
I don't know who I'd be without you
