Song Name: I Love This Song
Don't know about time
Feeling the sunshine
Know everything is right
And I love The sight
Don't know about time
Feeling the sunshine
Know everything is right
And I love The sight
Boat of emotion feel the sea streaming on
Dance around in my room because I love this song
I do
Think about the planet spinning
Spirals
Round the ball of fire we sitting
Natural
If you feel it, it's not missing
Casual
That's life
And its a given
Don't know about time
Feeling the sunshine
Know everything is right
And I love The sight
Don't know about time
Feeling the sunshine
Know everything is right
And I love The sight
Boat of emotion feel the sea streaming on
Dance around in my room because I love this song
Tried to two step with you, but we moved on
Wasted time is no good, so long
Last time inside
Until we live
Sun Bathing on the moon
Solar eclipse
What a view
Feel the breeze
Boat of emotion feel the sea streaming on
Dance around in my room because I love this song
Tried to two step with you, but we moved on
Wasted time is no good, so long
Don't know bout time
Feeling the sunshine
Know everything's right
