Song Name: ANGELS & DEMONS
Two face, two face, yeah
Black, white, left, right, yeah
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Don't forget my name
I don't feel the same
On a trip, no train
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now
Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
I don't really think I'm the problem
I don't really think it's a problem
Me plus me is a problem
One gunshot could solve 'em
Tell my friends I'm sorry though
T-t-t-tell my sins to go
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now
(Rockstar, rockstar)
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm falling from Eden
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now
(Just a rockstar)
(I'm tryna do it, rockstar)
(Like a rockstar)
