Song Name: Washing Machine Heart
Toss your dirty shoes
In my washing machine heart ️
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already?
And toss your dirty shoes
In my washing machine heart ️
Baby, bang it up inside
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am (hang on)
I know who you pretend I am
But do, mi, ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do, mi, ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do, mi, ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
