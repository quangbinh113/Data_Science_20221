Song Name: Fugazi
When you turn me around
Know it'll be alright
Looking inside
You've got nothing to hide
Face is a mess
I'm wondering how
What happens when we're young
Doesn't seem to work out
An idea, will leave me breathless
An idea, you leave me breathless
There is something I said
That I regret
But he thought that he showed me Fugazi
I don't know how to explain how that feels
It doesn't make sense why it hurt me
An idea, will leave me breathless
An idea, you leave me breathless
