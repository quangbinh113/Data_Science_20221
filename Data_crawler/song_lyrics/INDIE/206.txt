Song Name: HEARTEATER
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Ooh, you're poison
Poison, filled with poison
Fill my veins with poison
Poison, filled with poison
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
