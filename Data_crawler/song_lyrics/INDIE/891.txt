Song Name: Follow the Rules...
We laid our cards face up on the table
You were my queen, I was your ace, yeah
We bet all of our love
Guess that wasn't enough
Now we got nothing left in the bank
But don't blame me, I don't blame you
Don't blame the game if we win or we lose
Don't know why, don't seem true
Did everything right but didn't make it through
We follow our hearts,
But love don't follow the rules
Ran hand and hand, nothing could stop us
We thought we crossed the finish line
Some days I don't believe, the universe is a fair referee
Wish I had a way to change it's mind
But don't blame me, I don't blame you
Don't blame the game if we win or we lose
Don't know why, don't seem true
Did everything right but didn't make it through
We follow our hearts,
But love don't follow the rules
Don't blame me, I don't blame you
Don't blame the game if we win or we lose
Don't know why, don't seem true
Did everything right but didn't make it through
We follow our hearts,
But love don't follow the rules
Love don't, love don't follow the rules
So don't follow the rules
