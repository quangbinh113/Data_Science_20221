Song Name: You're All I Want
You would use your songs to say the words you couldn't say
And every word you sang was about you and me
I loved everything you wrote
And when you would sing I felt that my heart was falling
You're all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all I want, all I love
And with Cristal and pink champagne,
On our wedding day you had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us
Then you got on top of it and you sang to me as the snow was falling
You're all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all I want, all I love
