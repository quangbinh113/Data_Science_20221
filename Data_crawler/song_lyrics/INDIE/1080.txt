Song Name: pretending
Let's head downtown, let's fuck around
Let's get fucked up and let me take you out
Let's fall in love and never fallin' out
You can keep the keys, if I can keep the house
I don't wanna stay stuck on pretending
Can't get you out my head when you're in my mentions
Oh, oh, you bring out the best in me
Whenever you're next to me
Feel like I'm buried deep
(Hey) you take me in and bring me out
Caught doing shit we not allowed
Although your mind is filled with doubt
I know you'll somehow come around
Hey, but I know you won't
You ain't say one word on the whole ride home
Told me you spent the night alone
I know your ex man got you gone
So, tell me what you need from me
Been beggin' on my knees
I hate it when you leave
Know you make me complete (ooh-whoa)
She likes my whinin', wastin' my time
And I really lied to her, you said I'm timeless
I feel like I'm dyin', I can't move my eyelids, I
I don't wanna stay stuck on pretending
Can't get you out my head when you're in my mentions
Oh, oh, you bring out the best in me
Whenever you're next to me
Feel like I'm buried deep
