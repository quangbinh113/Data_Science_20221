Song Name: Lovesong
I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learned to accept
When I've been a mess, it's not your fault
But I keep forgetting it's what we do
I missed the train again, I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days, but to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song about you
Just another love song about you
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
I'm running over sentences at times
I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorised
But I keep forgetting just what to do
I missed the train again, I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days, but to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song about you
Just another love song about you
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
