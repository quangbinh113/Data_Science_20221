Song Name: i haunt ur dreams
One, two, three, four
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
You don't see me walk through the walls
And you're ignoring all my calls
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I saw you looking through the door
Of your 2006 accord
I floated up, to the 3rd floor
Well, watch the news if you get bored
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You heard a noise and then you laughed
A couple of days after I passed
You brushed it off, slept alone
You'll never know, that I'm a ghost
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
You don't see me walk through the walls
And you're ignoring all my calls
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I found your privacy for rent
I'll follow you until your end
When you were young, you liked the snow
But now you're all dried up and cold
When you're in bed, you lie awake
I haunt your dreams, you think I'm fake
I walk around, when you're asleep
You'll never know the walls I creep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
You don't see me walk through the walls
And you're ignoring all my calls
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
You don't see me walk through the walls
And you're ignoring all my calls
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
I can't find my feet anymore
My hands are drifting through the floor
I'm haunting you
I'm haunting you
