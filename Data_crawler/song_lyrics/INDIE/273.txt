Song Name: So Close
Thinking about you
As I'm lying next to someone else
Drinking without you, oh
Doesn't fix me but it kinda helps
Oh, I still wish we could go back to where we started
When you left your t-shirt at my old apartment
Have you ever wondered if you loved me harder
Where we'd be, where we'd be now?
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?
When we got so close, so close to love
I never noticed, oh
I was busy tryna work this out
Why was I holding on
When I knew you'd only let me down?
But I still wish we could go back to where we started
When you left your t-shirt at my old apartment
Have you ever wondered if you loved me harder
Where we'd be, where we'd be now?
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?
When we got so close, so close to love
To love
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
Yeah, we got so close
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much?
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?
When we got so close, so close to love
To love
Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
