Song Name: Can You See Me
Can you see me now
Am I just the ghost of who you had around
When you hear the sound
Of words that leave my mouth
Do they still bring you down?
I see the look on your face
It says so much you don't have to
The feeling I face is mine to hold
You don't have to
But I still really really care
Yes I do
Don't look away
Don't let it fade
Cause when the sun goes down
It comes back around
So don't look away
You don't need me now
Everything we've ever said comes back around
Can you feel it now?
Head in the clouds and feet up on the ground
I see the look on your face
It says so much you don't have to
The feeling I face is mine to hold
You don't have to
But i still really really care
Yes I do
But I still really really care
Yes I do
Don't look away
Don't let it fade
Cause when the sun goes down
It goes back around
So, don't look away
