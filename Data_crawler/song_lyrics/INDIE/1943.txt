Song Name: i wanna be your girlfriend
Oh, Hannah, I wanna feel you close
Oh, Hannah, come lie with my bones
Oh, Hannah, don't look away

Oh, Hannah, just look at me the same
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
Oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah
Oh, Hannah, tell me something nice
Like flowers and blue skies
Oh, Hannah, I will follow you home
Although my lips are blue and I'm cold
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
Oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna be your bitch
And I wanna touch you, but not like this
The look in your eyes
My hands between your thighs
Oh, this can't be real
It's all just a dream
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath
