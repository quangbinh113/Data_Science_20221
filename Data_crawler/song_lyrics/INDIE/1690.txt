Song Name: Joe
How much of myself can I give away
'Til there's nothing left to take from me
Feels like I'm losing things I can't replace
It's an emptiness that makes me weak
Cause I built you up
You just break me down
When I'm alone
I can hear the sound
I just can't stand it when you said my name
I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
Cause you're nothing without me
Cause this is not a ship that could pass in the night
It's a wreck and I'm drowning, been here all my life
I was 18 and screaming and feeling it all
Now I'm up on the edge of a bridge and I know
If I let you down
Would you let me in
Cause when I'm alone
I could hear you now
I just can't stand it when you said my name
I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
Cause you're nothing without me
Yeah you were always saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can still hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Cause you're nothing without me
Cause you're nothing without me
You're nothing without
I don't know what it takes to be happy
I think I'm petrified of dying
But living's just too hard to walk it, if I've tried
Look in the mirror, see me crying
But every time I do, I hear you say my name
I can hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
Yeah you were always saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me
I can hear you say it (I still hear you saying)
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
Yeah you were always saying (I still hear you saying)
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me
Yeah, you're nothing without
