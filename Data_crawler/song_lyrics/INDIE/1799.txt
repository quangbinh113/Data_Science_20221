Song Name: Drown
I'm gon' float when you drown
'Cause I been fine here all alone
I been right here on my own so long
I'm gon' walk when you're down
'Cause girl this house don't feel like home
And these feelings that I hold are so wrong
Can't understand when I'm locked up in your room all night
Am I rude? All you do is heal the bruise I got
I'm not your man, I'm just tryna be your boo tonight
I know I said all I did but I can't take his spot
Do you believe in love?
Cause girl I'm running from it
I know you feel my heart
Ooh la, la, la
Do you believe in love?
Can't take your side
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I don't belie-e-e-e-eve
I can't be
What you want
Baby all I need's
Summer loving
If you can't breathe
Grab my arm
But don't count on me
Summer love
Summer love
Cut it off
We just be sipping on some Bacard'
We just been taking shots in the dark
I just been running laps round your heart
Oh my, she get what she want
My mind ain't what you thought
Darling you make me feel alive
Oh I
Do you believe in love?
Cause girl I'm running from it
I know you feel my heart
Ooh la, la, la
Do you believe in love?
Can't take your side
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I don't belie-e-e-e-eve
I can't be
What you want
Baby all I need's
Summer loving
If you can't breathe
Grab my arm
But don't count on me
Summer love
Summer love
I'm not your friend don't keep me close
I'll give you comfort that's all I know
Under the covers and through the night
Then I'm (gone, gone, gone, gone)
Who the fuck gon' hold you when you're cold, hold you when you're cold
Keep you on your toes, shit you'll never know (yeah)
I know this ain't love, I know this ain't love
Told you I'm gone, told you I'm gone
I can't be
What you want
Baby all I need's summer loving
If you can't breathe, grab my arm
But don't count on me for summer love
I just want summer love
