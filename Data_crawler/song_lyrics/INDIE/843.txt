Song Name: dear parents
I still remember, that one December
You both fought at the dinner, now Christmas just isn't the same
I still remember, road trip one summer
You didn't talk to each to each other
I was scared that you might seperate
But I'm twenty-something now, and there's someone that I've found
I think they might be the one
I'm scared to love like you do the only way I know how to
I'm scared to love like you do cause I don't wanna lose him too
No I don't wanna love like you
I still remember, when I was youngeer
Never saw you that often, just got lots of presents from you
I still remember, when I got older
You said love was just coping, but I'm hoping I never do
But I'm twenty-something now, and there's someone that I've found
I think they might be the one
I'm scared to love like you do the only way I know how to
I'm scared to love like you do cause I don't wanna lose her too
No I don't wanna love like you
No I don't wanna love like you
