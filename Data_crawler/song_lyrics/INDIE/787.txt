Song Name: Mr. Fear
Hello
My name is Mr. Fear
I wish I had a faster therapy
I've come
To mind control your needs
Tonight I'm gonna star all of your leads
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming near
How long
You'll call me insincere?
I'm not here to fulfill your parody
How come my song become unreal?
You never understand my melody
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't fight with me, my dear
Why can't I be in here?
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm so alone
I know it's not real
But it's in my soul
And I just can try to face
The dark inside my head
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't trust in me my dear
What cure is coming near?
