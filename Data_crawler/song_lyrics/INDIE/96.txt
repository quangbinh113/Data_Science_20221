Song Name: Adulting
Life's a tickin' time bomb, sick and tired of trying
Birthday's just remind me i'm closer to dying
Life was easier when on the verge of seventeen
Can't buy alcohol, i'm taking shots of Listerine
I'll figure it out, eventually
I can never decide who I should be
The older I get, seems like the less that I know
Trying to be more than, ever before
It's hard adulting, avoiding self-growth
Adolescence is a mid-quarter life crisis
Cookie-cutter, marriage-license, bachelor's degree
Pressure pulsing got to stick to routine normalcy
Life was easier but now your almost 23
Wasting time on worries, nothing feels like certainty
I'll figure it out, eventually
I can never decide who I should be
The older I get, seems like the less that I know
Trying to be more than, ever before
It's hard adulting, avoiding self-growth
Adolescence is a mid-quarter life crisis
Growing pains won't go away, i'm breaking
Miss my mom, my body's always aching
You could be, anything, anyone,
You're all grow up
