Song Name: confident
Stop saying I'm moving forward
I'm sitting still and I'm feeling fine

I should be a little more confident in myself, and I'm aware
But I will fade and comprehend
There's no way out once you are in
These days, I feel like I do nothing right
These days, I feel like I do nothing right
These days, I feel like I do nothing right
These days, I feel like-
