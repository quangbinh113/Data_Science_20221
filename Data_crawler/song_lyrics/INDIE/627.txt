Song Name: Survive
Yeah
Here we go again, woke up to a brighter day
Everything we need but we wanna hide away
Wanna come to life as we slowly drift away
Wanna take a chance but we just can't find the way
Here we go again, it's always on our mind
Like a parasite that just keeps us paralysed
Wanna come to life, it's enough to make you cry
Barely holding on, we just want to say goodbye
Want to say goodbye, want to say goodbye
I look to the sky, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, just one step at a time
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
Always on my mind, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, this life, this life, this life
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
Here we go again, made it through calamity
If you left us now it would be catastrophe
Even though it hurts, why not try again today?
You can feel brand new
Make it better every day
Here we go again, one more day under the sky
Reaching through the wind, we can make it through the night
Even though it hurts, we can hold it to this life
See heaven here on Earth if you just open your eyes
Just open your eyes, just open your eyes
I look to the sky, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, just one step at a time
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
Always on my mind, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, this life, this life, this life
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
Breathe the air
Come to life
Put your faith in me
Fly every time we touch
Follow me
Beyond here and now
I look to the sky, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, just one step at a time
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
Always on my mind, I will survive (I will survive)
Take me away from this life, this life, this life, this life
One step at a time, I will survive (I will survive)
Wanna feel more than alive
