Song Name: Steam
Shouldn't complain, but this function's dry
Don't wanna small-talk or socialize
What are you doing tonight?
Are you alone by yourself?
What are you doing tonight?
Come on over
Let yourself in
You got the key
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
Let yourself in
You got the key
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me tonight
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me is a vibe
It's been a minute
I miss that face
I miss your smile and the wild things you say
What are we doing tonight?
Take a dip in Forrest Hill
What are we doing tonight?
Come on over
Let yourself in
You got the steam
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
Let yourself in
You got the key
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me tonight
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me is a vibe, yeah
Two step (two step)
Slide (slide)
Let's rock (like this)
All night (come on)
Two step (two step)
Slide (slide)
Let's rock (like this)
All night
Let yourself in
You got the steam
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
Let yourself in
You got the key
You know, you know, you got a hold on me
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me tonight
(Come get me right)
We don't need nobody
Baby, you and me is a vibe
