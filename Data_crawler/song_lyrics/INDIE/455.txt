Song Name: Hold Me By The Heart
Wasn't sure I'd be alright
Wasn't sure I'd be okay again
Didn't know how to take flight
Wings broken couldn't seem to bend
Somehow you came and like the wind
You picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I've been thinking that you should
Pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
Hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart (hold me by the heart)
Help me fly again
Always read all the fairytales
Always knew that it would come
Through the pain I convinced myself
"It's only magical for some"
Somehow you came and like the wind
You picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I've been thinking that you should
Just pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
And hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart (hold me by the heart)
Help me fly again
(Pick up the pieces)
(Help me learn to stand) Help me learn to stand
(Lift me from the ground and)
(Use your hands) Use your hands
(Pick up the pieces) Hey
(Help me learn to stand) Help me learn to stand
(Lift me from the ground and)
(Use your hands) Use your hands
Use your hands
(Hold me by the heart)
(Hold me by the heart) Hold me by the heart
Tell me it would never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So hold me by the heart
Help me fly again
