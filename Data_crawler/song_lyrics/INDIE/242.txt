Song Name: I Met Sarah in the Bathroom
Alright uh, let me tell this story
So I met this girl at a party
Really cute girl, uh she had
You know the clips from Walmart
That you put in your hair?
The colorful ones? Yeah she had that
Uh, gorgeous makeup and pretty clothes
She was like a insta-baddie
She was like one of those girls
Her name was Sarah
I was kinda shy
But she was a daredevil
And she liked to smoke
But she didn't like to drink
'Cause she know that
Her parents will yell at her
Then she said
"Hey Layla!" (Yeah what's up?)
"You know, I really like hanging out with ya!"
(Aww, I really like hanging out with you too!)
"I think I really wanna kiss ya"
(Wait... really?)
"Yeah, but I don't want to scare ya!"
(Aw no, it's cool!)
Next thing I know
Sarah took me to the bathroom

And then I met Sarah in the bathroom
Now we're up against the wall
And she's calling me baby
I said, "Are you sure? This is kinda crazy"
She says, "I just really wanna go!
I don't wanna take it slow"
Sarah in the bathroom
And with a face like hers
I can't say no, I can't say no
