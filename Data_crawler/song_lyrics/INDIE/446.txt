Song Name: Undrunk
Wish I could get a little undrunk
So I could uncall you
At five in the morning, I would unfuck you
Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here should've gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone
I start touching myself to the photos
That you used to send me
I should've deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn
As much as the thought of you
Wish I could get a little undrunk so I could uncall you
At five in the morning, I would unfuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could unkiss the room full of strangers
So I could unspite you, unlose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't want to face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around
So I'm touching myself to the photos
That you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking but spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you
Wish I could get a little undrunk so I could uncall you
At five in the morning, I would unfuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could unkiss the room full of strangers
So I could unspite you, unlose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you
Been through every emotion
Right now I'm sad, I'm broken
Like the bottles on the floor
But I'm to buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little undrunk
So I could, I could unlove you
Wish I could get a little undrunk so I could uncall you
At five in the morning, I would unfuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could unkiss the room full of strangers
So I could unspite you, unlose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you
You, you
Wish I could unlove you
You, you, you
Wish I could uncall you
You, you, you
Wish I could unfuck you
You
Wish I could unlove you
