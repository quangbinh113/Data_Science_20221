Song Name: Loverboy
Yeah, you can call me lover boy
They say I throw my heart around
And you can be my lover girl
I'll pick you up, drive you around
I'll show you how to fall in love
We'll be the talk of all the town
Now everybody wants to be like us
They're getting jealous, feel it now
Oh, wow
Kill the lights
Oh, baby, close your eyes
The way you're looking at me
You've got me mesmerized
Something I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good loving
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothing will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh, yeah
It's such a shame
Somehow the love came to an end
You've started talking to a tool
You're telling lies to all your friends
But you know damn well it should be me
But I'm moving on, doing my best
Now everybody whispers things 'bout us
You're hearing voices in your head
Can't forget
Kill the lights
Oh, baby, close your eyes
The way you're looking at me
You've got me mesmerized
Something I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good loving
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothing will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Kill the lights
Oh, baby, close your eyes
The way you're looking at me
You've got me mesmerized
Something I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good loving
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothing will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Kill the lights
Oh, baby, close your eyes
The way you're looking at me
You've got me mesmerized
Something I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good loving
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothing will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
