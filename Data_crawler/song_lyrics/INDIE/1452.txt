Song Name: concrete
No shade, but you gonna see (no)
How you gonna through dirt on my name jeez?
Nigga, please, I know that you proud of me
Sprouting from the underground through the concrete
Baby, go slow when you ridin' me
Take your time with me (take your time)
Makin' honey drip down like a bumblebee
Fuck me like she proud of me (yeah, okay)
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me, of me
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Holding hands when I need a break
I don't know how much more I can take
Need to meditate, no nеver go away
Tryin' to be my best, what morе can I say?
Yeah, I'm on the road, but I'm not alone
Told you on the phone
If you need it and I got it, no it's not a loan
Want to help before I go
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me, of me
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Remember waiting for ya at the train stop
I put new songs on my iPod
I wanna show 'em to ya, I like what you think
I like when you smile, when you hear me sing
Remember back then?
We was burning through some packs on the corner like some gargoyles laughing
Piggybacking, you was proud
After the show, you took me out
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me, of me
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Uh
No
Clouds broke, now it's raining on me
My ancestors, yeah, they watch over me
Watering me
Watching me grow
