Song Name: blood on the pavement
Watch the world turn white
As You open your eyes
Flashes fade to squares of light
Projected on scraper sides
This isn't a figment
This is your life
Watching the river
Blood on the pavement
The city might be bigger
But your smaller in it
You see a city as a phase
New York at night
LA by day
Explosion of sparks on the street
As cigarette leaves teeth
And meets the concrete
Performed disinterest
In everyone you meet
You must be asleep
Just a bad dream
Watching the river
Blood on the pavement
The city might be bigger
But your smaller in it
You see a city as a phase
New York at night
LA by day
A summer lasts forever
Depending on your age
Is there one you still remember
That you swear left you changed
Perhaps tied to a person
Or maybe a place
