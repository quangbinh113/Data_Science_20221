Song Name: American Teenager
Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make believe
Another high-school football team
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream
And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
And I'm all alone again
Say what you want
But say it like you mean it with your fists for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day then you're done
I do what I want
Crying in the bleachers and I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here
Sunday morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I seemed off, but I was probably wasted (wasted)
And didn't feel so good (feel so good)
Head full of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening, let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there
Why do I feel alone in this room with you?
And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here
Say what you want
But say it like you mean it with your fists for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day then you're done
I do what I want
Crying in the bleachers and I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here
Say what you want
But say it like you mean it with your fists for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day then you're done
I do it for my daddy and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want and damn, I'm doing it well
For me
For me
For me
For me
