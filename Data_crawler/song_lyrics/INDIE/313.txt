Song Name: You
And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Just typically drowned in my car
It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
Than kissing all of my friends, you
Yeah it takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car
And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I've fucked everybody here
Yeah it takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
And I said "Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance
In the bar at the back of the hall?"
And I said "Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance
Dance at the back of the hall?"
Yeah it takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more than you
More, more
Yeah it takes a bit more
Yeah it takes a bit more
It takes a bit more, more
Yeah it takes a bit more, more
Yeah it takes a bit more, more
It takes a bit more
The stray lines
That unwind you
She does little things all right, I say that I've seen
She says meaning's incidental, 'cause she's so cool
She said I'm not a funny, funny boy, oh I
And now she's doing it, hard time
Yeah, she's doing it, hard time
Slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little beer on the sly
Shows what she's up to
She's not talking about it, she's listening
And while I read your lips, only a couple of lines
And now she's doing it, hard time
Yeah she's doing it, hard time
Yeah she's doing it, hard time
Yeah she's doing it, hard time
Yeah she's doing it, hard time
