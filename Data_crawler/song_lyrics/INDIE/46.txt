Song Name: Chocolate
Hey now, call it a split, because you know that you will
Oh, oh, you bite your friends like chocolate
You said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Now run, run away from the boys in blue
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, I think about what to do
I think about what to say
I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it
Oh, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said, we're dressed in black from head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
And we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Hey now, we're building up speed as we're approaching a hill
Oh, my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now, you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, go!
And play it cool
Oh, you said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
We're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go, oh no
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
We go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
We're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, no, no
Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
