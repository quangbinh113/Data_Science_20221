Song Name: Green Grass
Hey
How's your life?
Yeah, mine's alright
Oh, I'm doing fine
(It's just life, honey)
Well, hey
I'm having a bad day
So tell me it's okay
Sometimes it's just that way
My mama said 'The grass is always greener where you water it
Go and fill your diet up with greens, and reds, and oranges
Coffee goes cold, so you better drink all of it
Go and live your life, cause you know you were born for it'
You are not an image or a product or commodity
You aren't worth more because you like to eat broccoli
You're made up of your thoughts, habits, hopes, fears
And honestly, you're floating through space on a rock
Ain't that crazy?
So, go and live your life
What could go wrong?
Hey
So I fell on my face when I was walking through town earlier today
But then I stayed down, laying on the ground
Cause everyone looks so happy when they're upside-down
And, it got me wondering, what is this all about
We're just kids in the playground when the sun goes out, but
Am I instructions, what am I here to do
An existential crisis at twenty-two
My mama said 'The grass is always greener where you wanna be
You got to learn to love the ground you're standing on already
And coffee goes cold, but be grateful that there's any
Go and live your life, cause you've always been ready'
You are not an image or a product or commodity
You aren't worth more because you like to eat broccoli
You're made up of your thoughts, habits, hopes, fears
And honestly, you're floating through space on a rock
Ain't that crazy?
Ohh the grass will surely be greener
But why do we even need that goal?
For purple, pink, or even turquoise
Yellow, you're a dreamer
Oh, I remember, what my mama said
She knew just what I needed
She said 'The grass is always greener where you water it
Go and fill your diet up with greens, and reds, and oranges
Coffee goes cold, that's why you better drink all of it, honey
Go drink it up'
Cause, honey
You ain't an an image or a product or commodity
You aren't worth more because you like to eat broccoli
You're made up of your thoughts, habits, hopes, fears
And honestly, you're floating through space on a rock
Ain't that crazy?
(The grass is greener where you wanna be)
(It's just life, honey)
(The grass is greener where you wanna be)
(I love you, mama)
(It's just life, honey)
