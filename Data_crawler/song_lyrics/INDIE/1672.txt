Song Name: Porn Magazines
She doesn't like to get home on weekends
She only gets drunk during the days after work
And it's all so frustrating
So she finds comfort in her porn magazines
It's almost been 40 years after the eighties
And she is still into all that kind of stuff
And having babies for her's overrated
So she'd rather be alone
Yeah, she'd rather be alone
And she says that she's from nowhere
Nobody understands
There's no apparent reason why she doesn't have a home
Her parents say that she's the rebel one
That she's the rebel one
She's still not over her past toxic relationship
And she can't even eat when she thinks of him
And she has some serious issues with her mental health
But she's there to help a friend
She's there to help a friend
And she says that she's from nowhere
Nobody understands
There's no apparent reason why she doesn't have a home
Her parents say that she's the rebel one
That she's the rebel one
