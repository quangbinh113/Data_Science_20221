Song Name: Amber
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
I've got to tell you something
This phenomenon
I had to put it in a song and it goes like
Whoa
Amber is the color of your energy
Whoa
Shades of gold displayed naturally
You ought to know what brings me here
You glide through my head blind to fear and I know why
Whoa
Amber is the color of your energy
Whoa
Shades of gold displayed naturally
Whoa
Amber is the color of your energy
Whoa
Shades of gold displayed naturally
You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence, unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily, sometimes you've got to fight
Whoa
Amber is the color of your energy
Whoa
Shades of gold displayed naturally
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still, it's fine from afar, and you know that
Whoa
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa
I've got to tell you something
