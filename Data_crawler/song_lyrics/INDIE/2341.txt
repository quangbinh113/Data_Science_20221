Song Name: How to Be a Heartbreaker
Rule number one is that you gotta have fun
But, baby, when you're done, you gotta be the first to run
Rule number two, just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose, so le-let me tell you
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
At least I think I do
'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
Rule number three, wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve, unless you want to taste defeat
Rule number four, gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door, and leave him wantin' more, more
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
At least I think I do
'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
Girls, we do whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losin' in love again, babe
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him fallin' for a stranger, a player
Singin', "I lo-lo-love you"
'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
