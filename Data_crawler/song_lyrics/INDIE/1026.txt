Song Name: All time low slowed
I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right trough me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate
I (I, I)
I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie)
Lie, lie, lie, I try to hide, but now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
I was the prototype like three stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate
I (I, I)
I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie)
Lie, lie, lie, I try to hide, but now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
I (I, I)
I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie)
Lie, lie, lie, I try to hide, but now you know it
I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
(Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low-)
Lie, lie, lie, I try to hide, but now you know it
(Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low)
I'm at an all time, hey
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah)
Low, low, lo-lo-low, low, low, low, low (oh, woah, oh-oh)
