Song Name: i need to be alone.
I'm wasting my life on pointless things
I sometimes think
When does life begin
I'm falling out of conversations
I can't pay attention
Repeat the question
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
Oh oh, oh oh
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm waiting for something to change
'Cause everyday just feels the same
It's getting harder to exist
I don't want to feel like this
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
Oh oh, oh oh
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
I'm gonna lose my shit
I need to be alone
I need to be alone
I need to be alone
I'm wasting my life on pointless things
I sometimes think
When does life begin
I'm falling out of conversations
I can't pay attention
Repeat the question
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
I'm gonna lose my shit
I need to be alone
Or I'm gonna lose my shit
I'm gonna lose my shit
