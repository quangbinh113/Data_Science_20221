Song Name: Undercover Martyn
And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement people
To the basement
Many surprises await you
In the basement people
In the basement
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission

And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement people
To the basement
Many surprises await you
In the basement people
In the basement
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission
You hid there last time
You know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat
'Cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets
Completing your mission
