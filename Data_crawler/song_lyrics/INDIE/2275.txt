Song Name: more
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Said I gotta
Get money, swear I still love you
I don't wanna go, but you know that I have to
Touch road, gotta play shows
Crowd go wild for the shit I wrote
But this shit so-so, lose control
Gotta change up everything I know
Better, run ways when you smell that smoke
Better, hold me when my head gon' blow like
Hasta la vista
Dying to see ya in a dream that I had
Where I sing in arenas
Hasta la vista
Dying to see ya
Baby, it ain't so bad
When there's nothing between us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Gone so fast, all the bad habits not gon' last
Better run back, kid
Just so sad, worse than last year
Just might crash, just might crash
Just might
Everybody left, except for you and I
She don't want stories and lullabies
She don't understand that it's do or die
Said I can buy it all, but it's all a lie
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Getting low and I think I'm giving up
Baby, come home
I want us, I want us, said, "I want us"
