Song Name: Suffocate
This burden comes with a price
You can't afford to pay
The will of fire will burn
Get the fuck out!
I found the hate you locked away
It speaks in tongues a human couldn't replicate
You don't know yet what you are
It couldn't go, but it couldn't stay
Now it's throwing fuel into a bigger flame
I think we may have gone too far
You don't get what you deserve
No you get what you take
The will of fire will burn
And blow up in your face
The burden comes with a price
I don't think you can pay
The will of fire will burn
And it don't suffocate
The will of fire will burn
And it don't suffocate
Suffocate
And as I spin out of control
Every second takes me further down the rabbit hole
The devil now holds all the cards
He's listening, and taking hold
Digging his claws into a soul you never sold
You were his right from the start
You don't get what you deserve
No you get what you take
The will of fire will burn
And blow up in your face
The burden comes with a price
I don't think you can pay
The will of fire will burn
And it don't suffocate
This is our monster
The will of fire will burn
And it don't suffocate
