Song Name: The Night Has Missed Me
I always think, I'm somewhere else
Points I've never passed, ain't it spooky?
To fall far, into the mind
Memories alone couldn't sooth me
Once you're, calling I see you try
Too hard, at keeping me on the line
Pull string, puppet of sin
I always did, always will I
Look sharp, late in the afternoon
Come dark, howling here at the moon
The pack grins, circling in
I always win I always win
Cos you are cos you are complicit
To every little crime that I've committed
Cos you hold cos you hold no mystery
Every time I see the night has missed me
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Et la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit
I always shout, I know i'm loud
At my best where no hush can find me
Lonely child
Why d'you find
The gait of the dawn so funny?
Once you're, calling I see you try
Too hard, at keeping me on the line
Pull string, puppet of sin
I always did, always will I
Look sharp, late in the afternoon
Come dark, howling here at the moon
The pack grins, circling in
I always win I always win
Cos you are cos you are complicit
To every little crime that I've committed
Cos you hold cos you hold no mystery
Every time I see the night has missed me
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit m'a manqué
Et la nuit m'a manqué
Tu sais que la nuit
Once you're, calling I see you try
Too hard, at keeping me on the line
Pull string, puppet of sin
I always did, always will I
Look sharp, late in the afternoon
Come dark, howling here at the moon
The pack grins, circling in
I always win I always win
Cos you are cos you are complicit
To every little crime that I've committed
Cos you hold cos you hold no mystery
Every time I see the night has missed me
Cos you are cos you are complicit
To every little crime that I've committed
Cos you hold cos you hold no mystery
Every time I see the night has missed me
