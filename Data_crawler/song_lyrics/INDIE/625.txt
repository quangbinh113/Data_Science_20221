Song Name: Save My Grave
You make my eyes see brighter days
Feel as if you run through my veins
Wonderin' if the way
I'll arrive to my death
Is late, drunk and in love
Late, drunk and in love
(Late, drunk-)
I'm asking you if I may
Take a piece of you away?
I'm wondering if the way
I'll arrive to my death
Is late, drunk and in love
Late, drunk and in love
So, I'll be here waiting
Until my heart is shaking
In the mess you made me
My demons overtake me
I'm honestly breaking
Like the promises you made me
Never wanted it to end up this way
Save my grave
Save my grave
Save my, save my grave
(Save my grave)
I was not okay
To walk away
I was afraid
You wouldn't follow me
(Follow me)
Or maybe
You were only trynna take me high
So high
Daydream
You give me the wings to fly so high
Lately, I'm feelin' terrified
So I
Let my mind
Fight me in the darkest night
So I'll be here waiting
Until my heart is shaking
In the mess you made me
My demons overtake me
I'm honestly breaking
Like the promises you made me
Never wanted it to end up this way
Save my grave
Save my, save my grave
Save my, save my grave
Save my, save my grave
(Save my, save my grave)
(INSTRUMENTAL)
I was not okay
To walk away
I was afraid
You wouldn't follow me
