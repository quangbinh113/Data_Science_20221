Song Name: Eyes Blue Like The Atlantic, Pt. 2 (feat. Powfu, Alec Benjamin & Rxseboy)
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue, like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
I'm going down 'cause I was down for you
Lookin' like a clown for you
Surround sound speakers shook the ground while he was pounding you
And that's a lot to take in, huh
I heard the noise through the door, I had to break in
Shock up on your faces
Both of you were naked
Multiple occasions
Y'all were getting busy while I'm busy at my day shift
You kept the briefcases
Situation tasteless
Even hooked up with the dude while you were jamming to my playlist
Wow, hey Alexa, I'ma off 'em
Maybe run away because I'm sick of all the problems
Going down and I can't even see the bottom
But I promise I'ma find it once I finish up this bottle
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
Yeah, I'm still going down, I'll be falling for a long time
Eyes so innocent, I didn't know you had a bad side
Yeah, it's kinda weird, these emotions all attacking me
I don't want the answer, but how long this been happening?
Deep down, see the sea ground, I'm getting close
I don't wanna sit and whine, we already toast
I love this show, but I won't see the second season
It won't be the same with my favorite person leaving
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
And so the story goes, love grows and then it gets cut down
Then crumbles like a rose and decomposes in the ground
It's tragic I suppose, like dominoes how it goes down
The teardrops on the clothes, the beer knocked all over the ground
But fear not, there's no fear, my dear, 'cause here it all works out
The clothes will dry, the tears will disappear, and from the ground
A rose will rise, and from the skies the sun will break the clouds
A rose will rise and blue skies will surround
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
Eyes blue, I'm still going down now
Going down
Eyes blue, I'm still going down now
Going down
