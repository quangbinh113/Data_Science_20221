Song Name: Pull
You look so tired like you've been driving all day
Less is more each second as the light melts away
Strange construction, could they put up a sign?
There's always something changing and I don't even know why
Are you okay man? Have you changed your wire?
You'd rather ignore living than confront who hangs in your mind
Somethings got in your head
I feel the pull on your side of bed
I know you don't want to put up a fight
So we don't have to
Somethings got in your head
I see the means that lead to an end
And I can tell that you don't want to fight
So we don't have to
December felt good for once in a while
I got a new shade, a new paint, a new buff, a redesign
You've been such a stranger, you live on your isle
Landfill of heavy weight guilt for all your desire
Somethings got in your head
I feel the pull on your side of bed
I know you don't want to put up a fight
So we don't have to
Somethings got in my head
I see the means that lead to an end
You know I don't want to put up a fight
So do we have to?
