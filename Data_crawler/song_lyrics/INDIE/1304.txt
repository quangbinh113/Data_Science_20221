Song Name: Kissing Lessons
Rachel was a year older when I was in the second grade
I thought she might know everything
I took her word like a golden ring
I asked her how to win my man, and she said, "I know just the thing"
Gave me lip gloss and a hair toss
And, after school, a lesson in kissing
She called me by the name of her crush
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her "baby" or "darling" most the time
We'd take turns being seduced
Imagining the day it would come into use
Imagining the day we'd start breaking hearts and taking names
She wanted a three-story house
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father, children and their father
Three sons and a beautiful daughter, oh-oh-oh
Rachel's family moved out of town
I don't remember when we stopped hanging out
But I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet
And wonder if she thinks of me as her first kiss
