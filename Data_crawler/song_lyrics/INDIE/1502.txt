Song Name: Different Kind of World
One last song, I'll sing a song
And make it a song for peace
Though we all may carry on
May we do so decently
My hands are shaking, palms are sweating
Thinking 'bout the state of the world
But when we're riding all together
I'm a different kind of girl
One last song, I'll write a song
And know that it's for you
That new friend I haven't met
With a different point of view
My knees are aching, back is breaking
Thinking 'bout the state of the world
When we're riding all together
It's a different kind of world
When we're riding all together
I'm a different kind of girl
When we're riding all together
I'm a different kind of girl
