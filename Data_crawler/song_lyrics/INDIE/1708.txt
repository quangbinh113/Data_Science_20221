Song Name: Sugar Rush
Sugar rush, sugar rush, sugar rush
I think about you every night
Sugar rush, leave your words on my tongue
I wanna taste your every line
Baby, you're forbidden fruit and that's why
(Just a little and I'm wanting more)
I can't ignore the sweetness
Baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't try
(Just a little and I'm wanting more)
I can't ignore the sweetness
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
You're forbidden fruit and that's why
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Every day I can't get enough
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
Sugar rush, sugar rush, sugar rush
You'll taste sweeter by my side
Sugar rush, candy crush, you're the one
I wanna taste you every time
(Just a little and I'm wanting more)
I can't ignore the sweetness
Baby, you're forbidden fruit and that's why
(Just a little and I'm wanting more)
I can't ignore the sweetness
Baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't try
(Just a little and I'm wanting more)
I can't ignore the sweetness
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
You're forbidden fruit and that's why
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Love that taste of your sugar rush
Every day I can't get enough
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
