Song Name: All Of The Time
All of the time (you gotta be)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (you gotta be)
All of the time
You never know when I'm feeling low
Never talk, you're laying low
Better off, I'm beaming up
(It's all alright, it's all alright)
Heaven ain't big enough
It's evident, I guess it's true
You never did what you had to do
(And if you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (keep telling me)
(It's all alright, it's all alright)
Why don't we talk in the morning?
Want you to need me, my love
Could it be easy for us?
(It's all alright)
Heaven ain't big enough
It's evident, I guess it's true
You never did what you had to do
(And if you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (keep telling me)
(It's all alright, it's all alright)
All of the time (you could've lied)
All of the time (I'm telling the truth)
All of the time (you're telling me)
(Strong enough, I'm strong enough, I'm)
All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (keep telling me)
(Strong enough, I'm strong enough, I'm)
All of the time (you gotta be)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (you gotta be)
All of the time
