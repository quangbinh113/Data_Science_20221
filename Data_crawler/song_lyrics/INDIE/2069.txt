Song Name: Days
Tear the page apart
Still not over you
Thinking 'bout the days
You weren't so far away
I don't know (I don't know what I)
What I'd do (what I'd do without)
Without you (without you, I'm such)
I'm such a fool (such a fool)
Hours turn to days
The moon still looks the same
Without you by my side
Can't find no peace of mind
I don't know (I don't know what I)
What I'd do (what I'd do without)
Without you (you, I'm such a fool)
I'm such a fool (such a fool)
