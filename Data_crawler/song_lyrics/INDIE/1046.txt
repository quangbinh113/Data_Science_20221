Song Name: Young
Another day goes by
And where was I?
Didn't think I'd still be here
Just to make things clear
What's the use?
I'm not talking sense
Call it a ruse
On myself
I wanted to go
I wanted to say
All things come to pass
With time
But I want everything now
To be all mine
You think it's all over
Get up and try again
You've got to act your age, darling
Before you fall back in
What's the use?
I'm not talking sense
Call it a ruse
On myself
I wanted to go
I wanted to say
All things come to pass
With time
But I want everything now
To be all mine
