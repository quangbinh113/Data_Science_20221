Song Name: I Dare You
I never wanted to get too close to you
But now it looks like I'm getting too close to you
My mom tries to catch me
But I know all the backstreets
There's a look that you give me, a switch
And my feet melt, and the words just slip
Don't know what I'm sayin'
But I know I'm not playin'
You're gonna fall, but I'll catch you
You're gonna fall, but I'll catch you
You're gonna fall, but I'll catch you
(Ooh)
Come on and jump, well, I dare you
Come on and jump, well, I dare you
Come on and jump, well, I dare you
(Come on and jump, well, I dare you!)
The stains on your sweater
You think you know better
But you're a child, and it's kinda wild
How you're the one that brings the sun
I can't seem to sleep, and
I feel my pulse beating
And I wanna keep all my control
But you're the one that brings the sun
The dimple on your cheek and the wrinkle on your hand
They're sayin' you're gonna be my man
And there's somethin' about you
I just love how they doubt you
I never wanted to hold a lie for you
I never wanted to make you cry
But you run me in circles
And I can't keep my eyes closed
The stains on your sweater
You think you know better
But you're a child, and it's kinda wild
How you're the one that brings the sun
Can't seem to sleep, and
I feel my pulse beating
And I wanna keep all my control
But you're the one that brings the sun
You're gonna fall, but I'll catch you
You're gonna fall, but I'll catch you
Come on and jump, well, I dare you
(Come on and jump, well, I dare you!)
The stains on your sweater
You think you know better
But you're a child, and it's kinda wild
How you're the one that brings the sun
I can't seem to sleep, and
I feel my pulse beating
And I wanna keep all of my control
But you're the one that brings the sun
