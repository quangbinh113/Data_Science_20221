Song Name: 100 Bad Days
Remember when we all got drunk
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my god, I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my god, I felt so alone, lucky me

When all is going wrong, and you're scared as hell

Whatcha gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
(Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
Remember when she broke my heart
Waiting for the waiter to return my card
Right as I let down my guard, lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?

When all is going wrong, and you're scared as hell

Whatcha gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
(Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
(Screw your thing, it goes like this!)
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
