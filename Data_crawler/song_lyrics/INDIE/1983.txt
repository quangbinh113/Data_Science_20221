Song Name: t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l feat. Travis Barker
One, two, three, four
I don't fucking know if it's a lie or it's a fact
All your little fake friends will sell your secrets for some cash
Smile in my face, then put your cig' out on my back
If you ever see me, just get to runnin' like The Flash
I knew a boy just like you
He's a snake, just like you
Such a fake, just like you
But I can see the truth
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
I don't fucking know if it's paradise or it's a trap
Yeah, they're treating me like royalty, but is it kissin' ass?
No one's brave enough to take the fall right
But it's all your fault
Why you actin' like it's alright?
I knew a girl just like you
She was vain, just like you
Such a pain, just like you
And everybody knows the truth
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
It's clear to me now
You're scared of me, wow
It's clear to me now (transparent soul)
It's clear to me now
You're scared of me, wow
It's clear to me now (transparent soul)
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
