Song Name: Cleaner Air
I was born and raised
I don't know where
She's from Florida
Probably breathing cleaner air
You'd think I
Move like such a scum
That's why you
Always fucking run
Went to London
Finally had the funds, felt like I
Was always on the run
I move fast anyway
But I love you anyday
I lost my glasses at the pub
Went apeshit
You can ask man I went nuts
Three senses left when I stopped seeing
You already killed of my feelings
When I came home
Didn't want to socialize
I had things that I could not vocalize
Here's my two cents don't go baby
Cause if you leave I'll go crazy
