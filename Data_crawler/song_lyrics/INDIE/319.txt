Song Name: Face To Face
I love that new dress you bought
Yeah you sure look nice
Heard you liked that new restaurant
I know I've been there twice
And the way that you switch up your hair
All of the moments we've shared
Strolling the streets back in Rome
Oh, how I wish I was there
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair

I'm in my bed sitting, talking to screens all day
But I can't seem to say what's on my brain
But I wonder, I wonder
If you would feel the same
If one day we'd meet face to face
I messaged you yesterday
Haven't heard back yet
Did I do something wrong?
Or is it something I said?
And it hurts me inside
'Cause it's killing my pride
To see you reply to all of these other guys
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
I'm in my bed sitting, talking to screens all day
But I can't seem to say what's on my brain
But I wonder, I wonder
If you would feel the same
If one day we'd meet face to face
I'm in my bed sitting, talking to screens all day
I know you don't even know my name
But I wonder, I wonder
If you would feel the same
If one day we'd meet face to face
