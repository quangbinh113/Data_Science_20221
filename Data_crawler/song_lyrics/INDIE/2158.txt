Song Name: Grapevine
If а man can't see his shadow
Oh, he can block your sun all day
He can make you small
He has the power to take his love away
Six hours on the grapevine
And I feel kidnapped this time
'Cause my baby thinks
He always believes that he's always right
But I still think of him at night
Ooh, you know I would
Go back to the camp with the kerosene lamps in the woods
Ooh, when you were mine
And I was yours for а time
On the grapevine
On the grapevine
California's my body
And your fire runs over me
My car broke down in an old ghost town
Right around where they got James Dean
Emotional cowboy
With no hat and no boots
He stayed up all night
Trying to beat up the moon
Ooh, you know I would
Go back to the camp with the kerosene lamps in the woods
Ooh, when you were mine
And I was yours for а time
On the grapevine
On the grapevine
Don't know when I'm gonna see you, boy
Oh, I've been waiting for the time
When I see the light shining across the freeway late at night
Start to drift over the land, and it hits me for the first time
Now we're just two cars passing by on the grapevine
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
On the grapevine
On the grapevine
