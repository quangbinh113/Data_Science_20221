Song Name: Fellowship
My friends, my friends, my friends
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends, my f-
Our breezy Sunday afternoons
Christmas films in July with you
The canon of Baltimore tales
Our crafty looks when there's nothing to wear
Maybe it's the blessing of my 30's
I'm spending less time worrying and more time recounting the love
More time recounting the love
Fellow, la-la-la, la-la
Fellow, la-la-la, la-la
Fellow, la-la-la, la-la
And I'm so thankful for
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends, my f-
Our fascination with Prosecco
The silly face you make when I say, "Hello"
I never understood deep, deep breaths (ah-ha)
'Til you came around and you just changed the way I laughed
This is the blessing of my 30's
I'm spending less time worrying and more time recounting the love
And I'm so thankful for (for)
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends
My friends (my friends), my friends (my friends)
I'm thankful for the love I share with my friends, my f-
