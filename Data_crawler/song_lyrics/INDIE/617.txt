Song Name: National Anthem
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool but, I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow, down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now? Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (kiss, kiss)
I sing the national anthem while I'm standin'
Over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He said to be cool but, I'm already coolest
I said to get real, "Don't you know who you're dealing with?"
"Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?"
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow, down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now? Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem, boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed, babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow, down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now? Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
