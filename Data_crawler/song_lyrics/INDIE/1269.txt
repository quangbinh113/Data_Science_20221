Song Name: Oh No
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Oh no, I did it again
I let my mind leak out into all my friends
And now I'm lonely
Sitting and sink in the blue
Oh no, I did it again
I let myself inside, 'til the silence ends
I hope you call me
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
'Cause I'm caving out
And I just sit back
While I watch me drown
So I'm safe and sound
While I'm in this room
No, it's nothing new
Ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Oh no, I did it again
I tell the world I'm fine, never near the edge
And now I'm falling
Too late to tell the truth
Oh no, I did it again
I heard them all too loud, voices in my head
And now I'm lonely
Someone to tell me thеy knew
'Cause I'm caving out
And I just sit back
While I watch mе drown
So I'm safe and sound
While I'm in this room
No, it's nothing new
Ooh-ooh (oh no)
'Cause I'm caving out
And I just sit back
While I watch me drown (oh no)
So I'm safe and sound
While I'm in this room
No, it's nothing new
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
Slipping and thinking of you
