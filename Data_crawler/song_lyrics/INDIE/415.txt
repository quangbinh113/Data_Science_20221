Song Name: Truce
Now the night is coming to an end
The sun will rise and we will try again
Stay alive, stay alive for me

You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
I will fear the night again
I hope I'm not my only friend
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
