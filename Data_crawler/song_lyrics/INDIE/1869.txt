Song Name: HeatDeath
I'm scared
Of my demise
An outline
With empty eyes
I try
(Isn't it painful?) To keep my lungs from caving in too deep
I find
(Isn't it lovely?) It gets harder to pin my lips and smile
Our minds
Are lost in space
Arms splayed
In ugly ways
The stars
(Isn't it frightening?) Burn out their lives down to their tiny cores
Why try
(Isn't it useless?) To fight against the ebb and flow?
No eyes, no ears
No nose, no tongue
No body, no mind
No color, sound
No smell, no taste
No touch, no realm of eyes
No eyes, no ears
No nose, no tongue
No body, no mind
No color, sound
No smell, no taste
No touch, no realm of eyes
