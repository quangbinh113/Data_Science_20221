Song Name: Bittersweet
Take me out, make me believe that
We could watch a million sunsets
Hug me with your words
Before you go and I get hurt
Summer nights, better together
We both act like it's forever
Oh it's bittersweet
But we know this is what we need
Here we go
I got myself caught up again in
Love so bittersweet
Bittersweet
Caught myself in love again
Oh no, bittersweet
Caught myself in love again
Oh no, bittersweet
Hold me a little closer
Whisper things you wouldn't ever say if you were sober
Why don't we just plan a trip to Paris in October
We don't have to end this when the summer days are over, no oh
So tell me how you're feeling
Tell me all your fears and things you secretly believe in
When's the last time you fell in love?
Baby, maybe I could be enough
Here we go
I got myself caught up again in
Love so bittersweet
Bittersweet
Caught myself in love again
Oh no, bittersweet
Caught myself in love again
Oh no, bittersweet
Caught myself in love again
Oh no, bittersweet
