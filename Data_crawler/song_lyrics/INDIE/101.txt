Song Name: Somebody Easier
If I showed you my true colors
And you saw who I am
Would you love me with my demons, as hard as you can?
It's okay if you hate it, I understand
You can find somebody easier, I'll find love where I can
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
If I showed you my true colors
And you saw who I am
Would you love me with my demons, as hard as you can?
It's okay if you hate it, I understand
You can find somebody easier, I'll find love where I can
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
Somewhere there's someone for me
If I showed you my true colors
And you saw who I am
Would you love me with my demons, as hard as you can?
It's okay if you hate it, I understand
You can find somebody easier, I'll find love where I can
