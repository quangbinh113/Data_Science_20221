Song Name: Meet Me At Our Spot
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot
Caught a vibe (woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
When I go to sleep
I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older, I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(Meet me at our spot)
We caught a vibe (yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (all night)
Maybe we can take a drive (take a drive)
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Caught a vibe (woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride (the ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (woo, woo!)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
