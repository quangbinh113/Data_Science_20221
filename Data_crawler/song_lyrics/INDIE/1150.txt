Song Name: Suitcase Heart
Lying in your bed
Can almost rest my head
I wish that we could stay this way
But one day
I know I will fly away
I got a suitcase heart
Was gone before it even starts
Before you even have a chance to
Leave a mark
I'll pack up my suitcase heart
The things you love the most
The restless heart can't get too close
One day, you'll finally know
I must fly away
I got a suitcase heart
Was gone before it even starts
Before you even have a chance to
Leave a mark
I'll pack up my suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
They say you don't know me anymore
You'll see me walking out of the door
So tell me
Have you loved someone before
With a suitcase heart
Was gone before it even starts
Before you even have a chance to
Leave a mark
I'll pack up my suitcase heartBefore you even have a chance to
Leave a mark
I'll pack up my suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
Before you even have a chance to
Leave a mark
I'll pack up my suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
Suitcase heart
