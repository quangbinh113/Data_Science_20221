Song Name: Care For You
Baby, I care for you
But don't let me in
Baby, I'll lie to keep them away from you
Don't let me in, don't let me die
'Cause only if I never believed
You wanted to run naturally
Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you
Just to show you that I care for you
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
Baby, I care for you
So don't make me go dancing alone
I'll wait by the stairs for you
Wrapped up in smoke, laughing alone
'Cause only if I ever believed
I wanted to run naturally
Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you
Just to show you that I care for you
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
