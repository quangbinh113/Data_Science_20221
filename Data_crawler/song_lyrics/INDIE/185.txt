Song Name: Crash My Car
Walk in like a wrecking ball
The way she moves makes you miserable
All eyes on the golden girl
She's gonna tell you, gonna tell you
Gonna tell you that you're too sweet
Swan dive to the concrete floor
The pavement never felt so warm
One look and you already know
She's gonna cut you, gonna cut you,
Gonna cut you, cut you real deep
Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Anything you want
You can crash my car tonight
Go out wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
Dead last as a drama queen
But I found myself in the front seat of her car
She's not blood royalty, but that's fine
Yeah, that's alright with me
Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Light me up and lay me down
And love me like you shouldn't now
You can crash my car tonight
Go out wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely, lonely
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
You can crash my car tonight
Go out wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely, lonely
Crash my car
Take all my money and run
Baby, if that's what you want, (lonely, lonely)
I said crash my car
Take all my money and run
Baby, if that's what you want, (lonely, lonely, oh)
