Song Name: Flaming Hot Cheetos
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly, it's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic, I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive or something
Live in the moment, that's what they tell me
But what ever happened to when you would hold me
And hold me, and hold me
Girlfriend or girl that's a friend?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real, it's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore, that even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't afford
