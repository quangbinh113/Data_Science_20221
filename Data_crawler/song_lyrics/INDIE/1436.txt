Song Name: Tiptoeing
How you gonna make me do this dance again
We're getting closer but we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
When we met I wasn't interested
I did half a glance
Didn't want to chance it
Now I lie awake and I think about you
Because there's a moral to this story but I don't know it
Always listen to myself but not this time I guess
Keep on running from it
But I want it
I do
How you gonna make me do this dance again
We're getting closer but we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
I drag my heels 'cause I just can't walk away
Fantasising if you want to you could stay
And be my baby but our hearts might break
So we keep tiptoeing
It's forbidden but I still want you
I wanna taste the fruit
But I just can't chance it
So much at risk and I'm scared to lose
And there's a moral to the story but I've lost my head
There's a million different secrets we should leave unsaid
Should be running from it
But I want it
I do
How you gonna make me do this dance again?
We're getting closer but we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
I drag my heels 'cause I just can't walk away
Fantasising if you want to you could stay
And be my baby but our hearts might break
So we keep tiptoeing
Tiptoes, tiptoes
You got me on my tiptoes, tiptoes
We want to but we both know, both know
There's too much to lose
How you gonna make me do this dance again?
We're getting closer but we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
I drag my heels 'cause I just can't walk away
Fantasising if you want to you could stay
And be my baby but our hearts might break
So we keep tiptoeing
Tiptoes, tiptoes
You got me on my tiptoes, tiptoes
We want to but we both know, both know
There's too much to lose
