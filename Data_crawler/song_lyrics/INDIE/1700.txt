Song Name: build a life
Is it wrong to feel alone
In a room full of people
'Cause they don't know me like you do me
All these times I've felt so close
To understanding why I feel this way
But then I fall and crumble back into a million pieces
And then you pick me up (pick me up)
And you hold me close (hold me close)
Yeah, you hold me closer than I've ever held myself before
I've never held myself like this before
I wanna build a life with you
I wanna build my life with you
I wanna be the one you call
When you're feeling small
When you're feeling gone
I wanna laugh and cry with you
I wanna build my life with you
You're gonna be the one I call
When I'm feeling small
When I'm feeling gone
Is it wrong to fake a smile
For a sec, they won't notice
But when it comes to you, I just can't hide
In your gaze I feel so safe
Understanding it's okay to feel this way
And then I trust fall into every single beautiful mistake
'Cause when you'll pick me up
And you'll hold me close
Yeah, you hold me closer than I've ever held myself before
I've never held myself like this before
Breathe in your company
You taught me what love means
I need your company
Build a life, set me free
I wanna build a life with you (I wanna build a life with you)
I wanna build my life with you
I wanna be the one you call when you're feeling small
When you're feeling gone
I wanna laugh and cry with you (I wanna laugh and cry with you)
I wanna build my life with you
I wanna build a life
I wanna build a life
I wanna build a life with you
I wanna build a life with you
I wanna build my life with you
I wanna be the one you call
When you're feeling small
When you're feeling gone
I wanna laugh and cry with you
I wanna build my life with you
You're gonna be the one I call
When I'm feeling small
When I'm feeling gone
Is it wrong to feel alone
In a room full of people
'Cause they don't know me like you do me
