Song Name: Hey, Ma
I waited outside

I took it remote
I wanted a bath

"Tell the story or he goes
Tell the story or he goes"
Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
I waited outside
I was toking on dope
I hoped it all won't go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
I took it, it was right
Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
(Hey Ma, Hey Ma, Hey Ma)
I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk 'till dawn
Let me talk to em
Let me talk to em all
Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
