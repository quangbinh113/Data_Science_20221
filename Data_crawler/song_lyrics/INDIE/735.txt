Song Name: Oh Ana
I'll be God
I'll be God
I'll be God
I'll be God, today
Hold my head under the bath and breathe away
Slit my wrists and watch that blood evaporate
Being this Godly can't be good for
Ana save me
Ana hear me
I'll play God
I'll play God
I'll play God
I'll play God, today
Ante up and play that God a poker game
Walk away with all our little God's spare change
Playing this God it can't be good for
Ana's safety
Ana hear me
Oh, Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill
I'll fake God
I'll fake God
I'll fake God
I'll fake God today
Hop up on a cloud and watch the world decay
Ana on my shoulders and we'll laugh away
Faking this God it can't be good for
Ana's safety
Ana hear me
Ana baby
I'm not crazy
Oh Ana, oh Ana, oh Ana
I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill
Kill
Kill
Kill
Kill
Oh Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill
Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that
I couldn't kill
I couldn't kill
I couldn't kill
I couldn't kill
No, I couldn't kill
No, I couldn't kill
No, I couldn't kill, Ana
Oh, Ana
