Song Name: Paper Planes
You and I were building castles in the air without looking back
Now I tell you all the things that I don't really want to think about
'Cause love is harder than it used to be
And time runs faster than we pictured it
I'm looking at you like it's us but I know there's a change of heart
At my side of the bed
At the edge of every night
When you're asleep, my mind
Tends to wander off sometimes TO
All our dreams and all our desires
Are paper planes in front of our eyes
Everything we've always believed in
Will it hold us back?
'Cause love is harder than it used to be
And life is nothing like we pictured it
Who are we to blame ourselves for moving on
To become someone
We were so happy on the move, and we ran
Couldn't slow down
And though I know these are the hands I could belong to
My legs are tired
We're not the people that we used to be
Still trying to find out who we want to be
You're looking at me and you know
Like we already shared the words
At my side of the bed
At the edge of every night
When you're asleep my mind
Tends to wander off sometimes to
All our dreams and all our desires
Are paper planes in front of our eyes
And everything we've always believed in
Will it hold us back?
'Cause love is harder than it used to be
And life is nothing like we pictured it
Who are we to blame ourselves for moving on
To become someone
To become someone
'Cause love is harder than it used to be
And life is nothing like we pictured it
Who are we to blame ourselves for moving on
