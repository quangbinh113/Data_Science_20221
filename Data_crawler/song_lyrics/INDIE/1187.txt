Song Name: Would You Be So Kind
I have a question
It might seem strange
How are your lungs?
Are they in pain?
'Cause mine are aching
Think I know why
I kinda like it though
You wanna try?
Oh, would you be so kind
As to fall in love with me?
You see, I'm trying
I know you know that I like you
But that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love
I think it's only fair
There's gotta be some butterflies somewhere (wanna share?)
'Cause I like you but that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love with me
Let's write a story
Be in my book
You've got to join me on my page
At least take a look
Oh, where are your manners?
You need some time?
Let's swap chests today
That might help you decide
Oh, would you be so kind
As to fall in love with me?
You see, I'm trying
I know you know that I like you
But that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love
I think it's only fair
There's gotta be some butterflies somewhere (wanna share?)
'Cause I like you but that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love with me
Oh, do me a favour
Can your heart rate rise a little?
Do me a favour
Can your heart rate rise a little?
Do me a favour
Can your heart rate rise a little?
Do me a favour
Oh, would you be so kind
As to fall in love with me?
You see, I'm trying
I know you know that I like you
But that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love
I think it's only fair
There's gotta be some butterflies somewhere (wanna share?)
'Cause I like you but that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love
Oh I like you but that's not enough
So if you will
Please fall in love with me
