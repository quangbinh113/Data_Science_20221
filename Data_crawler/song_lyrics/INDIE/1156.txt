Song Name: We've Come so Far
All of my memories, like constellations
Spinning â€˜round in my head
So many miles, I still remember
And I still long for what's ahead
And we've come so far
All of the pictures, dreaming in color
The life we know will never fade
We've come so far
Yeah, we've come so far
All of my memories, wishes and whispers
Spinnin' round and round again
We've come so far
