Song Name: Bottom
Woah woah
Woah woah-oh-oh
Woah woah
Woah woah-oh-oh
Hey man I miss your collar bones
I love the way your skin feels on my collar bones
I know I stole that line
Steal all my lines from this guy named Brian
Hey man I miss your collar bones
I love the way your skin feels on my collar bones
I know I stole that line
Steal all my lines from this guy named Brian
You be the front
I'll be the back
And you sing like this
So I'll sing like that
You be the bottom
And I'll be the top
I'll put the lid on the jar when it's shut
The headlights and werewolves
Come out of the forest at night on your birthday
I know they adore us
But headlights and werewolves
Come out of the forest at night on your birthday
I know they I know they
But I feel the way that you stare
At the back of my neck
From the back of the porch
While you're mowing you're
I feel the way that you stare at the back of my neck
From the back of the porch
While you're mowing
Can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you help me take away the pain?
Can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you help me take away the pain?
Can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you break my legs tonight?
But I feel the way that you stare at the back of my neck
From the back of the porch
While you're mowing you're
I feel the way that you stare at the back of my neck
From the back of the porch
While you're mowing
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
Eh eh eh oh
I feel the way
That you stare at the back of my neck
From the back of the porch
While you're mowing
Can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Oh can you pay for overtime?
Can you pay to keep my secrets safe?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Can you break my legs tonight?
Oh fuck you!
