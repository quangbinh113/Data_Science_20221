Song Name: Sister
Everything you do I wanna do
Everything you know I wanna know
Talk about our secrets till the morning comes
Then you let me try on all your clothes
Even when you're saying that you hate me
I know that the feeling isn't true
If you killed somebody
No, I wouldn't tell nobody on you
I wanna be your sister
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your sister
'Til the end, 'til the end
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
If you ever go and get your heart broke
I would take a red eye plane
Ride or die forever
I got you (I got you)
Tell me that you really need a night out
I'd even put a dress on too
If somebody hurts you
Then I'm gonna kill somebody for you
I wanna be your sister
I wanna be your friend
(Do you wanna be)
I wanna be your sister
'Til the end, 'til the end
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
When you're drunk and you're cold
And you're much too high
When you're sitting all alone on a Friday night
When you can't decide what you're fighting for
I wanna be your
When you're lost and afraid
And you've crashed your car
When you need a friend to dance in the dark
When you call me up
I'll be at your door
I wanna be your sister
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna be mine?
