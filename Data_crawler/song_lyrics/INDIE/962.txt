Song Name: Work Out
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me
Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, is it the real thing?
Or is it just a one night stand?
Well then
Let me see you get high and go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you
(Work out for me, work out for me)
High, and go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you
(Work out for me, work out for me)
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ride around town in the big old Range
I knew her when I rocked big old jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big old things
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to her, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught it off the backboard
I told her, baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life take a chance roll a dice
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink, just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night
Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, is it the real thing?
Or is it just a one night stand?
Well then
Let me see you get high and go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you
(Work out for me, work out for me)
High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you
(Work out for me, work out for me)
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it's your world
On my Martin shit, you go girl
She bad and she know it, some niggas save hoes
I'm not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool, me I'm on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight
Tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass get right
Get right
Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, is it the real thing?
Or is just a one night stand
Well then (Cole World)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever?
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey)
Straight up I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together
Oh, oh, oh
Come here girl, lets get it on
(Work out for me, work out for me)
Straight up now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever?
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a hit and run
Well, straight up I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together
Oh, oh, oh
Come here girl lets get it on
(Work out for me, work out for me)
