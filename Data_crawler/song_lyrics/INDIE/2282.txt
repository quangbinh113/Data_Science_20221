Song Name: Femme Fatale
Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down
What a clown
'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The thing she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're put down in her book
You're number thirty-seven, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool
Yes, it's true
'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The thing she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The thing she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
Oh-woah-woah
(She's a femme fatale)
Oh-woah-woah
(She's a femme fatale)
Oh-woah-woah
(She's a femme fatale)
