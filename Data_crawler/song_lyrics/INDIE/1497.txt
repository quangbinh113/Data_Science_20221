Song Name: Miracles
I see great waves coming our way
Beautiful sunsets on lost and lonely days
Infinite futures become a single past
Everyone whimpers, nobody lasts
You say one day that we should have a baby, well
Right now, baby, I'm struggling, we'll see, yeah
You say one day that we should have a baby, well
God help me, I love you, I agree, yeah
After all, there's no way up from apathy, yeah
You and me, we got better pills than ecstasy
They're miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses, yeah
How many more songs am I supposed to write
Before I should turn it off and say goodnight?
How many more songs am I supposed to write
Before I can turn it off and say goodnight?
"I have fears that I have not addressed," she says
Some things from my past make me feel powerless, well
Baby, I pray for the children and the sinners and the animals too
And I, I pray for you
After all, there's no way up from apathy, yeah
You and me, we got better pills than ecstasy
They're miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses
Miracles and crosses, yeah
