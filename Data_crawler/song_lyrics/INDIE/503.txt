Song Name: Cupid
Pitch black
I'm on the opposite side of the fence
Sneaking out for a kiss, yeah
Just to tell you I like you
There ain't nobody like you
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it
Cupid got us fucked up
Drawing hearts on my skin
With our initials in it
Ain't it nice out here on the baseball field
When we're alone?
Press your lips against my neck
With me you don't pretend like
With your girlfriend
She's nice but she's not me
She's nice but hates me
Date me, I'm just playing
Didn't mean to say that
Sometimes kids say the dumbest things
But if you're down, then so am I
I can't lie
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah
And when we get older
And y'all break up someday
And this is not a secret
Maybe then you'll say you love me back
But until then I'll be dreaming about that
