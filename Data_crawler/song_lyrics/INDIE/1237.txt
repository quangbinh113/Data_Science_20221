Song Name: Romantic Homicide
I'm scared

It feels like you don't care
Enlighten me, my dear
Why am I still here?
I don't mean to be complacent with the decisions you made
But why?
Mm
In the back of my mind
You died
And I didn't even cry
No, not a single tear
And I'm sick of waiting patiently for someone that won't even arrive
Whoa
In the back of my mind
I killed you
And I didn't even even regret it
I can't believe I said it
But it's true
I hate you
