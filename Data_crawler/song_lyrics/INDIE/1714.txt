Song Name: Sunset on the Sea
Butterflies on my doorstep
Walking round in the crowded room
Somehow you never left though
I'm a mess no one does that before ur ur
Don't dream during the day
Just longing to get to you in every night
Beautiful your shadow
Magnify your mind
I look into your eyes when it meets the sun
(When it meets the sun)
I found you in a cup of tea
In every sunset on the sea
And love will come or it will go
But I will stay for forever and
More, more oo oo oo more more
More, more oo oo oo more more oo
More, more oo oo oo more more
More, more oo oo oo more more
More, more oo oo oo more more oo
A part of me felt like I rushed to jump the gun
Been training every Saturday for a month
I tried learning how to properly love someone
I saw my mom cry dying to be seen and
She ain't got none and I ain't got one
I was so frightened all I do is
Ain't got none and I ain't got one
I was so frightened all I do is run
And you make me feel like
I can't feel down under my heart what loss is found
Around my head remains the oath
I'm covered safe and sound
I found you in a cup of tea
In every sunset on the sea
And love will come or it will go but
I will stay for forever more
I found you in a cup of tea
In every sunset on the sea
I love you like a pouring rain
With every ounce that's in my veins
I long for life in every corner
And I found you there everywhere
And love will come and it will stay 'Cause
I'll remain for forever more and
(Moreeeeee) more more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
More more more or or or or
Forever
