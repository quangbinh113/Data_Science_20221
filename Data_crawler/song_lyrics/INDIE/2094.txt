Song Name: Wanderlust
Can you hear that knocking in your soul
No, no, you don't listen
Can you hear that knocking overload
No, no, you don't listen
Never see the high beyond the low
No wonder, you lay twitching
Do you share the rush to be alone
Come over, we'll go missing
We'll go where there's no snow
We'll go and they won't know
But just please don't give me your word
Do do do...
Can you hear that knocking in your soul
No wonder, you don't listen
We'll go where there's no snow
Just please don't give me your word
Do do do...
Just please don't give me your word
All that matters is the music tonight
Just please don't give me your word
All that matters is the music tonight
But you don't listen...
But you don't listen...
Ah you don't listen...
So, we'll go running, running til we start again
Yeah we'll run, we'll run away
Yeah, we'll go running, running til we start again
Yeah we'll run, we'll run away
Yeah, we'll go running, running til we start again
And we'll run, we'll run away
