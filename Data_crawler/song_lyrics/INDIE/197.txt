Song Name: Darlin'
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na

Hey
I don't think I'm ready, no
Not for that jelly, my honey like Winnie the Pooh
That strawberry got me very temporarily out of order in the booth
I don't got nothin' to do (hey)
Feel like I'm stuck in a loop (woo)
What's in your fridge? You ain't got water?
Okay then Henny will do (hey)
Pitiful, pitiful
I got rituals that I keep stickin' to
I got money that I should be gettin' to
But I just cannot get rid of you, rid of you, rid of you
I'm pitiful, pitiful
Havin' trouble with all my syllables
Yeah I love you but I'm so miserable, I'm so miserable, ooh
Raindrop keep fallin'
Don't know where my heart went
Don't tell me you lost it
Don't fuck with me, darlin'
Raindrop keep fallin'
My umbrella is garbage
But fuck it I'm gorgeous
So don't fuck with me, darlin'
Raindrop keep fallin'
Stuck in an apartment
I'm not that important
But don't fuck with me, darlin'
Rain keep fallin'
I beg your pardon
But you're just like poison
So don't fuck with me, darlin'
Treated you like the queen of Zamunda
Shoulda treated you like Freddy Kruger
I need blessings and Hallelelujahs
'Cause I don't know how I'ma get through you
Blue 42, oou
I feel like Tobi Lou (woo)
Breakfast for dinner, you ain't got milk?
Okay then Henny will do
I'm pitiful, pitiful
I got bitches that literally shit on you
But when I'm when 'em I just wanna get with you
Can I get rid of you? Rid of you, oou
I'm so pitiful, fuckin' up like all my syllables
Wish I could just paint a visual
I'm so sick of you
And the raindrop keep fallin'
Don't know where my heart went
Don't tell me you lost it
Don't fuck with me, darlin'
Raindrop keep fallin'
My umbrella is garbage
But I think I'm gorgeous
So don't fuck with me, darlin'
Raindrop keep fallin'
Stuck in an apartment
I'm not that important
But don't fuck with me, darlin'
Rain keep fallin'
I beg your pardon
But I think you're poison
So don't fuck with me, darlin'
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, that was great!
Darlin'
