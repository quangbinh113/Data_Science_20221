Song Name: Teenage Fantasy
You weren't the boy I thought I knew
Maybe I was blind, I was young
I didn't have a clue
You were the topic of my lunchtime
I'd bore the girls about our chats
And get upset when you didn't text back
I was warned by my brothers
To find another lover
Stop falling for these boys
Who didn't want the same as me
And I was warned by my brothers
To find another lover
Stop falling for these boys
Who didn't want the same as me
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
I've got a lot of things to do
What if I had been a fool and thought I was in love with you
I need to grow and find my self
Before I let somebody love me
'Cause at the moment I don't know me
When I was told by my father
If I look into the future
Do I really see this boy
That I think I've fallen for
And was told by my mother
If I look into the future
Do I really see this boy
That I think I've fallen for
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
When we are young
We all want someone
Who we think is the one
Just to fit in
There's no need to rush
Take your time
Life's a big old ride
Sit back and enjoy the vibe
When we are young
We all want someone
Who we think is the one
Just to fit in
There's no need to rush
Take your time
Life's a big old ride
Sit back and enjoy the vibe
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
