Song Name: Make A Move
Oh, hello there, would it be okay
If I asked you your name?
Or should I be ashamed
If I asked you your name?
'Cause I heard it's ugly to be forward
But cute to be lame
That's the rules of the game
But I don't wanna be lame
Thinking about you
Thinking about you
But am I allowed to?
Maybe this is news to you
But I've been told not to
Make a move
I'm done hesitating
Sick of waiting for you to
Make a move
Make a move
Make a move
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Would it be unladylike and manly
To message you first?
Would you think I'm the worst (would you think I'm)
If I messaged you first?
Thinking about you
Thinking about you
But am I allowed to?
Maybe this is news to you
But I've been told not to
Make a move
I'm done hesitating
Sick of waiting for you to
Make a move
Make a move
Make a move
And now I'm waiting
And now I'm waiting for you to
And now I'm waiting for you to
And now I'm waiting for you to
And now I'm
'Cause now
Thinking about you
Thinking about you
Thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Thinking about you
But am I allowed to?
Maybe this is news to you
But I've been told not to
Make a move
I'm done hesitating
Sick of waiting for you to
Maybe this is news to you
But I've been told not to, yeah
You know, I hate this game we're playing
And I'm not waiting for you to
(I'm not waiting for you to)
Make a move
Make a move
I'm not waiting for you to
I'm not waiting
Make a move
Make a move
I'm not waiting for you to
