Song Name: Want Me
I wish I thought that I was pretty so that I could turn you on
I had a dream you called me pretty and I told you you were wrong
And that I look for parts of you in every person that I meet
Because my brain is dissipated and you're where it used to be
And it's so typical of me to get so easily obsessed
But in my head we're in my bedroom and you're getting undressed
I wanna take you to a rock show and kiss you in a bathroom stall
I wanna tell you that you're mine and put you up against a wall
Like a painting or a poster of a teenage crush
I play it out inside my head as if you're with me on the bus
And we're talking and you wanna look inside my mind
I say you can't because I lost it when I knew you were alive
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Take me to places that I don't know
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Why don't you swap me for your shadow?
So I'll be everywhere that you'll be
And I'll go anywhere you want me
Yeah, I'll go anywhere you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
I'm 20 something so I tell myself to just grow up
Ditch my pathetic fascination with this unrequired love
I spent the whole day trying to convince myself
You're nothing special, you're like everybody else
And I stay home 'cause all my friends are getting bored of me
I find a way to fit your name in every sentence that I speak
I swear to God, I'm not insane
But all the flags are red
If I'm lying on the floor
Typing your name into the internet
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Take me to places that I don't know
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Why don't you swap me for your shadow?
So I'll be everywhere that you'll be
And I'll go anywhere you want me
Yeah, I'll go anywhere you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Je ne parle même pas vraiment français
Mais je le traduis un peu pour avoir l'air
Romantique, dangereux et mystérieux
Je pense que ma voix sur le rap est jolie comme ça
Je me suis dis que tu m'aimerais mieux
Je ferai tout c'que tu veux qu'je fasse
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Take me to places that I don't know
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Why don't you swap me for your shadow?
So I'll be everywhere that you'll be
And I'll go anywhere you want me
Yeah, I'll go anywhere you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me, if you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
No offense but it makes no sense
You're in her bed then you're driving home and playing my cassette
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
All your friends are 29 years old
Now I'm in debt because I'm just a kid
Now you're smoking cigarettes
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
Be my guest, go on and waste your life inside her bed now
I bet you get bored having sex
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
No offense but it makes no sense
You're in her bed then you're driving home and playing my cassette
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
All your friends are 29 years old
And I'm in debt because I'm just a kid
Now you're smoking cigarettes
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
Be my guest, go on and waste your life inside her bed now
I bet you get bored having sex
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
Yep
