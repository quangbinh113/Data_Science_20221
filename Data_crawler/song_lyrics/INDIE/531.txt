Song Name: makeup drawer
I like your makeup for love
Where'd you get your foundation
Ooh, la-la-la
You're so, so pretty
Yeah, lots of colors to choose from
Just like our situation
Ooh, la-la-la
Oh
It's such a pity
You could wear nothing above
Your surface and you look good
I don't know how you do it
I don't know how you do it
I could be hiding beneath
But you wouldn't even know
The shit that I've been doin'
That I've been doin'
And I know where you'll be
You locked the door to my makeup drawer
And you know where I'll be
Rummage galore through my makeup drawer
Mistakes were made to let go
I tried to lay down my law
Ooh, la-la-la
It's so, so pretty
I shattered mirrors to cope
You made me hate what I saw
Ooh, la-la-la
Oh
It's such a pity
You could wear nothing above
Your surface and you look good
I don't know how you do it
I don't know how you do it
I could be hiding beneath
But you wouldn't even know
The shit that I've been doin'
That I've been doin'
And I know where you'll be
You locked the door to my makeup drawer
And you know where I'll be
Rummage galore through my makeup drawer
I just don't know
And just don't care
You chew my skull
I watch and stare
Make sure you're fine
Expose my life
I hope you have a real fun time
And I know where you'll be
You locked the door to my makeup drawer
And you know where I'll be
Rummage galore through my makeup drawer
So hold your breath and close your eyes
Forget the makeup drawer
And you know where I'll be
Rummage galore
Through my makeup drawer
Ooh, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la (Rumage galore)
Ooh, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la-la
