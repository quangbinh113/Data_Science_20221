Song Name: I Don't Recognise You
Held up in my room
It's just another Monday
Then you burst through the door and you tell me that you love me
But there's a madness in your eyes
And you're trying to disguise
That you're really not alright
Now four bare walls surround you
You're going through hell
Can't seem to find a way through
Floating down the Styx
Please tell me it's a trick
Because you like to joke around
Please tell me that you're joking now
And that you'll get out of this
That you'll get out of this
The strange nights, they're messing with your mind
But they don't scare you
You don't want to be left behind
Now I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
Held up in my room
It's just another Friday
Then you call me up and you tell me there's a party
But something isn't right
You did the same shit last night
But you say that you're alright
Now your head is reeling
The walls are melting
You're losing feeling
But do you want to escape
What needs to go away?
Why do you want to waste your time?
Why do you want to lose your mind?
And you won't even try
No, you won't even try
The strange nights, they're messing with your mind
But they don't scare you
You don't want to be left behind
Now I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
(Now I don't recognize you)
(Now I don't recognize you)
(Now I don't recognize you)
The strange nights, they're messing with your mind
But they don't scare you
You don't want to be left behind
Now I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
No, I don't recognize you
