Song Name: Black Out Days - Future Islands Remix
Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind

You should save your eyes
Thousand voices howling in my head
Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face

Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away
Hey, hey, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
And stay
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands

If I could paint the sky
All the stars would shine on bloody red
Stay
Hey, hey, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
And stay
Hey, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
And stay
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah (I'm hearing voices in the heart of my mind)
And stay
Hey, hey, ah
Hey, hey, ah
Away, hey, ah (I'm hearing voices in the heart of my mind)
Black out days
I don't recognize you anymore
