Song Name: Wizard
I like too many people
'Cause what if none of them like me back
I set myself up and
Let myself down one too many times
One too many
One too many times
If I could get my thoughts right
Then maybe I'd talk better to you
I always think that
Yet again the worst has come for me
(The worst has come for me)
I could send these sights I see to
Somerton and wash it all away
I don't wanna go NLM again
I don't wanna go NLM again
I could send these sights I see to
Somerton and wash it all away
I don't wanna go NLM again
I don't wanna go NLM again
Quivering and shaking as I
Melt into the floorboards as you speak
My tongue is pressed against the roof of my mouth as hard as I can
I can't feel the muscles in my skin no touching
Got a couple days of building up before I gotta run it off on
And everybody in my sight like
Tetsuo gon' never put up without a fight like, like
I could send these sights I see to
Somerton and wash it all away
I don't wanna go NLM again
I don't wanna go NLM again
I could send these sights I see to
Somerton and wash it all away
I don't wanna go NLM again
I don't wanna go NLM again
I'll lift you up
From your eternal life of slumber
I can be your lover
I'll lift you up
From your eternal life of slumber
I can be lover
I can be your lover
I can be your lover
I can be your lover
I can be your lover
