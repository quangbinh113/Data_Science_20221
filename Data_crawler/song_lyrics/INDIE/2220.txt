Song Name: James
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna talk about the things you used to
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna talk about the things you used to
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Oh-oh
Heartbreak lover
I fade into you
Don't let me inside
Change your colours
I wanna see through you
And everything you hide
So meet me when you're high
Yeah, you'll meet me in the light
I don't know when you're ready
I'll do it now when you're ready

I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna talk about the things you used to
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Oh-oh
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna talk about the things you used to
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Oh-oh
Deep, dark heaven
You slowly fade
Tear me up inside
So draw my sorrow
Left, right, yeah, I want you
So meet me when you're high
Yeah, you'll meet me in the light
I don't know when you're ready
I'll do it now when you're ready
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna talk about the things you used to
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Oh-oh
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Oh-oh
