Song Name: Sunny day
Know it's been raining, I swear, I'm not lonely
Always complaining that you never see me
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay (when it's a sunny day)
I'll keep you posted, I promise I'm better
With the sun, we'll leave my house, I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it, I promise I'm better
With the sun, we'll leave my house, I'm sorry for yesterday
Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend
Don't know why I feel this way, treating all my friends the same
Haven't had enough to do, but I'm not ignoring you
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay (when it's a sunny day)
I'll keep you posted, I promise I'm better
With the sun, we'll leave my house, I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it, I promise I'm better
With the sun, we'll leave my house, I'm sorry for yesterday
Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend
