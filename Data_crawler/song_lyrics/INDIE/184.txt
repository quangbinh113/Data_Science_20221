Song Name: I Don't Love You
I can't help I'm selfish
I've met the gun, I've felt the rounds
So now I can put the bullets out
Sharp around the edges
Maybe I'm my father's son
That's why I can't love no one
All the right things still feel wrong
Still feel wrong
Still feel wrong
You need someone I can't become
I'm not the one
I don't love you
I don't love you
And you should be thankful that I don't love you

I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love you
You can't stay and fix this
You won't know where to start
I've got too many broken parts
Blame it on my physics
Maybe it's my father's fault
I stop myself before I fall
All the right things still feel wrong
Still feel wrong
Still feel wrong
You need someone I can't become
I'm not the one
I don't love you
I don't love you
And you should be thankful that I don't love you

I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love you
Darling, I'm sorry
Please don't take this hard 'cause you're a diamond shining
Don't stay in my dark
I'm begging darling, darling
Please don't take this hard
Please don't take this hard
But I don't love you
I don't love you
And you should be thankful that I don't love you
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
