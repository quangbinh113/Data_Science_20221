Song Name: I Need Love
I left my conscience like a crying child
Locked the door behind me put the pain on file
Broken like a window i see my blindness now
I need love
Not some sentimental prison
I need god
Not the political church
I need fire
To melt the frozen sea inside me
I need love
Driving into town tired and depressed
Like a flare the streetlight bursts into an s.o.s.
Peace comes to my rescue i don't know what it means
I need love
