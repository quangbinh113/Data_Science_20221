Song Name: Pool
Sami, Sami, Sam-Soumi
Samia helwe w mahdoumi
Allah ykhalele yaki
Enti rouhi w uyouni
Sitto bethebek kteer
W enti bitsheeli humoomi
Sami, Sami, Sam-Soumi
Samia helwe w mahdoumi
I said, "Lovin' you is bigger than my head"
And then you dove in
And then I said, "I'm afraid that I need men"
You said, "Need me then"
If you are already scared with your mouth up in the air
Then try to breathe under the water through this tube
How long do you think we can sit here before we have to move?
We don't talk much in the morning
Or beginning when you've just arrived
I find that I've forgotten why I did it
And I know your middle name
But I might know you if I didn't
In the moments when you're kissing
Like a baby in the kitchen
How long?
How long?
How long (do I have left with my dog 'til I start forgetting shit?)
How long ('til we're rich, and then we're not, and then we're rich?)
How much longer 'til I'm taller?
How much longer 'til it's midnight?
How much longer 'til the mornin'?
Are my legs gonna last?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
