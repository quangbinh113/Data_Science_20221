Song Name: So My Darling - Acoustic
Remember I'll always love you, you
And I l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love you
And I l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love you
Marcus, I hope that our memories stay
And just know that whatever you do
I hope you love me too
And my heart beats
Stuck in a daze over our thoughts
And watching me grow to be new
I hope you love me too
So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days
So my darling, so my darling
My baby, my boo
You are my best friend
You are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
You
And I l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love you
And I l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love you
Remember the first day we met, it was you
Talking to miss and I came and saved you
Then our friendship just suddenly grew
Started talking and then it all blew
Then we went on our separate ways
Felt really empty and everything changed
We reunited it felt just the same
Now we love in a different way
So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days
And so my darling, so my darling
Baby, my boo
You are my best friend
You are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
Remember I'll always love you
(Always love you)
And I l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love you
So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days
So my darling, so my darling
My baby, my boo
You are my best friend
You are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
