Song Name: The Few Things (With Charlotte Lawrence)
I don't say whats on my mind quite as much as you'd like me to
I've been hearing that my whole life, I promise, it's not just you
But I so confidently want you
That when you say you're insecure about my feelings I
Don't take it serious
But if you need me to tell you more
You're one of the few things that I'm sure of
You're one of the few things that I know already
I could build my world of
One of the few things that I'm sure of
And I want you to unravel me
Come closer, come closer
And I want you to unravel me
I don't say what's on my mind quite as much as you'd like me to
And often when I'm quiet you worry I'm hiding from you
And I know I keep a lot to myself
But still you're more part of me than anybody else
So if you need me to tell you more
You're one of the few things that I'm sure of
You're one of the few things that I know already
I could build my world of
One of the few things that I'm sure of
And I want you to unravel me
Come closer, come closer
And I want you to unravel me
Come closer, come closer
And I want you to unravel me
Come closer, come closer
You're one of the few things that I'm sure of
You're one of the few things that I know already
I could build my world of
One of the few things I'm sure of
And I want you to unravel me
And I want you to unravel me
(Come closer, come closer)
You're one of the few things that I'm sure of

You're one of the few things that I know already
I could build my world of
One of the few things I'm sure of
And I want you to unravel me
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
