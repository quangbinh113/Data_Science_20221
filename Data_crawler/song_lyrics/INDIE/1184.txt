Song Name: Good Stuff
Take it back to the start
No, I can't tell you apart
When we lost one another
That's when I rediscovered
All memories in the clouds
Put my feet on the ground
'Cause I know I should forget you
Oh, why can't I just regret you?
We were fightin' fires every night
When you met me
And it's not fair at all
So after everything
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe?
And forget about the mess we made
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a cryin' shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you
Oh, I try to rewind
Every scene in my mind
And for you I've got tunnel vision
And I've blocked out every collision
And in another life, yeah
Do me a favour and try
To leave me broken and bitter
So movin' on's a little quicker
We were fightin' fires every night
When you met me
And it's not fair at all
So after everything
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe?
And forget about the mess we've made
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a cryin' shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you
Let me ask you why?
I wonder if you're goin' through the same
As I, tonight
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff babe?
And forget about the mess we've made
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe?
And forget about the mess we've made
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a cryin' shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you
When I don't hate you
