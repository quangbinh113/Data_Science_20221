Song Name: Spitting Off the Edge of the World
Cowards, here's the sun
So bow your heads
In the absence of bombs
Draw your breath
Dark, dark places shall be none
She's melting houses of gold
(And the kids cry out)
We're spitting off the edge of the world (out in the night)
Never had no chance (nowhere to hide)
Spitting off the edge of the world (out comes the sun)
Never had no chance (nowhere to run)
Mama, what have you done?
I trace your steps
In the darkness of one
Am I what's left?
Silver lines whisper to me
"Wounded arms must carry the load"
(And the kids cry out)
We're spitting off the edge of the world (out in the night)
Never had no chance (nowhere to hide)
We're spitting off the edge of the world (nowhere to run)
Never had no chance (out comes the sun)
Spitting off the edge of the world
Winds from the sky (never had no chance)
Will watch us rise
