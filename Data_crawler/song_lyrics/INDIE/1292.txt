Song Name: Seventeen
I know what you wanna say
I think that you're all the same

Constantly being led astray

He's thinking of something you don't
Downtown harks back
Halfway up the street
I used to be free
I used to be seventeen
Follow my shadow
Around your corner
I used to be seventeen
Now you're just like me
Down beneath the ashes and the stone
Sure of what I've lived and have known

I see you so uncomfortably alone
I wish I could show you how much you've grown
Downtown harks back
I used to be on this street
I used to be seventeen
I used to be seventeen
Now you're half shy
Hanging on my block
Sun coming up
Who's my shadow?
I know what you're gonna be

I know that you're gonna be
You're crumbling up just to see
Afraid that you'll be just like me

Downtown harks back
Halfway through this life
I used to feel free
Was it just a dream?
Now you're half shy
Think you're so carefree
But you're just seventeen
So much like me
You're just seventeen
You're just seventeen
Seventeen
