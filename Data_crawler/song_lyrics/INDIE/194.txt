Song Name: 2 / 14
Second guess these words of mine
I always thought that I'd be fine with you
But ever since we crossed that line
Got your green eyes in the back of my mind, it's true
But I can't be just friends
You're messing with my head
And I know what I said
But, these feelings they keep runnin' the red
I got your heart on my mind
And you said, that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got, your face on my mind and
It was fun, runnin' around for awhile
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
Two steps forward, one step back and
It won't be long for my heart attack, nope
And common sense falls second place
To the way it feels when you kiss my face, nope
But I can't be just friends
You're messing with my head
And I know what I said
But, these feelings they keep runnin' the red
I got your heart on my mind
And you said, that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got, your face on my mind and
It was fun, runnin' around for awhile
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
Oh, I can't fall in love tonight
Can't fall in love, yup!
