Song Name: i miss you
It was the last time you called
That was the last time I cried
I should've known better but I
Wouldn't even know if I tried
You and me we felt complete
You and me we felt like the way things should be
But we weren't
No, we weren't
But I miss you
No matter how much I try
To forget you
I just can't seem to say goodbye
'Cause I miss you
No matter how much it hurts
I still want you
For better or for worse
For better or for worse

For better or for worse
But I know you and me
We weren't meant to be
I should go and move on but you're stuck on me
Like sticky, sticky chewing gum

I promised myself
That I wouldn't love again
But then you walked into my life
And now I can't pretend
That I don't miss you
No matter how much I try
To forget you
I just can't seem to say goodbye
'Cause I miss you
No matter how much it hurts
I still want you
For better or for worse
For better or for worse
For better or for worse
Oooh
For better or for worse
For better or for worse
