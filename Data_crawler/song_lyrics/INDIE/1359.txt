Song Name: fleabag
Oh, I, I'm scared, I'm gonna die alone
My feminism only goes so far on me
Chill at the bar, tell you that you're funny
Laugh at all your jokes, roll my eyes when you're not looking
Guess one more drink won't kill anybody
But on the long drive to your house
Oh, I forget myself
You're the one, I have a hard time
I'm just sad, then fine, oh
God, forgive me for the things I've done
God, forgive me for the things I've done
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Oh, I just make myself so miserable
It's not my fault, my heart's so cynical on me
Chill at the bar, let you tell me stories
How much you love your mom? and how you make your money?
Guess one more drink won't kill anybody
But on the long drive to your house
Oh, I forget myself
You're the one, I have a hard time
I'm just sad, then fine, oh
God, forgive me for the things I've done
God, forgive me for the things I've done
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
But on the long drive to your house
Oh, I forget myself
You're the one, I have a hard time
I'm just sad, then fine, oh
God, forgive me for the things I've done
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Will God forgive me for the things I've done, I've done?
Forgive me for the things I've done (won't kill anybody)
Will God forgive me for the things I've done?
Will God forgive me for the things I've done? (Won't kill anybody)
Will God forgive me for the things I've done, oh? (Won't kill anybody)
The things I've done
The things I've done
