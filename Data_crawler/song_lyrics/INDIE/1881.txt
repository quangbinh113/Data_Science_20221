Song Name: Desire
Sorry
I didn't ask if I could leave your arms
I'm sorry
I didn't know that it would be so long
It's been awhile, she said, since I've know what was in your head
Worry
It doesn't matter if I sleep at night
Don't worry
You know that nothings going to be alright
It's been a crying shame, I don't know if I'll see you again
Fire
Oh the fire burns out so fast
Desire
There's no desire that would ever last
So I'll run away and I'll leave you to die in the flames
