Song Name: ALLTHETIME
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time...)
I've been dreaming about you lately
Despite my insomnia
Cause I've been missing you baby
And I...
I wanna let you know
That...
You are the reason I keep on leaving
You're all I've got
And ...
You are the reason I get up in the morning
And I wanna to let you know
That when I'm alone
I think about you all the...
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
You're always on my mind
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
You're on my mind
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
When you get home, will you call me?
(Will you call me when you're home?)
To let me know you're safe
It's getting dark out, maybe you should head back
(Maybe you should head back home)
Unless you'd rather stay
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
You're always on my mind
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Time (all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
You're on my mind
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
