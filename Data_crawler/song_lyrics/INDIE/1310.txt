Song Name: Your Dog
I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold
I don't wanna be your little pet
At the edge of every bed
You sleep in body stretching out
Guess I'll curl up on the couch
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees in
Leave me crawling back to you
'Cause I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees in
Leave me crawling back to you
'Cause I don't wanna be your baby girl
That you show off to the world
When do you decide you want to feel
Like you limit something real
I'm not a prop for you to use
When you're lonely or confused
I want a love that lets me breathe
I've been choking on your leash
