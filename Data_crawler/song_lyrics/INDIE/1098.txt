Song Name: Desperado
Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Take it easy, I'm not tryna go against you
Actually, I'm going with you
Gotta get up out of here and you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't 'cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, just want out of here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain't no goin' back
If you want we could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothin', there ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone
Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broke up
Take it easy, I'm not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf with ya
Gotta get up out of here and you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't 'cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want out of here, yeah
Once we're gone, ain't no goin' back
If you want, we could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothin', there ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
I don't wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone
If you want, we could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothin', there ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone
If you want, we could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothin', there ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
