Song Name: Lilith
Comfortable enough to think you'll take her
But when she smiles, all her teeth are made of razors
She doesn't care about your words
Or how you'll save her
Where she comes from, there's no saviors
Worry 'bout what you got yourself into
She doesn't like it when you tell her that she's sinful
You better watch your back
'Cause she can see right through you
Knows exactly how she'll kill you
Face like an angel
But she's far from that
She makes up her own rules
She never looks back
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
Make you cry, no point in hiding
She loves the sight, fear in your eyes
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
Cloudy skies, she doesn't mind
She's from the fires, plan your demise
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
Don't even try, you'll never understand her
Waste of your time tryna decipher her demeanor
Losin' your mind, she'll never follow your commands, her
Heart is frozen, full of anger
Face like an angel
But she's far from that
She makes up her own rules
She never looks back
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
Make you cry, no point in hiding
She loves the sight, fear in your eyes
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
Cloudy skies, she doesn't mind
She's from the fires, plan your demise
She does as she pleases (Ahh, ahh)
She knows that you need it (Ahh, ahh)
