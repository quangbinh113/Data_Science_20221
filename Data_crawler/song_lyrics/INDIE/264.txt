Song Name: American Boyfriend
Simple girl, I ended up on your dad's doorstep
(She was a simple girl)
Suddenly, my body fell into yours
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend

No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend
I wanna die on sunset (I wanna die, I wanna die)
(He was a pop star with a bounty on his head)
My parents wanna kill me, let them kill me
I'll finally be on TV
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
(Say it again now, say it again now, yeah)
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend

No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend

Burn bridges, American Boyfriend
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend
I found my way
You're my American boy
