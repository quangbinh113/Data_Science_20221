Song Name: heart attack
I thought of letting her out
She's a big, brave girl now, I can't relate
I feel like a horse or a shark, I could sleep standing up
In the daytime, I'm falling awake
I picture a cat who looks like Juno on the fence
It gives me a heart attack, I can't lose another friend
I'm measuring up against the wall again
It's always the same, but maybe this time, I've changed
Crosswalk, go now
Green light, forever counting down
Check first, left, right
Black out, must've run out of time
I've thought of letting it go
Create a record-breaking ball of snow
Too big to catch it, but I could if I
Had just reached out like half a year ago
Everybody's screaming, waving, fainting in the pit
Just give me a heart attack, I'm fucking losing it
I'm measuring up against the wall again
It's always the same, but maybe this time, I've changed
I'm measuring up against the wall again
It's always the same, but maybe this time, I've changed
Gasping for air like there's a lack of oxygen
You'll all have to drag me back, I can't do this again
