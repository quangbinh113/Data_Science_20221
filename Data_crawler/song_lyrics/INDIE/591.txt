Song Name: mars
She was only 17
Had the saddest pair of eyes that you've ever seen
Wore them lips and a coat that was matching green
But she can't be herself when she's somebody else
In the morning, she would take her mother's wedding ring
But school got pretty tough when they see it gleam
So she hid herself under the mezzanine
Reenacting scenes, yeah
She dreamed she'd go to California
There everyone would adore her
And all her mates will call her
'Til four in the morning
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah
Every morning, she would wake up with another plan
Yeah, her mum and dad, they couldn't understand
Why she couldn't turn it off, become a better man
All this therapy eats away gently
At the side of her mind that she never had
Yeah, this story told too many times, it makes me sad
I bet her author made a fortune out the autograph
Give her her money back, 'cause
She dreamed she'd go to California
There everyone would adore her
And all her mates will call her
'Til four in the morning
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah
Do you feel like you're irrelevant?
Do you feel like you're irrelevant?
Do you feel like you're just scared as fuck?
Do you feel like you're irrelevant?
Do you feel like you're irrelevant?
Do you feel like you're just scared as fuck?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
