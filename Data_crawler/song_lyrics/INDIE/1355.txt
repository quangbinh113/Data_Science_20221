Song Name: Glimpse of Us
She'd take the world off my shoulders if it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in the blue
Why then if she's so perfect, do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working, so what can I do? (Ooh)
When you're out of sight in my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory, does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again
When you're out of sight in my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
