Song Name: Like or Like Like
I watched you through your window
I was wearing that dumb sweatshirt
I looked like a goon
I was dressed for winter
Even though it was the middle of June
I watched you get undressed
I must have turned bright red
'Cause I couldn't stand to face you
'Cause I liked what I saw
And maybe we should just stay friends
Tell me how you feel about me
Do you like or like, like me?
Tell me what you really feel
Do you like me? Just say you do
I climbed up your front porch
And I doorbell ditched you
And I felt so bad
Couldn't cop to what I did
So I laughed myself sick all the way to my car

Tell me how you feel about me
Do you like or like, like me?
Tell me what you really feel
Do you like me? Just say you do
Tell me how you feel about me
Do you like or like, like me?
Tell me what you really feel
Do you like me? Just say you do
