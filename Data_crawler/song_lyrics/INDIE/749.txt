Song Name: Anything You Want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You want my love, but I don't give a fuck
You call my bluff, how can I keep this up?
I've had enough, you know I like it rough
Bite my neck and suck my butt
Biding my time with such and such
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
She's got my love, no, she can't get enough
I like it rough
But I said that twice, fuck
Her kiss is tough, she speaks and fists her cuffs
Say my name soon as she walk up
Say my name when I beat that up
(Ow!)
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
You got the funk
Gets me stupid, gets me drunk
I'll do anything that you want
Anything that you want, want, want
(Anything that you want, yeah, anything that you want)
(Yeah, anything that you want, yeah yeah yeah...)
(Anything that you want)
