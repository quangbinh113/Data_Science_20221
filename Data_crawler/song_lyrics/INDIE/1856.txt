Song Name: Superstar
Oh, to be happy
Oh, to be white
When everything's easy
Why do I put up a fight?
I can be a superstar
Whatever your like
I can get better
I'll do it in time
In time to save you
In time to praise you
In time to love you
To think the whole world of you
In time to embrace you
In time to just swallow
In time I'll suck it up
So that you can wallow
So that you can be alone
So that you can be alone
So that you can be alone
I can make you better
I can make you a good person
Oh, to be evil
Oh, to be bad to myself
Oh, it's so, so easy
So easy to self-destruct
I can get better
I can be more than enough
In time to save you
In time to praise you
In time to love you
To think the whole world of you
In time to embrace you
In time to just swallow
In time I'll suck it up
So that you can wallow
So that you can be alone
So that you can be alone
So that you can be alone
