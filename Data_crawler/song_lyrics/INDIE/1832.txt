Song Name: Choking on Flowers
Inside your house
Weve got a lot to talk about
Decorations that we found
Instead we look around
Instead we look around
I dont mind
It happens all the time
Dont decide
It happens all the time
Inside your car
We never have to drive too far
I like the freckles on your arm
Not eat with you id rather starve
Inside your house
Your mom puts on her favorite blouse
We pass the dishes all around
I hope they like me now
I hope they like me now
You remind me of better times
Dusty blinds
This happens all the time
