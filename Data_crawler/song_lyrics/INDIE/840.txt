Song Name: Friends Don't Keep Secrets
Yeah, it was hot in the city for the first time in months
And gosh, you looked pretty with sweat dripping from your clothes
And we biked down the streets of Manhattan
Playing M83, it was so cinematic
So what if I haven't mentioned
The whole truth about my feelings?
Sometimes, they're just better left alone
Well, friends don't keep secrets (friends don't keep secrets)
But would you even believe me
If I told you I've been in love with you since seventeen?
Oh, and I'm sorry (I'm sorry) that I never told you (I never told you)
I'm just so in love with something we could never be (friends can't keep)
But now, you got a boyfriend and you look real happy
Well, is it so bad to dream about what really would've happened?
Well, friends don't keep secrets
But would you even believe me
If I told you I've been in love with you since seventeen?
Oh, and I'm sorry (I'm sorry) that I never told you
I'm just so in love with something we could never be (because friends can't keep)
