Song Name: Born To Survive
Never thought I'd
Have to say this but
If we don't hold out
Till tomorrow
It's gonna be our faces
That they'll remember if
Iit all goes
Crashing, burning down
Crying out till there's
Nothing left
I forget myself
Facing it one day
At a time
Follow me till the
Next sunrise
Might make it out of
Here alive
'Cause you and I were
Born to survive
Can take anything on
Side by side
I wanna see the next sunrise
Hang tight for one
More god damn night
'Cause you and I were born to survive
(I forget myself)
Never wanna see you
Slow down 'cause
You know too many
Eyes are watching
We've come too
Far to go now
Stay alive, no other options
We're falling to the ground
Crying out till there's
Nothing left
(I forget myself
I forget myself)
I forget myself
Take anything on side by side
I wanna see the next sunrise
Hang tight for one
More god damn night
'Cause you and I
Were born to survive
