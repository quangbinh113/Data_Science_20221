Song Name: Hug All Ur Friends
What's it like to be alone on a Sunday
Remembering the time you saw them just yesterday?
Sing me a song, tell me your thoughts
I could listen to you all night long
And I don't care about my sleeping routine
I fucked it up as it is, but we've got so much time to kill
As the night rocks me to sleep

Remember when we felt like animations
And didn't need A grades for self-validation?
Tell me about the things that you love
The world simply needs more affection 'cause
I don't care about what people think of me
I'm fucked up as it is, but we've got so much time to kill
And so many things to see
Life's too short
To worry about things that we got wrong
So hug all your friends and let them know
You're not letting go
No, I won't let go, oh
Oh, oh-ooh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Did you and your friends have fun on the weekend?
Nothing feels better than sleeping and sleeping in
Watch as my head falls away from the room
I would hug all my friends if they weren't friends with you
You don't know what it's like to be nothing at all
When the night turns cold my thoughts feel like stone
And it's nothing I can't change
But I can't breathe anymore
I forgot how to walk by myself
I could do with a little more of your help
Life's too short
To worry about things we got wrong
So hug all your friends and let them know
You're not letting go
I'm not letting go
Life's too short
To worry about things that we got wrong
So hug all your friends and let them know
You're not letting go
I'm not letting go
So hug all your friends and let them know
You're not letting go
No, I won't let go
