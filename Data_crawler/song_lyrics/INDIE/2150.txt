Song Name: Wild
I was reminded every measure
Of riding trade winds
Buried treasure
I got on fine with modern living
But must I be such a citizen
And the world still so wild called to me
I was lost, I'd been kept on my knees
Trippers and askers
They surrounded me
All them describing
How they'd like me
All them wanting
Something special
Bring 'em roses
Sing them blues
And the world still so wild called to me
I'd been caught, I was lost on my knees
I looked full over all the lies and
Appealing to me advertising
And I was living tight every night
And the world still so wild called to me
I was lost I'd been kept on my knees
And the world still so wild called to me
