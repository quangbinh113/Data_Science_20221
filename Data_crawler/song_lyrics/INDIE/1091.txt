Song Name: Avocado Toast
Life goes so fast
I've been living so slow
Let's just leave
Do whatever we want to
I don't want no regret
No rainy days
Let's head out west
Try to live tomorrows
Wake up with a beer
On the pacific coast
I don't want no regret
No rainy days
Life goes so fast
I've been living so slow
Holding onto my past
I just wanna let go
I don't want no regret
No rainy days
When we're out west
We'll only drink french roast
Heirloom tomatoes
On avocado toast
I don't want no regret
No rainy days
Life goes so fast
I've been living so slow
Let's just leave
Do whatever we want to
I don't want no
I don't want no regret
No rainy days
