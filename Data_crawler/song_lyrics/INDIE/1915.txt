Song Name: Arp-87
You look like you've lost your mind
And your idea of love don't fit mine
We'll decay in time
Alone every night, love hurts
She said don't trip
It's cool, I'm over it
Haircut, new fit
She's cruel, get over it
Want you back, I don't care
Want you back, I won't stare
We'll decay in time
Alone every night, love hurts
She said don't trip
It's cool, I'm over it
Haircut, new fit
She's cruel, get over it
Yeah, hit me again
Yeah, hit me again
She said don't trip
It's cool, I'm over it
Haircut, new fit
She's cruel, get over it
In the bathroom, kissing my best friend
