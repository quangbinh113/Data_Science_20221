Song Name: Oysters In My Pocket
Oysters in the pocket
We're saving for lunch
Not that we are selfish
We just haven't learnt much
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
Let's go, go
Couldn't take the folly out
The peddles too much
Send me on my bicycle
The chain is all rust
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
Paying off the limousine now, we're in no rush
Tried to give my number away
But I haven't heard much
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
Oysters in the pocket
We're saving for lunch
They say that you waste away
But we're having more fun
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
Oh well, that's miles away
