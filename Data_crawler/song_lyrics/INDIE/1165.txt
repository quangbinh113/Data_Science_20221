Song Name: Friend
Pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
Just thought you should know, I never wanted closure
But you had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?
I'm sure you're doin' fine, but I don't wanna hear it
And if I left my t-shirt, you can keep it
I don't wanna see you again if it's different
'Cause I'll only see all the things that I'm missin'
And I should've cut all the ties, but I didn't
I didn't let go, mmh-mmh-mmh
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit (Killing me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be-
You had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit (Killing me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
So funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?
