Song Name: Lost in You
I'm not tryna complicate none of this
None of this, so
Lemme just, lemme just, lemme just
Come tell you how I feel
Okay, uhm
I'm just lookin' for some balance and some trust
I'm just lookin' for some mutual love
But all I get is unrequited
Why my world always on fire, never chilly?
I used to hate the serious, I used to be so silly
But I'm not a kid no more
No, I'm not a kid
But I guess that's what we always said
Yeah, I guess that's what we always said, hey
And we can get lost in an off-beat rhythm
Feel the way that you're movin'
And I think that I get it
And I think that I will
'Til the sun come up
When the sun go down
We gon' get in touch
'Cause I don't even know
I don't know why
All your love I'm tryna find
I'm so lost in you
And all that you do, hey
And here we go, I
Never really know why
I'm just tryna take it slow
See where it goes
'Cause you know, that you'll never really know
Even though I can feel it in my soul
But you never know why
And here we go, I
Never really know why
I can't let it go
But you give me so much hope
So I gotta keep you close
Yeah, you're givin' the most
And I never know
No, I never know why
All the silly things we hide
Just to keep our peace of mind
No, I never know
No, I never know
No, I never know why
