Song Name: Strawberry
My love
I think about you when you're not around
내 사랑
너 하나만을 품고 있나봐
As corny as it may all sound
I've got to say it out aloud
You make me happier than anything
My baby
Don't leave me waiting up all night
I'll keep the candlelight alight
I would do anything for you my love
My precious love
My love
I think about you when you're not around
내 사랑
너 하나만을 품고 있나봐
Sweet old-fashioned love
Precious in my heart
Sweet old-fashioned love
Precious in my heart
My love
I think about you when you're not around
내 사랑
너 하나만을 품고 있나봐
Looking into your eyes
I can see big smiles around
Old-fashioned it sounds
But I would be sad without you around
Sweet old-fashioned love
Precious in my heart
Sweet old-fashioned love
Precious in my heart
