Song Name: Waves
Eyes wide
When i was telling you that i had it all
But i was really just falling on the ground
High line
Lost in the moment my words are outspoken
I'm starting to open
I'm starting to open yeah
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm falling back for you
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm falling back
Eyes wide
Oh and i'm losing my rest and breath and my head
I think i lost my head for awhile now
I feel like a child now
Cuz i'm getting older
My minds getting colder yeah
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm falling back for you
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm counting backwards
I'm falling back
I'm falling back
