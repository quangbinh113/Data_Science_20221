Song Name: The Cigarette Duet
It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad
Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?
It's just a cigarette like you always used to do
I was different then, I don't need them to be cool
It's just a cigarette and it harms your pretty lungs
Well, it's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance
It's just a cigarette, it'll soon be only ten
Honey, can't you trust me? When I want to stop, I can
It's just a cigarette and it's just a Marlboro Light
Maybe, but is it worth it if we fight?
It's just a cigarette that I got from Jamie-Lee
Oh, she's gonna get a smack and I'm gonna give you three
It's just a cigarette and I only did it once (it's just a cigarette, it'll soon be only ten)
It's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance (it'll make you sick girl there's not much of a chance)
It's just a cigarette and I'm sorry that I did it (it's just a cigarette, you'll be sorry that you did it)
Honey, can't you trust me? When I want to stop, I can

La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
