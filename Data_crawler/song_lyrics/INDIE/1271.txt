Song Name: When I'm Small
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Lucy's underground, she's got a mouth to feed
Am I underground or am I in between?
Lucy's underground, she's got a mouth to feed

Am I underground or am I in too deep?
Show me love
You've got your hand on the button now
Sure enough
You've got your hand on the button now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Lucy's underground, she's never coming back
Am I still alive or has the light gone black?
Take me underground, take me all the way

Bring me to the fire, throw me in the flame
So, show me love
You've got your hands on the button now
Sure enough
You've got your hand on the button now
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
Than to be with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, (than to be with you) ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, (I'd rather die) ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, (I'd rather die) ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, (I'd rather die) ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, (I'd rather die) ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
