Song Name: Heavy Days
You're thinking it's
Been a while
These heavy days are all so tired
I'm on my way
You got nothing to say
But your eyes are telling me to stay
Your eyes
Shimmer in silver ways
Your eyes
Your eyes telling me to stay
Instrumental
The news is grim
It's always the same
Gotta turn it off to stay sane
I'm on my way
You got nothing to say
But your eyes are telling me to stay
Your eyes
Shimmer in silver ways
Your eyes
Your eyes telling me to stay
Instrumental
(Your eyes) Gotta turn it off to stay sane
(Your eyes) Gotta turn it off to stay sane
(Your eyes) Gotta turn it off to stay sane
(Your eyes) Gotta turn it off to stay sane
Instrumental
