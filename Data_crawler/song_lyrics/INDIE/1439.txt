Song Name: Sugar
I ran out of made up consolations
I've been waiting forever
How can you call me with such conviction?
Sugar cane, sugar
You get yourself out of situations
Won't you leave me, won't you?
'Cause I don't have the time for indignations
Sugar cane, sugar
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
Can you find just one thing you cherish?
Would you hold me just like you mean it?
Am I the one with much imagination?
Give me one reason
As it gets older
You keep pullin' and pushin' away
But you never promised me
To be wiser or better
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

Sugar
My sugar cane
Sugar
Sugar
