Song Name: Her Sinking Sun
Torn apart from everyone
The sinking sun
I watched her die
Took a sick day to bleed
Inside something
Not meant to be
You were so convincing
And so heaven white
I watch you die
Animals begging to eat
They can't survive
Not meant to be
Flowers of skin and bone
We're all alone
Waiting to die
Take me from this evil place
In your twisting arms
Not meant to be
Water rushes through my heart
It's torn apart
By your trusting mind
Sickening bodies tied
To easy lines
Not meant to be
