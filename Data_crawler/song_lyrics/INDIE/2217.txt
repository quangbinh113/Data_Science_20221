Song Name: summer bruises
Spent my time agonizing over you
A coping mechanism I am sticking to
And I remember the first time that I saw you
I think it was a rainy day
You took my hand and I began to cry
You said I got a lot to learn
You are never coming back and I know it
I'm just thinking 'bout the past 'cause I miss you a lot
These days
Spent my time just picking at the wound
Imagining the kind of people you might choose
And I don't really wanna talk about it
I'd much rather forget about it
And pretend it never happened
You are never coming back and I know it
I'm just thinking 'bout the past 'cause I miss you a lot
These days
Used to have fun now I got the summer bruises
Now that you're gone I got the summer bruises baby
