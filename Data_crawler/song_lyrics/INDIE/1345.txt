Song Name: heaven
Is there a heaven?
I'd like to believe
That I'm just a passenger in the backseat
Is there a heaven?
Some place we find peace?
I hope that you're there saving my seat
Ghost in my head
I feel when you tread softly
You went ahead
Now you know the end
When I close my eyes
And picture my death
I don't see stars, I just see the end
I know that it's wrong
I want more for you
When you talk to God, do you like the view?
Ghost in my head
I feel when you tread softly
You went ahead
Now you know the end
