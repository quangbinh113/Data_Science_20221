Song Name: Daydreaming
Baby, I've given up making sense now
Words are just sounds, lost in the curl of your ear
Baby, something's unravelling in me
And I know the world wakes up outside, but in here
We'll be daydreaming (we'll be daydreaming)
Oh, wherever I go
You're the wind blowing through my mind
Whatever I cared about before this
Don't mean a thing to me now
It don't mean a thing
Baby, I wanna stay in slow motion
We were so lucky, and here I am holding you tight
And I don't wanna rush a thing
Oh, baby, whatever regrets I bring with me
I will come home, and you will love me anyway
We'll be daydreaming (we'll be daydreaming)
Oh, wherever I go
You're the wind blowing through my mind
Whatever I cared about before this
Don't mean a thing to me now
It don't mean a thing
A thing, it don't mean a thing
This is a year I know I won't forget
But when I look back
I won't remember a thing, not a thing that we did
But I'll know we had a good time
Oh, wherever I go
You're the wind blowing through my mind
Whatever I cared about before this
Don't mean a thing to me now
Oh, wherever I go
You're the wind blowing through my mind
Whatever I cared about before this
Don't mean a thing to me now
A thing
A thing
Oh, a thing
