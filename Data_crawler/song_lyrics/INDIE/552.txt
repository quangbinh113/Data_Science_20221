Song Name: Bubble Pop Electric
Come on, Johnny, when you gonna get here?
(Alright, hold your pretty horses) (I'll be there in a minute)
(You just get yourself dolled up, alright, Toots?)
(And you pick a place, you just pick a place)
Um, Johnny (Yeah, Gwenny-Gwen-Gwen?)
You might want to hurry, because tonight is the night
I'm empty, I need fulfilling, yes, I do love
To the ceiling, when I do love
I get this feeling when I'm in love
I'm restless, can't you see I try my bestest
To be good girl? because it's just us
So take me now and do me justice
I'm waiting patiently, anticipating your arrival
And I'm hating, it takes so long to get to my house
To take me out
(Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric
(Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, uh-oh (in the back seat)
OK, now, I understand he's on his way now
But Jeez Louise, I mean today now
I can't wait, I wanna play now (oo)
I'm antsy, bubble pop electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it's randy
I'm itchy, I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me?
Swoop on by, so you can snatch me and take me out
(Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric
(Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, uh-oh (in the back seat)
I'll get it (need to be satisfied)
Hey, Johnny (Come pick me up, I want to ride)
Let me go grab my sweater
(Hi, Mr. Stefani) (Hurry, hurry, come to me)
Bye, Mom
(So, baby, where you wanna go, huh?)
(Drive-in movie)
(Drive-in, move me)
(Drive in to me)
Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
(Straight to me, drive in, move me)
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
(Come to me, drive in movie)
Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
(Straight to me, drive in, move me)
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
(Come to me, drive in movie)
(Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric
(Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, uh-oh (in the back seat)
(Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric
(Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the back seat)
Bubble pop electric, uh-oh (in the back seat)
(Yeah, tell your father I said hello)
Johnny, get out of here
