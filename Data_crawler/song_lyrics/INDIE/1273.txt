Song Name: Coffee
True
It's a dance, we know the moves
The bow, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news
Wrap me
In your arms
I can't feel it but
Rock me
In your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing
Wild winters
Warm coffee
Mom's gone
Do you love me?
Blazing summer
Cold coffee
Baby's gone
Do you love me?
Wrap me
In your arms
I can't feel it but
Rock me
In your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
(Wrap me) My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
(Rock me) My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
Get up, get down
(And we'll all run out) Get up
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
