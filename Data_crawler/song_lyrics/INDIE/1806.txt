Song Name: Let U Go
My baby calls but she never gets ahold of me
She's out the door while I'm sleeping in 'til three (whoa)
But I never wanna let you go, never wanna let you go, never gonna let you go
Why you rushin' out the door?
Baby, where you gotta go?
Won't you stay a little more?
Take what you want (what you want)
Take what you need (what you need)
Told her I don't need nothing
You all I need (you all I need)
I'm on another wave
Smile up on your face
Yeah, that's my baby, that's my lover
That my one and that my only
That my
When I'm feelin' lonely
Way you get up on me
I'm at my safest irreplaceable you are
And now my Saturdays turn to sadder days
When you're not around to hold
My baby calls but she never gets ahold of me (ohh)
She's out the door while I'm sleeping in 'til three (whoa)
But I never wanna let you go, never wanna let you go, never gonna let you go
Why you rushin' out the door?
Baby, where you gotta go?
Won't you stay a little more?
Okay, now, don't call me every minute, that shit annoying
That make me think that you been thinkin' I ain't bein' loyal
Just being honest baby, who gon' love you like this?
She got my soul, and now she wanted was a hug and a kiss
Now, don't be turnin' nothin' into some shit that wasn't
See if you really trust me there wouldn't be no discussions
I know you like to dance around the focal point
I thought you knew me, so let me know if you think you don't
My baby calls but she never gets ahold of me (ohh)
She's out the door while I'm sleeping in 'til three (whoa)
But I never wanna let you go, never wanna let you go, never gonna let you go
Why you rushin' out the door?
Baby, where you gotta go?
Won't you stay a little more?
Now all my ladies (yeah)
And all my dawgs
Let's clap our hands like we don't give a fuck at all
And all my fellas (yeah)
Get off the walls (get off the walls)
Go get your girl and shake that thing until you fall (until you fall, until you fall)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, uh
Shake it, shake it, shake it, oh
But I never wanna let you go
Never wanna let you go
Never gonna let you go (never gonna let you go)
My baby calls but she never gets ahold of me (ohh)
She's out the door while I'm sleeping in 'til three (whoa)
But I never wanna let you go, never wanna let you go, never gonna let you go
Why you rushin' out the door?
Baby, where you gotta go?
Won't you stay a little more?
