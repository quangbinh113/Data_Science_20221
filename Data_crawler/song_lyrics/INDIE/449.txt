Song Name: Overnight Sensation
The sun is falling down outside the city walls
She's glowing like the cherry on my cigarette
Beads of sweat & diamonds dripping down her neck
I cannot take my eyes off her silhouette
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, You really outdid Yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation
You look like you should be a centrefold
But I'm talking Playboy 1974
Sure don't make them like you anymore
I'll breathe between your tan lines forevermore
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, You really outdid Yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation
The sun is rising up outside this balcony
She is blooming like a flower laying next to me
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, You really outdid Yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation
