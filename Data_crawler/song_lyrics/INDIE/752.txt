Song Name: Songs I Can't Listen To
There's a song that I love that you once played for me
It had all the right chords, and a sweet melody
It was back when we started, when there was mystery
Now they've all erased my music machine
And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And do you still sing along when you're all by yourself
Or do you switch to the next one, sing for somebody else
When you're cold don't forget how the song kept us warm
You would dance on my bed, I would lay in your arms
And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record
And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record
And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
