Song Name: grateful
I must confess
I've got regrets
I could have more but I could have less
And the more that I know
The less I think I know
I get stressed out
Yeah, I get overwhelmed
I'm always worrying about my health
But the answer to all the big shit is
Hidden in all the small print
Let's go for a walk
Take a deep breath
All of the flowers are out for you and me, babe
It doesn't have to be painful
I wanna tell you I'm grateful
Let's go for a drive
Hit the seasidе
I swear it only exists just for you and I
Well, if I'm gonna diе
I might as well fucking try
To live my life
My sister moved
To London in the fall
To find whatever she was looking for
Well, she's moving back to the north now
'Cause her friends all fucking adore her
I miss my house
I miss my family home
I still remember that landline phone
Yeah, that number is burnt in my brain
I'll never let it go
Let's go for a walk
Take a deep breath
All of the flowers are out for you and me, babe
It doesn't have to be painful
I wanna tell you I'm grateful
Let's go for a drive
Hit the seasidе
I swear it only exists just for you and I
Well, if I'm gonna diе
I might as well fucking try
To live my life
If I'm gonna die
I might as well fucking try
To live my life
Well, if I'm gonna die
I might as well
