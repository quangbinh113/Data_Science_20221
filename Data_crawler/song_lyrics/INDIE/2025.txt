Song Name: Listerine
I stop but then I hesitate
What's the point of leaving if we can't even wait?
She's thinking of what she could say
15 days that I spent
Finding out what you meant
Now we're dancing again
Keeping time, she keeps my eyes awake
What else is there to say?
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
I thought that this was something different than before
Now we're changing shape inside your brain and starting to reform
Oh, Lord, now I'm speaking words without thinking before
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
I wanted to do what I said that I'd do
Now I'm making things up and not thinking it through
So true, it was so legit but it's nothing new
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
Well, now I don't know what to speak
Writing a verse is worse than you think
I'm spitting out her Listerine
15 days that I spent
Finding out what you meant
Now we're dancing again
Keeping time, she keeps my eyes awake
What else is there to say?
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
I thought that this was something different than before
Now we're changing shape inside your brain and starting to reform
Oh, Lord, now I'm speaking words without thinking before
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
I wanted to do what I said that I'd do
Now I'm making things up and not thinking it through
So true, it was so legit but it's nothing new
(I knew that I wouldn't change)
