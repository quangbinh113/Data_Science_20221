Song Name: House Of Mirrors
Brain dead
Spend all my time sedated
Hey Mom and Dad, I made it
Graduated from the A-list to the basement
Yeah
Who knows? Who cares?
(It hurts to see the truth)
House of mirrors out there
(Reflected back at you)
Vacant
Spend all my time debating
Like a worm when the rain ends
Trying to make it off the pavement
Where the grass is
'Cause everything is greener in my head
I guess that's why I feel so disappointed
And I don't wanna deal with the consequence
Does it matter in the end?
Who knows? Who cares?
(It hurts to see the truth)
House of mirrors out there
(Reflected back at you)
Who knows? Who cares?
(It hurts to see the truth)
House of mirrors out there
