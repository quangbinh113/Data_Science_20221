Song Name: Olympus
I'd still kill for you
I'd die to spend the night at your belonging
All my friends think that I've lost it
Up at Olympus, miss your house still
Sounds like birds and smells like vodka
You're always off your rocker
I wanna save myself, you're part of my addiction
I just keep you in the kitchen while I burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Can't get through winter
At your house, sweat out the drugs all through the summer
Let my heart sleep in the gutter
Wish I remember when we kissed but now it's faded
'Cause I always just replayed it 'til it left
I wanna save myself, you're part of my addiction
I just keep you in the kitchen while I burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Baby wanna erase this
You're not shameless
I'm afraid of your description that I'm fitting when I'm faded
I'm alone when I live at your house
When I slip I live at your house
Getting the bends and I'm scared of it now
Hate myself 'cause I always black out
I wanna save myself, you're part of my addiction
I just keep you in the kitchen
While I burn
Burn
Burn
While I burn
Burn
Burn
While I burn
Burn
Burn
While I burn
Burn
Burn
