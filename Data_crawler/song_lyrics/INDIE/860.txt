Song Name: Less and Less
We make an end
It seems short-sighted but in all defense
We were pretty damn young and unspent
Making choices with our innocence
And october ends
We grow closer to our other friends
Where I sat beside you I sit now, reflect
And walk by buildings 'till it makes some sense
And I know you should take yourself
Feel the rhythm, life goes on again
Though I ain't sure it's really how we meant
I'll feel settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you less and less
See the grey fruit moon
By the willows where you clutched my youth
I recall the end we always knew
We drift apart but it's the right way through
Yes, I know you should take yourself
Feel the rhythm, life goes on again
Though I ain't sure it's really how we meant
I'll feel settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you less and less
And though it's fading with time
I remember the warm nights with love in your eyes
Passing the days, watching rain as it dries
Staring at your eyes I know it's the time
When you should take yourself
See the daylight and the change that spins
Though I ain't sure I'll ever feel nothing
I'll be settled in a simple sense
'Cause I think of you less and less
'Cause I think of you less and less
