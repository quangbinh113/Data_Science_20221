Song Name: Escalator
Call me a ghost
But mind you
I've got some pain
So real it came alive
In me (in me, in me)
In me (in me)
I halfway dissolved
I'm half dead
More than a phantom
But less than a man
Haunting her halls
Like dust
I'm halfway surprised
At the touch of her hand
On me (on me, on me)
On me (on me)
Picture perfect, broken frame
Throw it away and start all over
Lift me through a broken plane
My open wound, my escalator
