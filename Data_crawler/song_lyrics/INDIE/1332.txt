Song Name: Lonestar
Don't know who I wanna be
Don't know who I wanna be
I'm so caught up in my head
Can't see what's in front of me
I said too much said not enough
I said too much all of your love
I said too much said not enough
I said too much all of your love
Feel like a superstar
A lonely ranger
So much time wasted away I
So I went through the valley searching for answers
But I found nothing at all
I don't see myself in the mirror
So cut my hair off will I feel better
I think I'm burning out
I'll slowly fade away
Go to a different place
I don't know what to say
If my time is now
Then kiss me on the mouth
I'll leave it up to you I'll always be around
I said too much said not enough
I said too much all of your love
I said too much said not enough
I said too much all of your love
