Song Name: Fucking Married
My ex just got married
So I put myself on ice
And I know that I stopped caring
But I don't think that sounds nice
And it's too bad that I'm not sad
I'm dead inside, but at least I'm
Not fucking married
'Cause I'm so cute, I'm 22
And I've got so much left to do
You turned 23, got that degree
Get out the door, get on that knee
And get fucking married
And it don't hurt to make it work
But I'm not you and it's not June
So I'm good with waiting
Did Virgin Mary make it scary?
Was it too hard to last 'til thirty?
Jehovah's Witness in your business
It's not you, it's all the tension
To get fucking married
I wish you the best, but that sounds like shit
And I'm so glad that I'm not it
'Cause I'm so cute, I'm 22
And I've got so much left to do
You turned 23, got that degree
Get out the door, get on that knee
'Cause I'm so cute, I'm 22
And I've got so much left to do
You turned 23, got that degree
Get out the door, get on that knee
And get fucking married
I say amen to you
I guess it's what a man's gotta do
(Guess it's what a man's gotta do)
Here comes the bride
Heaven's looking forward to you
(Heaven's looking forward to you)
I say amen to you
I guess it's what a man's gotta do
(Guess it's what a man's gotta do)
Heaven's looking forward to you
(Guess it's what a man's gotta do)
Guess it's what a man's gotta do
