Song Name: This Time
Tonight the sky above
Reminds me how to love
Walking through wintertime
Where the stars all shine
The angel on the stairs
Will tell you I was there
Under the front porch light
On a mystery night
I've been sitting watching life pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back? Could I get you off my mind
This time
The neon lights in bars
And headlights from the cars
Have started a symphony
Surrounding me
The things I left behind
Have melted in my mind
And now there's a purity
Inside of me
I've been sitting watching life pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back? Could I get you off my mind
This time
I've been sitting watching life pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back? Could I get you off my mind
This time
