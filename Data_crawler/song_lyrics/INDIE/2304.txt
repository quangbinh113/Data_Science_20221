Song Name: She Don't Use Jelly
I know a girl who thinks of ghosts,
She'll make you breakfast, she'll make you toast.
But she don't use butter.
And she don't use cheese.
She don't use jelly, or any of these.
She uses Vaseline

I know a guy who goes to shows,
When he's at home an' he blows his nose,
He don't use tissues,
Or his sleeves,
He don't use napkins, or any of these.
He uses Magazines

I know a girl who reminds me of Cher,
She's always changin' the color of her hair,
But she don't use nothin', That you buy at the store,
