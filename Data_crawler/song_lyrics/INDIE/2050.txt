Song Name: When the Sun Hits
Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast, it scares me
Mind games, don't leave me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey, hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song, yeah (hey, hey)
Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast, it scares me
Mind game, don't lose me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey, hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song, yeah (hey, hey)
Sweet thing I watch you (burn away)
Sweet thing I watch you (burn away)
Sweet thing I watch you (burn away)
