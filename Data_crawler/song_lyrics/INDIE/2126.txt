Song Name: Flight Risk
How could I do, this right?
If I'm such a flight risk
I wanted to be something
You couldn't put down, but hey
It's wearing me out this time
I wanted to stay, I tried
But you'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
If I'm already gone
I wanted to be something
Already gone
I wanted to be something
But I'm already
