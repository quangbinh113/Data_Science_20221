Song Name: Kerosene
He's pouring gasoline
Two steps ahead of me
I told him, "Baby please
Come set it all alight"
You know to set the scene
Maybe it's meant to be
'Cause I don't usually
But I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Now you set the tone
I can't let it go
Craving kerosene
Let's do cardio
Take a video
Make a star of me
He's pouring gasoline
Two steps ahead of me
I told him, "Baby please
Come set it all alight"
You know to set the scene
Maybe it's meant to be
'Cause I don't usually
But I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Now you set the tone
I can't let it go
Craving kerosene
I want you tonight
Let's do cardio
Take a video
Make a star of me
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
