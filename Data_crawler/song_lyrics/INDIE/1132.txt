Song Name: Don't Forget to Breathe
I'm still learning to love
Still holding my tongue
Still playing where it's safest
And I'm still trying to be strong
Still stumbling along
To people and to places
That will take me where I need to be
Find out who I'm calling me
Life has only begun
And already I'm
Not sure if I can make it
But it's fine, I'm learning to fly
I'm saying goodbye
To people and to places
That make me less than I can be
Don't care if I'm really me
I am ready to try
This thing we call life
Though I won't do it perfect
And I'm still so terrified
Still so scared to die
But maybe it's all worth it
If I go to where I need to be
Find out who I'm calling me
Fight off all the negatives, the worries and the doubts
And don't forget to breathe
