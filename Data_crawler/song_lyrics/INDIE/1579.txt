Song Name: Mr. Blue Sky
Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies
The sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining
Everybody's in the play
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
Hey, hey, hey!
Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city
All the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today!
Hey, hey, hey!
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey, you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race!
A celebration
Mr. Blue Sky's up there waiting
And today is the day we've waited for
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there Mr. Blue!
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there Mr. Blue!
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you!
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creeping over, now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind, I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way!
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)
We're so pleased to be with you (sky)
Look around see what you do (blue)
Everybody smiles at you
Please turn me over
