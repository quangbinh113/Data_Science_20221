Song Name: My Love - Edit
I was always able to write my way out
The song always made sense to me
Now I find that when I look down
Every page is empty
There is nothing to describe
Except the moon
Still bright against the worrying sky
I pray the trees will get their leaves soon
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

And when it came, it was stranger
Than I had ever imagined
No cracking open of heaven
But quiet and still (all my friends are getting ill)
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied (ha!)
