Song Name: always
Let's be glorious
Hey
Where'd you go?
Could've sworn that you were sleepin' over
Say
I don't know
But I thought that we were starting over
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool
To think that we always would?
(Yes or no, this is your last chance, no beating around the bush)
Gone
Not a trace
And it's almost like it never happened
No
Not the same
Guess it hurt me more than I imagined
We always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool
To think that we always would?
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool
To think that we always would
