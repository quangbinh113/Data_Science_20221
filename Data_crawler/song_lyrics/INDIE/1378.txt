Song Name: Never There Enough
You called me up last night and said you want me to know
That I've been gone too long and you've been feeling alone
And you tell me that I'm never there enough
And I know that you can always call my bluff
So I swear it isn't you, it's everyone
Maybe I'm no fun
Made me out to be someone that you know isn't me
I've been caring in all the ways I could never be
Half as cynical, is it possible that I'm not?
I don't know how to give you everything that you want
Ooh, not a day goes by, not a day goes by
That I'm not thinking 'bout you, ooh
You might not notice, I gotta focus, know that I do
Ooh, not a day goes by, not a day goes by
That I'm not thinking 'bout you, ooh
You might not notice, I might not show, but I know that I do
Think I'm always right for you, I'm down to be wrong
Just give us one more try before you start to move on
But I know that I am never there enough
So lonely in there before it even begun
But I swear it isn't you, it's everyone
Maybe I'm just numb
Made me out to be someone that you know isn't me
I've been caring in all the ways I could never be
Half as cynical, is it possible that I'm not?
I don't know how to give you everything that you want
Ooh, not a day goes by, not a day goes by
That I'm not thinking 'bout you, ooh
You might not notice, I might not show
In all that I do
Ooh, not a day goes by, not a day goes by
That I'm not thinking 'bout you
You might not show, yes, you might not show
As long that I do
