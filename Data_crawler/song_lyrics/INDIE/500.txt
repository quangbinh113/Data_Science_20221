Song Name: Lover Is a Day
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget

Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy
Straight up ahead you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder, lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about
How I feel about you
And those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell
Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have
Brightness gone, so dark without you, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy
Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self-worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas or the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy ending princess me
Processing the information, transferred from your mind to me
At light speed, like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me, when I was six and no worries
Would stop me from reaching the stars, a million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
Like a plague hitting my body
Except if I fall I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge alterations are acknowledged
And the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun, wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy, at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me
This emotion will be gone before you know
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy
