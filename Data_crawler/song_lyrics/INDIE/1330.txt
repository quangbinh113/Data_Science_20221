Song Name: clam chowder
Fuck
Did you save me a donut?
(No)
Bro
(You didn't ask) I-, yes!
I told you I wanted one of the pink ones dog
(You did not bro, this-, this is what I'm talking about bro)
(You always say all this shit that isn't even real)
Telephone Dino
Tell him to fill up on San Pellegrino
My acid amino
My ass is all bruised, I keep landing primo
(I can't land shit)
We're playing Amin√©, a lot of Pharrell, some Gunna as well
(Fuck how you feel)
Neighbors said turn that shit down, it's disturbingly loud
Get over yourself, this is perfectly loud
Just shut up
I don't wanna hear no chatter
You don't even have no power (power)
If I'm at the beach, clam chowder (chowder)
I'm in the backseat talk louder
If you don't dance, you a demon
If you don't dance, you a coward
I never do sweet, I'm sour
You never skate street, I noticed
Nike on my feet so Greek
(Don't crease)
Cannot touch me, I'm me
(I'm he)
I'm me
(I'm he)
Cannot touch me I'm me
Fuck
Texts on my phone
Shy, can you please come home?
I shouldn't have to wait this long
I sent a picture of the ocean
With the flash on, paparazzi
Had the group chat right beside me
Everything behind me
Heard they wanna start a search soon
So it's critical to execute the timing
Spot six figures hitting hill bombs into Newport
But the shadows make it difficult to find me
Poetry in motion
Me and gravity got a chemistry
Always grabbing me
It's an affinity
Now 'til infinity
(What?)
That's the mindset
Homie said it's late
I checked the time on my Timex
The moon in the sky
Reflect on my face
I don't wanna die (I don't wanna die)
But I do wanna race (I just wanna race)
I put half of a rack on myself
Only got half of it
I'll never tell
Performance was laughable
Dropped in and fell
He looked at his scratches
The restaurant started to yell
Just shut up
I don't wanna hear no chatter
You don't even have no power (power)
If I'm at the beach, clam chowder (chowder)
I'm in the backseat talk louder
If you don't dance, you a demon
If you don't dance, you a coward
I never do sweet, I'm sour
You never skate street, I noticed
Nike on my feet so Greek
(Don't crease)
Cannot touch me, I'm me
(I'm he)
I'm me
(I'm he)
Cannot touch me I'm me
Fuck
Shoutout to Mo's and the Chowder Bowl shit and all of them
Fuck you
