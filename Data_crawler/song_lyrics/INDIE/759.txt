Song Name: Like Real People Do
I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
I knew that look, dear, eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
