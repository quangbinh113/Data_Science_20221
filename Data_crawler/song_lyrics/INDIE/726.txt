Song Name: striptease
Do you remember when we kissed in the bathroom?

Damn, that was just two hours ago

Your shoelaces were untied
She said to me, "That's how I like mine"
On and on
Like you were my first love
We could just runaway
Not tell anybody
I really like the way your hair blows looking back at me
This feels like some bullshit teenage summer dream
The stereo's slapping me across the face
We're running low on gas but we don't have a place to go
Oh come on baby, baby
Oh come on baby, baby
Oh come on baby, baby
Oh come on baby, baby
You're t-t-teasing me in the car
You told me that your house is not far
Can't we just go to the beach
I think we both know what we need
On and on
Like you were my first love
We could just runaway
Not tell anybody
I really like the way your hair blows looking back at me
This feels like some bullshit teenage summer dream
The stereo's slapping me across the face
We're running low on gas but we don't have a place to go
