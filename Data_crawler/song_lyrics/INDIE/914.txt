Song Name: Stay A Little Longer
Will you ever come find me?
Will you ever come find me?
Will you ever be mine?
Need you now, oh hold me closer
Need you now, oh hold me closer
Stop the wheels of time
When I close my eyes
You're here by my side
Oh, when I close my eyes
You're here by my side
All I ever really need is your love
Nothing I could say would ever be enough
Stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me?
Stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me?
I have been waiting for something new
I have been waiting for something new
Now I know it's for you
The silver lining to my dark cloud
The silver lining to my dark cloud
Truth in this world of doubt
Now that I have you
Oh, don't let me go
Now that I have you
Oh, don't let me go
Oh, I know that time to leave has come
I'm not ready for this moment to be done
Stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me?
Stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me?
Won't let go, cannot ever let go
The light of your memories
Won't let go, cannot ever let go
Every joy, every misery
Won't let go, cannot ever let go
The light of your memories
Won't let go, cannot ever let go
Every joy, every misery
Oh-ho, what's this feeling?
It's just so true
Cross the seven seas
Gave my life for you
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
Stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me, baby?
Please stay a little longer with me, baby
Won't you stay a little longer with me?

Don't ever leave me now
Don't you please
Stay a little longer with me baby
Won't you stay?
Need you here with me
