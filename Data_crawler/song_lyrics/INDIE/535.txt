Song Name: I Don't Wanna Know
Stay away from me
Changed my locks
Throw away your key
I'm okay, thanks anyway
Don't need another dose of your misery
No use in coming over
This road is going nowhere
The lights are flashing danger
You've turned into a stranger
Not looking for a re-up
You know I don't believe ya'
When you told me you're sorry for your crimes
If you listen closely
Your heart is dripping gold
Everything about you
Is something that you stole
Now you're feeling lonely
Well, I told you so
If you wanna love me
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna
Strung to your vines
Now I'm free like the ocean tide
Everyday that you're gone
You're getting closer to where you belong
No use in coming over
This road is going nowhere
The lights are flashing danger
You've turned into a stranger
Not looking for a re-up
You know I don't believe ya'
When you told me you're sorry for your crimes
If you listen closely
Your heart is dripping gold
Everything about you
Is something that you stole
Now you're feeling lonely
Well, I told you so
If you wanna love me
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna know
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
I don't wanna
I don't wanna know
Oh, no
If you listen closely
Your heart is dripping gold
Everything about you is something that you stole
Now you're feeling lonely
Well, I told you so
If you wanna love me
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
