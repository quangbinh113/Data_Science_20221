Song Name: Tonight You Belong To Me
I know (I know)
You belong to somebody new
But tonight you belong to me
Although (although) we're apart
You're a part of my heart
And tonight you belong to me
Wait down by the stream
How sweet it will seem
Once more just to dream
In the moonlight
My honey, I know (I know)
With the dawn that you will be gone
But tonight you belong to me
Wait down, wait down along the stream
How very, very sweet it will seem
Once more just to dream
In the silvery moonlight
My honey, I know (I know)
With the dawn that you will be gone
But tonight you belong to me
Just to little old me
