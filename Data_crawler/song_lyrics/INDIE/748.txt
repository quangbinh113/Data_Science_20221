Song Name: blind
She got the gold hoops, Prada fit
I'm in love with all of it
Ex -oy didn't get the picture, cut him out of it
I fall pretty hard, never really getting far
You make everyone look like they aren't anyone
I haven't felt a thing this year
And I'm only tryin' to be sincere
Yeah, I've never seen something quite like you
I've never seen something quite like you
I try to look away, but something's in the way
I think I'm going blind, I hope it doesn't change
'Cause I've never seen something quite like you
But you're a little like me, same type
Cancels every date night
Stays home, never leaves
Just can't find the energy
I stay pretty numb, never fell for anyone
You seem similar, always end up getting hurt
I haven't felt a thing this year
And I'm only tryin' to be sincere
Yeah, I've never seen something quite like you
I've never seen something quite like you
I try to look away, but something's in the way
I think I'm going blind, I hope it doesn't change
'Cause, I've never seen something quite like you
And you're not one for conversation
Always running out of patience
I'd like to think that we're the same
I don't even know your name
All I'm really tryin' to say is
I've never seen something quite like you
And I've never seen something quite like you
I try to look away, but something's in the way
I think I'm going blind, I hope it doesn't change
'Cause, I've never seen something quite like you
