Song Name: 4 Seasons
Who am I to judge
The people who don't care for me
When I don't care about them either
And who am I to judge
The friends that I once thought I knew
They're all off doing what they wanna do
I'm falling to pieces
When I'm on my own
Even though I'm a walking emotion
And I can't go a day without you
I saw myself as less and you saw high above me
But I hope that you can learn to love me
Four seasons, they've flied by
And I cry usually in the evening
Before I calm myself and start sleeping
And I'm asleeping cause each weekend is like a Monday to me
She stays behind a bar at work
So I'm getting Redbull for free
And I'm so bored of being awkward
I hit my head against a door
All night she may be much less awkward, I'm not so awkward anymore
And I'm flying back to LA
And I can't wait for her to see
And I'm not fucking with first class
But I sure like a sleeper seat, so
I'll find a spot that's just for me
And see if I can cope without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain
Now that you're around I pray you don't go
And we don't even need to mention all the things that matter
Or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell why your day was good
And love me after hours
Now that you're around I pray you don't go
Cause since you made me social, I'm not longer even solo
So thank you, and thanks bro for the sweater shirt and the front row
Sweater shirt that's young me playin' Erica, afro
Way back, back when I would have worn a snapback
But fuck that, fuck that
And I hate myself for what I'm 'bout to say
But I feel as if it's time to get away
I'll find a spot that's just for me
And see if I can cope without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain
Said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually things die
But if only he'll remember my name
One final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually things die
But if only he'll remember my name
One final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually things die
But if only he'll remember my name
One final time
All the things that matter
Or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell why your day was good
And love me after hours
Now that you're around I pray you don't go
Cause since you made me social, I'm not longer even solo
Said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually things die
But if only he'll remember my name
One final time
