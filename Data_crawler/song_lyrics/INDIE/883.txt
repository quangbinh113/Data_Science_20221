Song Name: Favorite T-Shirt
I've been sittin' here, tryna figure out
What did I do right to be with you right now?
I put my arm around your shoulder
To see If I can pull you closer
And I didn't wanna say it
But I honestly thought I'm growin' older
I saw your eyes in the city lights
And almost said, "I want you so bad tonight"
Yeah, you were kissing my neck, you were making me nervous
And none of our friends would believe it
You were puttin' your hands up under my shirt
Makin' fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mulholland drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
Heart is beatin' harder than it ever has
Wanna put you in a photo, put you on my dash
I put my arm around your shoulder
To see If I can pull you closer
And I didn't wanna say it
But I honestly thought I'm growin' older
I saw your eyes in the city lights
And almost said, "I want you so bad tonight"
Yeah, you were kissing my neck, you were making me nervous
And none of our friends would believe it
You were puttin' your hands up under my shirt
Makin' fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mulholland drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
No, it doesn't really fit, but you don't really care
'Cause you said you were cold and you need it
Hope you're gonna forget that you ever put it on
'Cause you gotta see me if you keep it
Parked out at the end of your drive
Kiss me through the window one more time
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
Yeah, I've been sitting here, tryna figure out
What did I do right to be with you right now?
You were kissing my neck, you were making me nervous
And none of our friends would believe it
You were puttin' your hands up under my shirt
Makin' fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mulholland drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
No, it doesn't really fit, but you don't really care
'Cause you said you were cold and you need it
Hope you're gonna forget that you ever put it on
'Cause you gotta see me if you keep it
Parked out at the end of your drive
Kiss me through the window one more time
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
In my favorite T-Shirt
You look so good, it hurts
In my favorite T-Shirt
