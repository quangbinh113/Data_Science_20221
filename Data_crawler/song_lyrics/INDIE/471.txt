Song Name: Prune, You Talk Funny
I like the way that words come out your mouth
It takes me many miles to make them out
And strawberry sits superbly with you
Go on and lick me love I'm jelly in my shoes
Prune
And I would tread upon flowerbeds to stare and stop
A hominid twas blossoming from soot and sod
Prune
Eating all my food
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
I like the way you decorate your neck
It takes me just a sec to break a sweat
And russet rims portray that of a goon
Go on and test me love like sipping from a spoon
Prune
And I would tread upon flowerbeds to stare and stop
A hominid twas blossoming from soot and sod
Prune
Eating all my food
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
