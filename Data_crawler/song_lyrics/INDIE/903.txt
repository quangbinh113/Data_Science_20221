Song Name: Favorite T-Shirt - Acoustic
I've been sitting here tryin' to figure out
What did I do right to be with you right now
I put my arm 'round your shoulder
To see if I could pull you closer
And I didn't wanna say it
But honestly thought of growing older
I saw your eyes in the city lights
And almost said I want you so bad tonight
Yeah
You were kissing my neck
You were making me nervous
And none of our friends would believe it
You were putting your hands up under my shirt
Making fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mulholland Drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
You look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
Heart is beating harder than it ever has
Wanna put you in a photo
Put you on my dash
I put my arm 'round your shoulder
To see if I could pull you closer
And I didn't want to say it
But honestly thought of growing older
I saw your eyes in the city lights
And almost said I want you so bad tonight
Yeah
You were kissing my neck
You were making me nervous
And none of our friends would believe it
You were putting your hands up under my shirt
Making fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mulholland Drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
And you look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
No it doesn't really fit
But you don't really care
'Cause you said you were cold and you need it
Hope you're gonna forget that you ever put it on
'Cause you've gotta see me if you keep it
Parked out at the end of your drive
Kissed me through the window one more time
You look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
Yeah, I've been sitting here trying to figure out
What did I do right to be with you right now
You were kissing my neck
You were making me nervous
And none of our frienda would believe it
You were putting your hands up under my shirt
Making fun of the way I was breathing
Parked up on Mullholland Drive
Blankets in the back of my car all night
And you look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
No it doesn't really fit
But you don't really care
'Cause you said you were cold and you need it
Hope you're gonna forget that you ever put it on
'Cause you've gotta see me if you keep it
Parked out at the end of your drive
Kissed me through the window one more time
You look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
In my favorite t-shirt
You look so good it hurts
In my favorite t-shirt
