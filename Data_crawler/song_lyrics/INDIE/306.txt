Song Name: Pulling Leaves Off Trees
Will I regret it if I let you swing me along
The guy you'll meet tomorrow, will he know where you're from?
And not what good will it do, will it do if I wait?
He's trying to belittle my political views
I fucking hate depression, so I don't watch the news
The more aware that I am, the more I won't wanna say
The closer I get, I don't wanna see
Hearing footsteps coming after me
Pick up the pace, but I don't know where to go
Give me time, you're pulling me around
Got me nervous, fall and hit the ground
Season's changing but them again so am I
Woah, out in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call
Woah, who can pitch him for me, may not a problem, maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear you
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, is it now what I want to see
To be
Oh!
Can I make my own opinion, tell me all about it
If everyone approves of it, I wanna scream and shout it
And they all wanna see us, I think it could be a sign
Adolescence forming at the line
They move way too quick to give the time
They're all the same, but how much different am I?
Woah, out in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call
Woah, who can pitch him for me, may not a problem, maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear you
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, is it now what I want to see
To be
Oh!
If you want it, I can take it, make it a little better
I will be here when the weather changes
You'll be waiting for the latter
I won't run away
This time I got too much to lose
I will be here when it goes on
Woah, out in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call
Woah, who can pitch him for me, may not a problem, maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear you
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, is it now what I want to see
To be
To breathe
And not to breathe
Oh!
