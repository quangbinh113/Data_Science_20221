Song Name: Lisztomania
So sentimental, not sentimental no
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Oh, this is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Oh, this is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Time, time to show it off, time to show it off
It's time to show it off
Time, time to show it off, time to show it off
It's time to show it off
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, discouraged
