Song Name: Futon
Just my luck
Saw you looking at her
Am I not enough?
Do I even matter?
Will you call my bluff?
You don't even answer your phone
And now I'm alone, oh-oh
Noticing you
Are you noticing me?
No dissing her
But you should be with me
I can make it better if you hold on
We could be together for like so long
Sleeping in your sweater on my futon
You should just forget her and we'll move on
Left on read
Saw you're at that party
With your fake ass friends (ew)
Yeah, they don't invite me
I'm just in my bed
Slowly scrolling down on my phone
I'm always alone, oh-oh
Noticing you
Are you noticing me?
No dissing her
But you should be with me
I can make it better if you hold on
We could be together for like so long
Sleeping in your sweater on my futon
You should just forget her and we'll move on
I try to, try to love you
I try to, try to love you
I tried to and now we're so through
I try to, try to love you, oh-oh
I can make it better if you hold on (hold on)
We could be together for like so long
Sleeping in your sweater on my futon (my futon)
You should just forget her and we'll move on (move on)
I can make it better if you hold on (hold on)
We could be together for like so long (so long)
Sleeping in your sweater on my futon
You should just forget her and we'll move on
