Song Name: Cashmere
You ain't safe until you've lived your life with no fear
You can't live until we cry every beautiful tear
It ain't easy 'til it goes 'specially when you're sinful
Camouflage my darkest thoughts, disconnecting the ties
Do what you gotta do, deep in a dark web
Things we find in there shouldn't be seen by anyone
Do what you gotta do, there's not a lot in me left
You know it's hard on me
This time is the last time 'cause I'm soft like cashmere
Spreading out like a wildfire, we so outta control
Winter's where we fall
Falling deep in our thoughts
Miss me when I'm gone
That's usually how it goes, like
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere
As long as we been in time like the memories
Slow it down in the centuries
I don't think I could see the future
Right at the middle we became enemies
Centimeters from telling me
That you always felt my love abuse ya
And I'm about to lose ya
I guess it never goes easier
Where's the service when you need it?
So I disconnected myself (oh no)
And when I wanted your wisdom
You just gave me a reason to put a hole in your chest
Heartbreak Hotel, black magic spell
Can't find myself again, oh well
No. 5 Chanel, channel my inner spirit
Freedom calling, Eden calling, I could never stay
It's your mistake and I don't wanna save you
Do what you gotta do, deep in a dark web
Things we find in there shouldn't be seen by anyone
Do what you gotta do, there's not a lot of me left
You know it's hard on me
This time is the last time 'cause I'm soft like cashmere
Spreading out like a wildfire, we so outta control
Winter's where we fall
Falling deep in our thoughts
Miss me when I'm gone
That's usually how it goes, like
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere
Spreading out like a wildfire
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere
Spreading out like a wildfire
Spreading out like a wildfire
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere
Spreading out like a wildfire
