Song Name: Bad Decisions
Dropped down the lights, I'm sitting with you
Moscow, 1972
Always singing in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams
Oh, making bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions
Making bad decisions for you
Oh, making bad decisions
Uh-oh, making bad decisions
I'm making bad decisions for you
Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone
Oh, baby, I hang on everything you say
I wanna write down every word
But do me a favor when you come close
When I look around, don't wanna see you
I don't take advice from fools
Never listening to you
Oh, making bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions for you
Oh, making bad decisions
Uh-oh, making bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions with you
Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone
You, you didn't listen to me
But I, I didn't listen to you
I waited so long
Listening for
Something to work
I'm making bad decisions
Really, really bad decisions
I'm making bad decisions
On you, on you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not gonna give a lot of credit
I don't how to use how
'Cause I can't, I can't
I can't, can't make anymore
