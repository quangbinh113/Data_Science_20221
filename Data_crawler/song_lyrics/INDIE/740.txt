Song Name: redesign
Rain, rain go away, come again another day
I wanna live forever but mental illness gets in the way
I feel so compelled when mania helps itself
I cut my bangs and dye my hair, I do it so well
Look how beautiful it is, I am not in charge of this
And when I come down, I know that I'll be pissed
There's something inside that fucking hurts me every time
I've tried every single pill to help me chill, and I'm not satisfied
One minute, I'll be fucked, and the next minute I'm fine
I can't believe myself, I'm overwhelmed, I think I've lost my mind
Don't romanticize my life
I need a redesign
Don't romanticize my life

I, I need a redesign
I have the good days, good phase, feeling like I like my face
And body, taking pictures, 'cause I know I'm a hottie
Then the bad days comes in waves, feelin' like I gained weight
Wish I could be disembody, and be somebody else
'Cause I'm unwell, I can't control myself
I'm asking for help (I'm asking for help)
There's something inside that fucking hurts me every time
I've tried every single pill to help me chill, and I'm not satisfied
One minute, I'll be fucked, and the next minute I'm fine
I can't believe myself, I'm overwhelmed, I think I've lost my mind
Don't romanticize my life
I need a redesign
Don't romanticize my life

I (yeah), I need a redesign
