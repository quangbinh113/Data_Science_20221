Song Name: Mind
He took his shirt off as he ran, from you
So slowly away but I've found him
He's fine
I wasn't floating as I am
Deciding the loneliest heart in the living room, was mine
She wasn't trying to make a sound
Oh you, the only escape from her envy was her pride
Oh, that's not really who I am
The deadliest sins are for those who are taken and not I
Oh, it was only a matter of time
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Carrying a plastic bag
Threw up by your side just to show me I'm lonely again
Oh, maybe I just need a man
So loosely reduced to an infant dependent on wine
Oh, it was only a matter of time
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
I can't see clear again
I got myself stuck
And I won't come here again
I'm all out of luck
He took his shirt off as he ran, from you
So slowly away but I've found him
He's fine
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
Why'd you keep changing your mind?
