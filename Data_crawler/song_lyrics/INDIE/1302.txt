Song Name: The Wire
You know I'm bad at communication, it's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said, it's the most important part that relationships will go through
And I'd give it all away just so I could say that
I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be ok anyway
You know there's no rhyme or reason for the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind, not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it but I can't bear to stay and
I just know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be ok anyway
Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire, huh
Oh will you use imagination try to make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did, but it came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be ok anyway
Well I try to keep myself together, after all the opportunities
I try to stay true to you and try to do what you wanted for me
And I'd give it all away just to hear you say that
Well I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be ok anyway
Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No-no-no-no, no, no
It felt right (It felt right)
It felt right (It felt right)
It felt right, no-no-no-no-, no, no
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Yeah
