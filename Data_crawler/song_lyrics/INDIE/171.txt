Song Name: Dream About U
The flowers are gray and pink
And all I remember thinkin'
Was, "This is how it's supposed to be"
And now that I've seen your face
My mind goes to a stupid place
But I hope you'll remember me
And none of this will make sense
I can hide through words all I please
But even when I'm six feet underground
You still got me on my knees
Dreams cannot compare
To seein' you standin' there in front of me
It's crazy how much I found
I'd love for you to stick around
And to stay with me
And none of this will make sense
I can hide through words all I please
But even when I'm six feet underground
You still got me on my knees
Yeah, you still got me on my knees
