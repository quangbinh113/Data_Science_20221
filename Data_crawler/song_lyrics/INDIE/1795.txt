Song Name: What I Want
When I go out again
I'm gonna drink a lot
I'm gonna take a shot
'Cause that's just what I want, want, want
What I want, want, want, hmm
And when I see my friend
Put something on her tongue
I'm gonna ask for one
'Cause that's just want I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want
I've spent way too-too-too many years not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want
I want the full effects
I want to hit it hard
I want to dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong, with what I want
Yeah, yeah
I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong, with what I want
Yeah, yeah
Shе's dancing to the song
With all that leather on
I think wе'll get along
'Cause she's got what I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want
I've spent way too-too-too many years
Not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for all of it at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want
I want the full effects
I want to hit it hard
I want to dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong with what I want
Yeah, yeah
I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong with what I want
Yeah, yeah
My hands are shaking, it's psychosomatic
That's how bad I want what I want
What I (want)
What I want
I'm gonna take it, I'm just gonna grab it
That's how bad I want what I want
What I (want)
What I want
I've spent too-too-too many years
I've cried too-too-too many tears
And now I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that just what I want
I want the full effects
I want to hit it hard
I want to dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong with what I want
Yeah, yeah
I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, ooh-ooh
That's what I want, there's nothing wrong with what I want
Yeah, yeah
