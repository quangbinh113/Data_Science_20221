Song Name: Alive
Frustrate my call sucks bright flowers in the bed
Brings back memories you'd rather just leave dead now and in the past
Sounds ungrateful but it's all in good context
When that old Suburban would work for me no less 'cause I know
Is it all alive?
Is it all alive?
All alive?
Is it all alive?
I don't know what to talk about
Zoned out for a second
I missed the route
You missed the route
God, tell me that you're not that dumb like you seem to be
Well, I can't make any kinda promises though things change rapidly
Well, I don't want no one that's all worked up about me (ha-ha)
Alive
Alive
Alive
Is it alive?
