Song Name: Street You Live On
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain, wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
And you weren't lyin'
When you said you'd go quiet
I'm an empty drawer, not borrowing your socks anymore
Then why am I cryin'?
We've done this 15 times, and
I'm a paper map rerouting different ways to the store
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet, pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain, wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
We're turning the corner
I think I'm getting warmer
I'm a fеral cat I'm licking up the milk at your door
A serial farmer
I'm harvеsting the drama
This episode of Criminal Minds is too real to ignore
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain, wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain, wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain, wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
