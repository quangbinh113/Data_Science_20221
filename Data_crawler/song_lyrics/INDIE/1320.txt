Song Name: gimme all ur luv
I fell
Deep in the art
I fell
Where did it start?
(Ohh)
I fell
Deep in the art
I fell
When did it start?
I don't get it
The feeling's a fire
I regret it
The mind is a liar
Yet, I fell (I fell)
Straight to the top
A weak high
Will it ever stop?
All in all, it was a typical Tuesday
And he just happened to be coming my way
Surely I'm not insane
I just want love
I'll take anyone
I need your attention
In this frail dimension of a brain
I just want love
(Didn't know my sturdy heart can be so brittle)
I'll take anyone
(Gimme all your love and I'll back off a little)
(Vroom, vroom)
Then a table for two
Tell me all the things you want to do to me
