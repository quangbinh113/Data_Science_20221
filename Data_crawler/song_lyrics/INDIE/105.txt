Song Name: Remember When
Thought I saw your shadow under the door
Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
Anymore, anymore
I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in your room
And I couldn't find the right words to use
But I knew that you knew
It seems so long, it seemed so long
The moments that stay, they turn out all wrong
When I look around, you're gone
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
All the places that return to
All the faces that remind you
I can still see you at the place out there when I close my eyes
Do you remember when we felt like the only two alive?
Don't let me be one of the people that seek a lost romance
Would you go and do it all over again, given a chance?
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
