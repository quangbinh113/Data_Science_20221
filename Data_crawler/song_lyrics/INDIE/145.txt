Song Name: p.s.
Some days I feel like givin' up, givin' in
Losin' hope, losin' friends
I've been trying hard not to lose my breath
Ever since you left, but if this is the end
When good ain't good enough
The road is right and rough
You'll always be alright with me
If you ever feel alone, I just wanted you to know
I wrote you this song to sing
It goes like
P.S., I miss you when you feel alone
P.S., I'm with you, wherever you go
P.S., I get you, so, P.S., come home
P.S., I love you, that's all that I know
I've got seeds, 'cause if we reap what we sow
I've planted you a garden
Where your flowers can grow
I believe in you and me and at
The seams we can solve
I've planted you a garden
Where your flowers can grow
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Will this be forever?
I guess we'll wait and see
Even if we're not together
We'll forever be we
