Song Name: i don't feel part of the world anymore
Father forgive me for you know that I am always sinnin'
I take no interest partyin' with liquor fuckin' up my system
Excuse my language, that's the hangup on how shitty I been feelin'
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh, oh, oh
Father forgive me for you know that I am always sinnin'
I take no interest partyin' with liquor fuckin' up my system
Excuse my language, that's the hangup on how shitty I been feelin'
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh, oh, oh
Father forgive me for you know that I am always sinnin'
I take no interest partyin' with liquor fuckin' up my system
Excuse my language, that's the hangup on how shitty I been feelin'
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh, oh, oh
