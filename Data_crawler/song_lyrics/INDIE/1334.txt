Song Name: cabin fever
Saus, what you do?
While running home, I realised it's fine
'Cause everything's okay, it just takes some time
'Cause the world's on fire, and we're all gonna die
But it'll be okay, it just takes some time
I think I need some space
Maybe some peace of mind
I write songs in my bedroom and stay inside
But I feel okay, yeah, I feel just fine (fine, fine, fine)
While running home, I realised it's fine
'Cause everything's okay, it just takes some time
'Cause the world's on fire, and we're all gonna die
But it'll be okay, it just takes some time
I think I need some space
Maybe some peace of mind
I write songs in my bedroom and stay inside
But I feel okay, yeah, I feel just fine (fine, fine, fine)
