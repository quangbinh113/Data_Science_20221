Song Name: Transients
Home is where the heart is
Been thinking about Japan
Drinking highballs from a can
These rose colored glasses
The memories are sweet
It beats grinding my teeth
Living back in New York 2018
Driving out to LA felt like a dream
Half a year in Portland getting lost biking home
I've been getting depressed reading the news
Can't get out of bed, don't know what to do
Seeing my friends only through this shattered screen
I woke up crying from that same dream
I still have no clue what it all means
Read about the world on a bright screen
I just wanna get some sleep
I woke up crying from that same dream
I still have no clue what it all means
Don't wanna know about the world anymore
Just wanna go back to how we were before
I've been living life backwards
Missing my own apartment again
Wasting my time trying to explain it (oh)
I've been living life backwards
Now I'm wasted floating up through the ceiling
Holding on a feeling
Cant read what you're needing
I don't know how to be alone
Living back in New York 2018
Driving out to LA felt like a dream
Half a year in Portland getting lost biking home
I've been getting depressed reading the news
Can't get out of bed don't know what to do
Seeing my friends only through this shattered screen
I woke up crying from that same dream
I still have no clue what it all means
Read about the world on a bright screen
I just wanna get some sleep
I woke up crying from that same dream
I still have no clue what it all means
Don't wanna know about the world anymore
Just wanna go back to how we were before
