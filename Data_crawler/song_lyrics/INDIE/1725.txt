Song Name: Broken
Wil you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going
Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going insane
Most people are searching for happiness
They're looking for it
They're trying to find it in someone
Or something outside of themselves
That's a fundamental mistake
Happiness is something that you are
And it comes from the way you speak
Can you break my bones?
Will you tear my skin?
Can you taste my lust?
Can you feel my sin?
See, I'm a waste of life
I should just kill myself
Yeah, I could slit my wrists
But it really wouldn't help
Wouldn't fix my issues
Or change your mind
'Cause I broke your heart
And you buried mine
Now, I'm six feet deep
And I can't breathe
I got dirt in my eyes
And blood on my sleeves
But I dig my way up
Through these roots and leaves
So I can get some air
So I can finally breathe
And now I'm on my knees
Oh baby, begging please
Will you
Will you
Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going
Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going insane
We cannot choose the things that will happen to us
But we can choose the attitude we want to take
Towards anything that happens to us
Goodbye
And don't you miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Goodbye
Don't you miss me when I'm, miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Fucking reason that I'm not around
Bitch, you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
