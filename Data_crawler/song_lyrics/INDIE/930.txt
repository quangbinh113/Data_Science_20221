Song Name: Waves - Robin Schulz Radio Edit
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground,
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around
I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)

Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the
Drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting

Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the
