Song Name: I’m Not Perfect (But I’m Trying)
Never in or out, indecisive
Never did I think I'd be doing this alone
Now we're upside down, blinded
I'll admit defeat I can barely sleep at all
I'd walk on water if I could
To be loved, to be understood
What's it worth, was it for the good?
For the good
I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
Pick my moment then I'll dive in
I've had my fair share of mistakes so for now it's far too late
I'll wait until the tide's in
If it's all about the timing
I don't feel enough, what's the need to rush for now?
I see clouds without a silver lining
When I hesitate nothing ever lets mе down
I'd walk on water if I could
To be loved, to bе understood
What's it worth, was it for the good?
For the good
I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
Pick my moment then I'll dive in
I've had my fair share of mistakes so for now it's far too late
I'll wait until the tide's in
Ooh-ooh
I'll wait until the tide's in (ooh-ooh)
I'll wait until the tide's in (ooh-ooh)
Water, dive in
Even when times get difficult
Water, dive in
Even when times
I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
Pick my moment then I'll dive in
I've had my fair share of mistakes so for now it's far too late
I'll wait until the tide's in
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll wait until
I'll wait until the tide goes in
Water, dive in (oh, dive in)
Water, dive in
