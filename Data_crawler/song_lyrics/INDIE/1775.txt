Song Name: Coffee Breath
Woke up in your new apartment
In your twin-size bed
Coffee starting
Don't remember much
All I know is that you talk too much
Time to go
You've got those big blue eyes
Drive me crazy
Make me fantasize 'bout you baby
And you smell so sweet, like fresh-picked daisies
Call me Dahmer 'cause your heart's so tasty
And I watched you break
Like glass, you shatter
Said it's my mistake, I make things harder
So I tried my best, to shut my mouth
But all the thoughts I hid dug their way out
Said you can't trust me
I said it's fine
Because I'm not happy 'til I tell a lie
Now my bedsheets smell like your cologne
And in our separate worlds we sleep alone
