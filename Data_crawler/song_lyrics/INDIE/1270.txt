Song Name: anything
Staring down the barrel of the hot sun
Shining with the sheen of a shotgun
Carol has a little if we need some
Joyous rays, we wanna come
Hanging your jeans with a clothes pin
Skin still wet, still on my skin
Mango in your mouth, juice dripping
Shoulder of your shirtsleeve slipping
Christmas Eve with your mother and sis
Don't wanna fight but your mother insists
Dog's white teeth slice right into my fist
Drive to the ER and you put me on my wrist
Grocery store list, now you get this
Brunch, had calls and messages
I don't wanna be the owner of your fantasy
I just wanna be a part of your family
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay on your lap whеn I'm crying
Circle of pine and riddle
Circlе of moss and fire smoke
Fan on the ceiling like a wheel spoke
Push the clutch in and I pull the choke
Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking
Wanna listen to your hands soothe
Listen to your heart beating
Listen to the way you move
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
Wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying
Ordering the stars in Heaven
Hurling salt in the sea
Dragging the newborn mountain
Didn't you believe in me?
Yeah, you held me the whole way through
When I couldn't say the words like you
I was scared indigo but I wanted to
I was scared indigo but I wanted to
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying
