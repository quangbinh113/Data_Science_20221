Song Name: NEVER MET! (feat. Glitch Gum)
You know I missed you from the very day you went away
I feel like Laura Les, saying, "I love you" on the plane
And even though it's been a week, I still think of your face
Blew all my money on a trivial video game
I dunk my head in the water so I can feel something
And now I'm thinking of all the times that my phone would ring
I reminisce and remember all of the songs we'd sing
But now I hate every one of the songs we used to sing
Can you believe that I didn't think you would leave me?
And now I can't trust anyone 'cause you just left me
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met
Can you believe that I'm missing you even though
When I was with you, I never felt more alone
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-Glitch Gum)
I wish we never met
We broke up on PictoChat, crying on my DS
I went to a birthday party for one of her friends
And now that this is over I can hate them, I don't have to pretend
Remember when I called you my Barbie, and I was Ken
That was like the cringiest thing that I've ever said
When I was with you, I just felt more alone
I just hope I'm bad enough to call about
When you're on your phone
This Glitch Gum guy is so annoying
He keeps asking me to listen to these bands I can't even pronounce
And now he's making music with this guy named 'Cmten'?
I'm so done with him
Everything you said about me is just lies
I can't believe you put mascara on my eyes
I hope you don't listen and see past my disguise
'Cause I'm still kinda hurt that you're not in my life
You know I missed you from the very day you went away
I feel like Laura Les, saying, "I love you" on the plane
And even though it's been a week I still think of your face
Blew all my money on a trivial video game
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met
