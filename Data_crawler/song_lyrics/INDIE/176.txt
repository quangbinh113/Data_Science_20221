Song Name: Oh So You're Off I See
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh well they're there.
Tear up and gone.
At least we don't have to hold on to something that was never ever gonna come.
I fall, so fast.
Textiles.
Drive model cars.
I've got no dreams,
No guts,
Just inner me.
Some friends yeah I've got one or two,
Maybe you could be friends too?
Are you in, in control?
I think so.
Well maybe no.
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh well they're there.
Tear up and gone
At least we don't have to hold on to something that was never ever gonna come.
I like.
You smile.
Turns tires.
Eat chocolate bars.
I've got no dreams,
No guts,
Just inner me.
I'm trying to be sensitive,
But you, you don't care,
You're never there.
Are you in?
In or out?
Sweet or sour?
I want it now.
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh so you are off I see.
Oh well they're there.
Tear up and gone.
At least we don't have to hold on to something that was never ever gonna come.
Oh so you are off I see,
I thought maybe you were.
Didn't remember me at all.
Oh so you are off I see,
I thought maybe you were.
Didn't remember me at all.
Oh so you are off I see,
I thought maybe you were.
Didn't remember me at all.
