Song Name: Opportunity
Wake up to a morning so listless
Come in, sun is looming in
Careless, glide on over my eyelids
Show me opportunity
Give it up like i did in my old days
Shake it off 'cause I'm living in my own way
Shake it off 'cause I'm coming' round again
Laying at your door
Don't stop, let the rhythm get faster
Blindly as I stumble in
Take the lead, but my world is so backwards
Can't believe I'm at the start again
Such a fake, running way past the goal line
Laugh it off 'cause I made that joke so many times
Shake it off 'cause I'm coming 'round again
Lying at your door
Shaking it off (I never thought I'd be the last one)
Shaking it off (Now every chance i had is gone)
Shaking it off
Shaking it off (Shaking it off)
