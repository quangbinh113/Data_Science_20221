Song Name: Moonsong
There in my heart, I feel it go
The weight everything I have known
Can I decide, leave it behind
And fall away into the unknown?
I'm afraid it will come back again
And for a moment I felt nothing ever dies
Even in darkness I will try, and I'll try, and I'll try
Why does the moon up in the sky
Feel something like my family tonight
Is she alone, and does she cry
Each time we turn away from her light?
Could we ever really understand?
And maybe time is like a night that never ends
Maybe tomorrow comes again, and again, and again
