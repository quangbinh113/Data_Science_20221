Song Name: Big Bowl in the Sky
This one's for my best friend
We never spoke a word
But the way he looked into my eyes
I knew he understood
Grabbing on so tight
Like nothing matters more
My handsome little scaly guy
My pretty baby boy
I don't wanna have to miss you
I don't wanna have to say goodbye
I don't wanna have to leave you
To the big bowl in the sky
So lucky that you were mine
Put your PJs on for one last time
And I'm really gonna miss you
Rest easy little guy
Rushing home from school
Couldn't stand to be alone
But this year I had someone there
With you I had a home
If I'm friends with everyone
Or have nobody at all
You helped me see that either way
There's a place where I belong
I don't wanna have to miss you
I don't wanna have to say goodbye
I don't wanna have to leave you
To the big bowl in the sky
Though it's crushing down on me
We both know it's what you need
But I'm really gonna miss you
So rest easy buddy
Yeah I'm really gonna miss you
Rest easy for me
