Song Name: Dirty AF1s
You took your smile back to New York
But you left your toothbrush
And I hope you bought a new one
But I'd love you toothless
I used to sing while in the shower, now I don't
'Cause you're not there to sing along
While you put your makeup on
You took your smile back to New York
But you left your toothbrush
And I love you just the same
But I'm worried words lose weight
Does it hit you just as hard from three thousand miles away?
From three thousand miles away, from three
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my nice shoes on so strangers
Can't tell that I miss your dirty Air Force 1's
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my favourite shirt on so strangers
Don't know that it looks way better on you
Took my heart to California
Now it doesn't work right
Yeah, it beats and, yeah, it beats
But damn it hurts every night
You're not lonely just because you are alone
But ever since we said goodbye
Well, I just happen to be both
I took my heart to California, now it's broken
And I love you just the same
But I'm worried words lose weight
Does it hit you just as hard from three thousand miles away?
From three thousand miles away, from three
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my nice shoes on so strangers
Can't tell that I miss your dirty Air Force 1's
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my favourite shirt on so strangers
Don't know that it looks way better on you
