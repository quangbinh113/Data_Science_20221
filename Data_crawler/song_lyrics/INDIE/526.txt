Song Name: Slow Dance
Slow dance with you
I just wanna slow dance with you
I know all the other boys are tough
And smooth, and I got the blues
I wanna slow dance with you
I wanna slow dance with you
(Slow dance) I just wanna slow dance with you
(Slow dance) Why don't you take the chance?
I've got the moves I'd like to prove
I wanna slow dance with you
