Song Name: Happening Again
Oh my god, I think it's happening again
Swore to myself I would be letting it end
But every time I look at those brown eyes
Your smile, oh your smile
Run into you on our break in the hallway
And I get nervous, you're so cute there's no way
Said that out loud, well what now
Please don't let this be happening again
This already happened once
And it's already been three months but
Every time I see you, my heart goes
And I can't seem to make it stop
Try to keep it all so cool
But whenever I'm close to you I
Act like such an idiot, you'd think that I'd be over it
I'm far from being over you
Oh my god, I think it's happening again
I look for you in every single room I'm in
'Cause every time I look in your brown eyes
And your hair (your hair)
We sit in class and I figure out which seat to use
If I sit here then maybe he'll look at me too
Am I crazy? Does he see?
Maybe I don't want him to
This already happened once
And it's already been three months but
Every time I see you, my heart goes
And I can't seem to make it stop (stop)
Try to keep it all so cool
But whenever I'm close to you I
Act like such an idiot, you'd think that I'd be over it
I'm far from being over you
Somewhere in my mind, I'm looking for a sign
Really wish you'd know, seems like it's just hope
'Cause I don't really know you like that
Hate to say it, but it's just been like that
Nothing else has changed, everything's the same
Why's it been so long? Can't wish that you'd be gone
But I keep running back because I can
While you don't even put me in your plans
This already happened once
And it's already been three months but
Every time I see you, my heart goes
And I can't seem to make it stop
Try to keep it all so cool
But whenever I'm close to you I
Act like such an idiot, you'd think that I'd be over it
I'm far from being over you
I don't know why (oh my god, I think it's happening again)
I keep on trying (said that out loud, well what now)
To make you mine (every time I see you see my heart goes)
And I can't seem to make it stop
