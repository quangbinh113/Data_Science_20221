Song Name: Love I Need
I don't get the love I need anymore
I don't get the love I need anymore
I'm feelin' sick of independence
I don't get the love I need anymore
I don't get the love, I walked out the door
Oh, won't let you carry out my sentence
Well the writing was clear, it appeared on the wall
We were broken and scared unprepared for the fall
It's true, I couldn't keep waiting on you
And I know that you hurt and I know that you tried
But I'll go it alone if I can't satisfy your view
Why live a life I wasn't meant to?
But they told me, "Dance
Keep playin' the game
Press start, continue, look
Within' you, without you
Begin to advance
As far as you can
'Til you lose your winnings
Find new beginnings"
Na-na-na na-na-na
I don't get the love I need anymore
I'm cast out to sea, I can't find the shore
Don't really know what I was thinking

I don't get the love I need anymore
I'm not even sure what I'm searching for
I hear a melody and I start singing
I am lost in a dream, I can't open my eyes
Never told how to live after I say goodbye to you
They tell me, "Find another darling"
How can I find a love when I can't find myself?
When they set me adrift, made me think when I jumped
I flew but this just feels like I am falling
And they told me, "Dance
Follow the rules
The next objective
Feel defective, select
A brand new circumstance
Make lovers of fools
Go through the motions
To feel connected
Without them you're broken, broken, broken, broken"
