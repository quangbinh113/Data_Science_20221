Song Name: Alright
We are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag
Put it out, see our friends
See the sights, feel alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around, if we like
But we're alright
Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out, 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright
Are we like you
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth, nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
Are we like you
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our world
But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth, nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
