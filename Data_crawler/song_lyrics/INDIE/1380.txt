Song Name: Superlove
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I heard things about you
Not always good things, but all was wrong, oh oh-oh
'Cause I have missed you lately
And it's kinda scary that you're gone, oh-oh
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
You'll never be the one, one, ah-ah-ah
Like a year now that we've met
And I still see you that way
It's a crazy thing to think of now
I'm not broken-hearted yet
Giving all away
We'll cry another day
But my mind is blurry, it feels like somehow
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
You'll never be the one, one, ah-ah-ah
Sweetheart, we're just on the line
Between love and hitting the ground together, ah-ah
We don't hate, we don't even fight
'Cause I'm down since thirty to five and it's late, ah-ah
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
I know you'll never be the one
You'll never be the one, one, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
