Song Name: Same Light
I swear I will kill you and your eyes be mine
If you ever saw me in that room that night
The story that I've never told and never will
Took the best of me and turned me into this god-damn buzz kill
Finally, somebody picked up the phone
Missed an appointment
I wasn't home
I was here by your side
I was here by your side
If I should stay for the night
If I turned out the lights
Will you see me?
Will you see me still?
I've never been here before
Will you see me in the same light?
Will you see me in the same light?
I fell in love with the morning air in your bedroom
Life felt easy like a billionaire's
I knew that you would change me
But, oh, how you have changed me
I fell in love with the morning air in your bedroom
Life felt easy like a billionaire's
I knew that you would change me
But, oh, how you have changed me
If I should stay for the night
If I turned out the lights
Will you see me (the same)?
Will you see me still?
I've never been here before
Will you see me in the same light?
Will you see me in the same light?
Will you see me in the same light?
Will you see me in the same light?
If I could stay for the night
If I turned out the lights
Will you see me (the same)?
Will you see me still?
I've never been here before
Will you see me in the same light?
Will you see me in the same light?
