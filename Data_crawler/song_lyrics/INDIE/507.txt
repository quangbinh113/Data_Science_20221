Song Name: Malibu 1992
I watched you board an airplane
A high dive from the summer's heat wave, down
A bit tongue and a taste of iron
Sweethearts that high school soured, now
Our turn to go into a closing
You moved when you ran out of money, stay
Your parents house in Ohio
Your old bed replaced with a treadmill, now
Well I come here more than you know
And I'm sure you think I've outgrown you
But I couldn't
Ohh, I did it again, I did it again
Ohh, I did it again, I did it again
Oh, I must still want you
Our names carved in the pavement
Sealed by what's left of our handprints now
I told my mom she'd love to meet you
But it's too bad she won't get the chance to
Oh, I did it again, I know I did it again, no
Oh, I did it again
I must still want you
And I might be part to blame
And I might be part to blame
You're some old man's new trophy

Locked up in some house in New Jersey
Now money's not a problem
But 20 years it seems you've forgotten
Malibu '92
