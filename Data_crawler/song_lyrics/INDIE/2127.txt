Song Name: Billie Toppy
Billie cares to hold me
But I found I'm bound and headed upside down
Billie dressing easy
And I do enjoy the way he tucks me now
Pulley Bee'
Dragging me around
Billie cares to wake me
And I'll bend my knees neatly to its needs
Billie will be tidy
Tough as rocky streams, steady is the speed
Pulley Bee'
Hauling is your creed
Heels twist in a ballet
Whenever you're in pain, don't turn to blame
You see a lamb who's fast asleep
Please don't go out to stray
Billie by my lips dear
I can almost taste the smoky trail of myrrh
Whispers in my left ear
And I swear, you're near, the wary one I hear
Pulley Bee'
Idles in high gear
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Heels twist in a ballet
Stuck in a ballet
Whenever you're in pain, don't turn to blame
Please, don't turn to blame
You see a lamb who's fast asleep
Please don't go out to stray
Heels twist in a ballet
Stuck in a ballet
Whenever you're in pain, don't turn to blame
Please, don't turn to blame
You see a lamb who's fast asleep
Please, don't go out to stray
