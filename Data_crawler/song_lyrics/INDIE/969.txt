Song Name: Nevermind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind-
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind-
Alright, I'm ready now, ready now
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna fall back down now
Alright, I'll take it on, take it on me
Take it on me, hmm, baby
All I, I ever ask, ever ask
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my lover?
Tonight, and take it with, take it with me
Take it with me, hmm
What if I left and it made no sense

Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind
What if I left and it made no sense
