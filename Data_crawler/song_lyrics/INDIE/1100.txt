Song Name: Gold
Hey hey hey
Yeah
Sometimes I feel I overshadow you
So I make myself small you didn't ask me to
But if I unleash the beast
You'll be running from me
So I just let it be yeah
Don't wanna fight you truthfully
Making it harder than it has to be
It feels like you coming after me yeah
Now it's clear like night and day
It's not safe in my hideaway
Think it's time for me to breakout
If you can turn my dust to gold
Take me there I'm sold
I'll put all my money down
Take a risk and lose it all
Turn my dust to gold baby
Come and rock my world
I'll put all my money on it
I'm finding it hard to misbehave
If I let my guard down
I'm digging my own grave
I can't afford no more mistakes
I'll come undone
Don't wanna fight you truthfully
Making it harder than it has to be
It feels like you coming after me yeah
Now it's clear like night and day
It's not safe in my hideaway
Think it's time for me to breakout
If you can turn my dust to gold
Take me there I'm sold
I'll put all my money down
Take a risk and lose it all
Turn my dust to gold baby
Come and rock my world
I'll put all my money on it
If you can turn my dust to gold
Turn my dust to gold
If you can turn my dust to gold
I'll put all my money on it
If you could turn this dust to diamonds
I'll give you a check now baby I'm signing
If you gonna frame me
Baby don't you blame me in the end
When this house comes burning down
If you can turn my dust to gold
Take me there I'm sold
I'll put all my money down
Take a risk and lose it all
Turn my dust to gold baby
Come and rock my world
I'll put all my money on it
If you can turn my dust to gold
Turn my dust to gold
If you can turn my dust to gold
I'll put all my money on it
