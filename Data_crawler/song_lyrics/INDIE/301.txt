Song Name: Televised
Take a Tylenol took long enough to get back here, crying
Cheap tricks and fortune in a flash
She hits rewind to make it last, crying
Oh, she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes
Oh, she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I'm in paradise
Show me heart break a thousand times
I don't care to be or be caught without sweet misery by my side
Wide awake and paper thin
Played to anything that's televised
It's safe to say my ignorance stayed a bliss is why
I'll fade in tonight
'Cause she's so bright
'Cause she's so bright
This modern life is so boring
All is fair in love and war
It's for the best
As insatiable an appetite be put to rest
And she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I'm in paradise
Show me heart break a thousand times
I don't care to be or be caught without sweet misery by my side
Wide awake and paper thin
Played to anything that's televised
It's safe to say my ignorance stayed a bliss is why
I'll fade in tonight

'Cause she's so bright
She's so bright
'Cause she's so bright
She is so bright
