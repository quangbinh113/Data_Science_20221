Song Name: Daydream Baby
My baby left me sad and blue
On Honeymoon Avenue
Oh, my baby how could you?
Given all that you knew
My baby broke my porcelain heart
Dragged my spirit from the stars
My heartstrings were pulled apart
By my baby sweetheart
Daydream baby
Don't you love me?
Daydream baby
Stay here with me
My baby left me by the ocean
Abandoned my beloved emotions
Tossed aside my undying devotion
Kiss me goodbye in slow motion
Daydream baby
Don't you love me?
Daydream baby
Stay here with me
You said you would love me forever
You said you would never, never
Leave, leave, leave me
Leave, leave, leave me
My baby left me sad and blue
On Honeymoon Avenue
Oh, my baby how could you?
Given all that you knew
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Daydream baby
Don't you love me?
Daydream baby
Stay here with me
You said you would love me forever
You said you would never, never
Leave, leave, leave me
Leave, leave, leave me
