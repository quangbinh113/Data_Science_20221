Song Name: Airplane Mode
I need to not pick up my phone
I'll go straight to airplane mode
Find something to do alone
I can be a little bit cold
But my third eye is going blind
I'm unaligned with my body and mind
It's playing tricks, I say I'm fine
But really, it's hurting me deep inside
'Cause I been dreaming about you, oooh
I've been wishing that I was next to you, oooh
I've been dreaming of us, oooh
I've been thinking that this is not a need or a must, but
Love has driving me so, so wrong
So you're all I've got to show our songs
And I want to be super duper true to you
But God, I don't know what to do
'Cause last year I was just 22, feels like it up and flew
So far away, and out of view, but 23 seems like me and you
'Cause I been dreaming about you, oooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, oooh
I've been dreaming of us, oooh
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must
I've been dreaming of us
I've know sometimes I make you feel insane
Sorry that's just how I play this stupid game
I've can't act like a child and disobey
All that you want from me and that you say
I'm sorry baby, please puppy
I'm trying to be ultra mega happy
And show you my smile, and send you my feelings
And fuck, it is so hard being so damn far
I've guess I'll just stay here and stay singing in my car
Singing in my car
'Cause I been dreaming about you, oooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, oooh
I've been dreaming of us, oooh
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must, but
I've been waiting on you, oooh
I've been waiting for you to tell me those three words too
'Cause I been hoping it's true
That one day I'll feel like I'm something new for you
I've been dreaming of us, oooh
