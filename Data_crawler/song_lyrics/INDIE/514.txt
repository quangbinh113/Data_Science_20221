Song Name: Steve
I know the Bible isn't perfect
'Cause it left one person out
There was Adam, there was Eve
And there was someone else around
Yeah I think his name was Steve
And he was passing through town
When he heard a snake whispering
To Adam in the garden
"Take the fruit, it's good for you"
Steve said "I beg your pardon
I know it's not my business
But will you just hear me out"
He said "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows
From a forbidden seed
Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve and there was Steve
He said "Adam, don't be a fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste"
Oh what a waste
To have everything and give it all away
Adam looked around and as he wrestled with his fate
Steve and Eve rolled up their sleeves
To wrestle with that snake
In the midst of all the chaos
Steve was still screaming out
He said "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows
From a forbidden seed
Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve, and there was Steve
He said "Adam, don't be a fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste"
Oh what a waste
To have everything and give it all away
Sometimes I feel like Adam
'Cause I've got more than I need
But even when I have it all
I want what's out of reach
Maybe I should learn my lesson
Like Steve was talking to me
He said "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows
From a forbidden seed
Oh you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve, and there was Steve
He said "Adam, don't be a fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste"
Oh what a waste
To have everything and give it all away
