Song Name: And I Love Her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
A love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Hold you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
