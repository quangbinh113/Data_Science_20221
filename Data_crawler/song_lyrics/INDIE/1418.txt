Song Name: Serotonin
I'm running low on serotonin
Chemical imbalance got me twisting things
Stabilize with medicine
There's no depth to these feelings
Dig deep, can't hide from the corners of my mind
I'm terrified of what's inside
I get intrusive thoughts like cutting my hands off
Like jumping in front of a bus
Like how do I make this stop
When it feels like my therapist hates me? (Are you ready to me see me now?)
Please don't let me go crazy (yeah)
Put me in a field with daisies
Might not work, but I'll take a maybe
Oh, been breaking daily
But only me can save me
So I'm capitulating, crying like a fucking baby
I don't wanna miss-, I don't wanna be-
I don't wanna-
I'm running low on serotonin
Chemical imbalance got me twisting things
Stabilize with medicine
But there's no depth to these feelings
Dig deep, can't hide from the corners of my mind
I'm terrified of what's inside
I get intrusive thoughts like burning my hair off
Like hurting somebody I love
Like, does it ever really stop?
When there's control, I lose it (are you ready to see me now?)
Incredibly impulsive (yeah)
So scared I'm gonna end up doing something stupid
But I try to contain it
Ah, it gets so draining
It's like my heart is failing
Every night, I'm contemplating
My inner voice is saying "tough"
So I try to brush it off
Yeah, I try to brush it off
I'm running low on serotonin
Chemical imbalance got me twisting things
Stabilize with medicine
But there's no depth to these feelings
Dig deep, can't hide from the corners of my mind
I'm terrified of what's inside
Kan man egentlig, kan man kjenne i hjertet at det liksom har blodpropp?
Jeg følte liksom at hjertet mitt slutta å slå at, sånn at
Liksom at jeg følte at jeg ble litt sånn tung og rar i kroppen
