Song Name: Call Me
Colour me your colour, baby
Colour me your car
Colour me your colour, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your colour chart
I know where you're coming from
Call me (Call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (Call me) I'll arrive
You can call me any day or night
Call me
Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi
Call me (Call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (Call me) I'll arrive
When you're ready, we can share the wine
Call me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
He speaks the languages of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Amore, chiamami, chiamami
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Appelle-moi mon cheri, appelle-moi
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any way
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day, any way
Call me (Call me) my love
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (Call me) for a ride
Call me, call me for some overtime
Call me (Call me) my love
Call me, call me in a sweet design
Call me (Call me)
Call me for your lover's, lover's alibi
