Song Name: Boy Bi
So, do you like girls or do you like boys? (Ha, ahh, ha, ahh)
Oh, um, I mean, uhh, yes?
When my friends ask me 'bout my sexuality
I choke up and joke that the answer's not easy
Like, I'm watchin' a Disney movie and the couple gets it on
But who should I look at, is it Shang or Mulan?
I like boys and girls but I still don't know why
I couldn't get either one if I really try
I'm switchin' my preference like an on-and-off switch
If I had a dime for every crush I've had I'd be rich
Like boy bye, girl hi
New guy, I'm bi?
I cry every time
I try-y to decide
I guess you're right, I'm bi just without the "sexual" (aah)
I'm too scared to date so I've just been bi myself (aah)
Like, I'm watchin' a Disney movie and I slowly start to sweat (aah)
Is it Jasmine's dancing or Aladdin's open vest?
Oh, it sucks sometimes to be right in the in between
I'm too gay for girls, too straight to be a drag queen
I'm just playin', I'm just sayin', I'd like to be clear
I don't know what the hell is goin' on here

And love can be hard
For someone who doesn't know what they wa-ant
I'm missin' a part
For all of my life got a hole in my heart
And love could be a winning game (aah, aah)
To those who are straight, but (aah, aah)
I'm perfectly complete-ete-ete-ete... (aah)

(One, two, three)
Like boy bye (boy bye), girl hi (girl hi)
New guy (new guy), I'm bi? (I'm bi?)
I cry (I cry) every time (every time)
I try to decide-e
