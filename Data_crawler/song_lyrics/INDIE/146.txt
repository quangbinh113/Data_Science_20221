Song Name: nobody's home
Woah
Nobody's home
I'm all alone
Guess I'll just sit here and stare at my phone
When I'm all alone
You don't even know
How bad i'd love to be alone with you
And I could go put on a hoodie and sweats
And then take a walk to coffee
And get back into bed
But my bed
And my head
And the heart
That you wrecked
In my chest
Are a mess
Since the second you left
And I'm lying awake
And impatiently pacing
The hallways
And taking the pictures from frames
And arrangements of dasies
In vases you made
Are all dead and alone
Like I am but I hope that
Maybe I'll forget you someday
But today is just another Monday
So
Nobody's home
I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own
I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room
(In my room)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you
And i were king and queen of quiet nights in
We'd order food and watch a movie
And then do it again
But now the castle that we built
Is just a spot we split rent
And now it's slowly sinking in
That I don't have many friends
But when I sleep at night
I dream that we is you and
And when I wake i'm paralyzed
The bed is frozen on your side
Been sleeping sideways
Inside for 5 days
Been asking my brain
Who's waking up at your place
I hope I forgive you someday
But today is just another Monday
So
Nobody's home
I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own
I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room
(In my room)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you
You
You
I'd love to be alone with you
With you
With you
I'd love to be alone with
I know that I've got a couple of voids I could fill
I promise you one day I will
But if I can avoid them now
Lord knows I will
Maybe i'll forget you someday
Hey baby maybe one day
Or maybe after Sunday
When
Nobody's home
I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own
I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room
(In my room)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you
All that i know is I'd love to be alone with you
I've been going crazy patient
Waiting baby when you coming thru?
I'd love to be alone with you
