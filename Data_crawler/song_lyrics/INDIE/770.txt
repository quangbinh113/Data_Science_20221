Song Name: GO TO HELL
Waking up in the morning's hard
I miss you even though it don't make sense
It's hurting in my chest to breathe
When all I see are stories of our love
So hard, but it was not enough
I'm going out to a party
And the only thing they're asking's how you are
Saying I'm okay, but really I'm crying
And my head is so fucked from what you did
I'm getting drunk
Tell me, tell me
When did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell?
I'm trying hard to hate you
But I can't stop loving who I thought you were
Was it ever real or were your lips just stained from him
Don't call me honey, you're the best and worst of all
So tell me, tell me
When did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell?
This is my loving last farewell
I hope you both go rot in hell
This is my loving last farewell
I hope you both go rot in hell
When did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Tell me, tell me
When did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell?
