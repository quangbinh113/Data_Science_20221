Song Name: Another One of Those Days
Cycling down town
Thought the fresh air would pick me up
Up up and away from the ground
But there's no talking dog up here
Blowing up balloons with my dear
Hoped maybe I'd see a familiar face on my way
Passed by some cannabis seeds
It all smells exactly the same
I saw a girl in my dreams
But I don't remember her name
I guess it's just another one of those days
When I'm missing everything
Carousel round and round
Like a kid's toy you wind me up
And I've got nothing to say
So you just throw me in the dump truck
Hoping round the corner I'll see her
Passed that kid from chemistry
Who made fun of my name
He didn't look very happy
I guess we all turn out the same
I saw a girl in my dreams
She kissed me on the face
I guess it's just another one of those days
When I'm missing everything
When she shows up she can sit on my shoulders
'Cause I'm so strong, I wish

Piggy back ride to the hill then we roll down
Feeling like kids for the rest of our lives
Hoping in the morning I'll meet her
But for now I'll just be lonely
And my arms will feel so bare
Dreaming 'bout her body round me
With my fingers in her hair
It might be so easy but I am just too scared
'Cause I saw a girl in my dreams
But she doesn't like me
I saw a girl in my dreams
