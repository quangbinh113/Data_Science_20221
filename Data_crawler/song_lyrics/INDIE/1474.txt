Song Name: Lua
I know that it is freezing
But I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
When everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and a paper
Have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening
By the morning looks like shit
And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening
By the morning won't exist
You're looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Always say you'll be right back
Well, it takes one to know one, kid
I think you got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning's such a drag
I got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane
And I'm not sure what the trouble was
That started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is
It was so simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
