Song Name: Angels
Angels
Watching over me, I have a halo
Faithful
Always to the ones who I would pray for
Close to my heart
Angels call me back home
Warm within my arms
I feel I'm coming back home
Pesos
Now and then you don't get what you pay for
Things flow
Back to where they're from
Where I'm supposed to go
Angels
Watching over me, I have a halo
Faithful
Always to the ones who I would pray for
Close to my heart
Angels call me back home
Warm within my arms
I feel I'm coming back home
Faithful
Always to the ones who I would pray for
Close to my heart
Angels call me back home
Warm within my arms
I feel I'm coming back home
