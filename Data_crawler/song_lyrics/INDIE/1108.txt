Song Name: Ain't Shit
Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
You can say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing
Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag
But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doing too much, relax a bit
Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Should've known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin)
Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
