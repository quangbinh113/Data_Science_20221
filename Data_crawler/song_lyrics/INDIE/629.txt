Song Name: Sight Of Your Soul
Insomnia keeps me up at night
I sleep on the wrong side
From what I've seen
You're quite the wandering kind
How long have you known
I've had my eyes on you
Seen you in these halls
Darling break down the walls!
Insomnia keeps me up at night
I sleep on the wrong side
From what I've seen
You're quite the wandering kind
How long have you known
I've had my eyes on you
Seen you in these halls
Darling break down the walls!
And unlike tonight I wanna see you come alive
I promise I won't be frightened by the sight of your soul
And unlike tonight I wanna see you come alive
I promise I won't be frightened by the sight of your soul
And unlike tonight I wanna see you come alive
I promise I won't be frightened by the sight of your soul
