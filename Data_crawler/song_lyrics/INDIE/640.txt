Song Name: Deal With It (feat. Kelis)
I don't need a man, I need a puppy
Allergic to you, every time you touch me
Emotional maturity for dummies
I don't have the time to pretend you're funny
I'm back and I'm better
I put that teddy bear you gave me in a blender
I drew a dick on all your sweatshirts
I hate you so much right now!
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Ahhhh!
I don't need a man, I need a rabbit
I need a new toy just to cleanse my palate
Big bad bitch, I'm the baddest
We both know it wasn't love, it was just a big bad habit
Stringing you along like a puppet
I can see the desperation, got you right where I want ya
Beg for it, plead, you can suck it
I hate you so much right now!
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Ahhhhh!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
Find me in the ball gown
With a champagne glass
With a man on my arm
I don't care what his name is
I've really levelled up now
I got jets on my back
Everything I do outrageous
You text me that you miss me
I say, "Who the fuck is this?" I deleted your number
Oops, oh gee, that's a bummer
I hate you so much right now!
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Deal with it
Boy, you got to
I don't want you
Do what you want
But just deal with it
'Cause I'm so over you
Ahhhhh!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
Aah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now!
