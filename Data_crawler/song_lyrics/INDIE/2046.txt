Song Name: Marvelous
(Mind the closing door, stand clear)
Wish that things could be simple as they used to be
Wanna take you for a ride, you'll lay back the seat
There won't be a need to be formal, past the point of cordial
We know that we could be anything we wanna be
Mind the gap to jump in the hole, I can't get this done on my own
Build a wall to go crash into, I just wanna do right by you
Think your patience is wearing off, if you go, you'll know I'll be lost
Have a marvelous time, I won't get you off of my mind
I know I need to see it, doesn't have to do with me
When there's spells you can't control, I'll try therapy
But it's hard to talk without guidance, fuck this sitting in silence
Kill the suspense, attractiveness is confidence
Mind the gap to jump in the hole, I can't get this done on my own
Build a wall to go crash into, I just wanna do right by you
Think your patience is wearing off, if you go, you'll know I'll be lost
Have a marvelous time, I won't get you off of my mind

Wish that things could be simple as they used to be
Wanna take you for a ride, you'll lay back the seat
Tell me if you start to get tired, what's left to be desired
When you look at me, is there something left to the (hmm)
Mind the gap to jump in the hole, I can't get this done on my own
Build a wall to go crash into, I just wanna do right by you
Think your patience is wearing off, if you go, you'll know I'll be lost
Have a marvelous time, I won't get you off of my, get you off my-
Mind the gap to jump in the hole, I can't get this done on my own
Build a wall to go crash into, I just wanna do right by you
Think your patience is wearing off, if you go, you'll know I'll be lost
Have a marvelous time, I won't get you off of my mind
