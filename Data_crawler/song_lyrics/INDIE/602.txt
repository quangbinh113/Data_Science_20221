Song Name: SLIDE
Girl, I've been patient
But we both know I hate waitin'
You just got to treat it like it's bowlin', baby
Drop a pin at your location
Straight to the head you love your liquor
Feelings and alcohol's a mixer
Ride me like a Maserati
Ride me like a Maserati
Yeah, goddamn, two girls one me, amen
Ay, let's dance, back it up, back it up, no hands
Shawty wanna slide to the crib
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
VVS diamonds on your wrist
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
There's somethin' 'bout the way you move your hip
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
Shawty wanna slide to the crib
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
She ain't even from around here
E'rybody love me out here
If you ain't gettin' money 'round here
Shut the fuck up, why you talkin' like a dummy out here?
It's goin' down
I just wanna drink a little 'til I'm unconscious
Swervin' in the whip and we don't care 'bout what the cop says
Runnin' thru the city, got Balenci on my wallet
Yeah, goddamn, two girls one me, amen
Ay, let's dance, back it up, back it up, no hands
Shawty wanna slide to the crib
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
VVS diamonds on your wrist
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
There's somethin' 'bout the way you move your hip
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
Shawty wanna slide to the crib
Tell shawty slide late-late-6 now
Slide baby, slide
Ay, back it up now
Down to slide with me, ay, ay
