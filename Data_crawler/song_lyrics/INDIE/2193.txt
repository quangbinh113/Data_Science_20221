Song Name: Lean Into Life
One night, I had a thought
What if we all did anything we want?
We quit our jobs, we went outside
No one could tell us how to live our lives
One night, I took a drug
I gave 300 uninvited hugs
You went to bed, I hit the floor
I don't think that we should get together anymore

One night, came and went
Spent lots of money, it was money well spent
I took on some credit card, credit card debt
On a night that didn't mean nothing, a night I'll probably forget
One night, I had a feeling
Bust through a wall, cut through the ceiling
27 Club and I'm still fucking breathing
I'm hyperventilating in a building full of people
It's beginning to feel like I've
Been training my whole life for nothing
I've been meaning to tell you something
You gotta lean into life, just a little
I think I'm breaking my own heart
I think I'm making my own self sick at the thought of getting sick
I don't leave anymore
Did I leave my keys in the door? It was so peaceful before
Come on, buddy
You gotta lean into life a bit
You gotta callous up them hands and get some dirt under them fingertips
I, ah, don't think it's skin and papier-mâché ornaments
Another Christmas Eve and you're still bumming out about the same shit
Come on my friend, yeah you're really going through it
You got all this free time, no fucking idea what to do with it
Sounds an awful lot like to me you like talking about your bootstraps
Go to hell, I am the devil tryna claw my way to heaven
I am regretful
We had our weekend filled with cocaine and Essentia
It was fun and now I can't really remember
And yet we wonder why we can't reach our potential
I am regretful
Yeah, my head is in the gutter
Do we really need to sin to love each other
Another psycho, I'll get fucked up then recover
I just want to be a better older brother
My head is in the gutter
It's beginning to feel like I've
Been training my whole life for nothing
I've been meaning to tell you something
You gotta lean into life, just a little
I think I'm breaking my own heart
I think I'm making my own self sick at the thought of getting sick
I don't leave any more
Did I leave my keys in the door? It was so peaceful before
