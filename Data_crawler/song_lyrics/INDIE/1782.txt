Song Name: Day By Day
Tell me something sweet
Maybe just a dream
I thought of you and me
Something you might keep all tucked away inside
You don't have to hide away from me
It's okay to tell me what you need
Say just what you like
I'll be waiting patiently 'cause
We can take it day by day
I just wanna get to know you, girl, in every way
Tell me that you wanna take it slow and that's okay
Day by day with you
(Day by day, day by day, take it)
Baby, let me prove my love is real (day by day)
I know you can feel my heart
Come a little closer, you can steal
Every little word I say
Like heaven's just a touch away
Oh, I can see all of the colors and chemistry
The way we mesh into each other, the synergy
It's unmatched, I know you've been hurt in the past
But the pain don't have to last (oh)
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know, oh
Where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go
We can take it day by day
I just wanna get to know you, girl, in every way
Tell me that you wanna take it slow and that's okay
Day by day with you
(Day by day, day by day, take it)
(Day by day, day by day)
We can take it day by day (I wanna take it day by day)
I just wanna get to know you, girl, in every way (I wanna know you every way)
Tell me that you wanna take it slow and that's okay (and that's okay, that's okay)
Day by day with you
Day by day, day by day, take it (day by day)
Day by day, day by day
I'll take it day by day
Oh, woah-oh (won't you take your time?)
Oh, woah-oh (baby that's okay, if you feel fine)
Day by day
Oh, woah-oh (day by day, oh)
Oh, woah-oh (day by day, day by day, take it)
Day by day
Day by day
