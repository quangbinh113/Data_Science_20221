Song Name: always, i'll care
Driving down the interstate
I never felt so far away
Leaving hardly hurts at all
I'm sorry that I never call
Often, I get exhausted
Trying regardless to be enough
Is it selfish not to be selfless
When all I can help is to open up?
I'll be better than I was before
Despite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still?
Just to hear my voice, I swear
Always, I'll care
(I'll care)
Flipping through our photographs
Those moments never seem to last
Listening to self control
There's feelings that you'll never know
Leave me, it's never easy
I've had a lifetime to be alone
If you let me
When it gets heavy
No, I'll never let you be all alone
I'll be better than I was before
Despite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still?
Just to hear my voice, I swear
Always
Always
Always, I'll care
Always
