Song Name: at least i'm pretty
I quit smokin', but that's a lie
'Cause I had a cigarette or two last night
I saw my therapist today, we talked about you all the way
Through the session, guess I learned my lesson
And it's a clean cut down the line
It's a hard life when it's mine
Drove around this whole city, at least, my mom thinks I'm pretty
But you want nothing to do with me
At least, I'm pretty
(He's in a relationship with his guitar)
I'm not the brightest, I can barely focus
Mmm, but I bet you didn't notice
We used to ride in your car, I always knew who you are
But now I drive all alone, I should've known this
And it's a clean cut down the line
It's a hard life when it's mine
Drove around this whole city, at least, my mom thinks I'm pretty
But you want nothing to do with me
At least, I'm pretty
