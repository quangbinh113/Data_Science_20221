Song Name: whore
They call you a harlot
They call you a whore and I don't mind it
I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've done
We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before
You don't need a miracle
This is a miracle
You're driving but you're lost
You dont know what you want
We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before
You don't need a miracle
You are a miracle
You're driving but you're lost
You don't know what you want
(We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before)
