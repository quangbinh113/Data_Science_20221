Song Name: Silence Overgrown
Take me, I don't mind
Said it's this one that wastes my time
Did they see that, can they feel it too
It's not this one that I'm used to
When I wake up at my favourite brink
It's not this one that I will think about too much
Can they feel it too
It's not this one that's better than you
Just better for me than
Don't be long
I don't belong at all
Silence overgrown, yea that is where I live
And where I live alone
When there's no ice what is it I break
See I talk to myself, but don't know what to say
And when I check in at my favourite brink
It's not this one that I will think about too much
What is it I break
Well usually that depends on the day
And who's in my way
Don't be long
I don't belong at all
Take me, I don't mind
Said it's this one that wastes my time
Did you see that, can you feel it too
What I'm used to is the silence when it's overgrown
Yea that is where I live and where I live a lonely life
No ice, what is it I break
Depends on the day and who's in my way
And when I wake up at my favourite brink
It's not this one that I will think about too much
Can they feel it too
No better than you
Just better for me than you
