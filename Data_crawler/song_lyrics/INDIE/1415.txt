Song Name: Frankie
Born with emotion

Pushed into motion
Wichita Lineman
Our most favorite tragedy
Yeah

Don't go leave
Work your speed
What an honor, what a breed
Keep looking up
Just up enough
Past temporary prairie
Wait for the break when we get some rain
Swim in the creeks that the New Deal laid
Can't break even, but can't complain
Pushed right back to try it again
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Born with devotion
Pushed into motion, God, don't stop
Making it harder
All the time
Just wanna move to Virginia
Get a dog and a house with a human name
Call me Linda Tomorrow
Give me something to dance to in 6/8
Wait for the break when we get some rain
Under the lights of the TVA
Can't break even, but can't complain
Pushed right back to try it again
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Wait for the break when we get some rain
Swim in the creeks that the New Deal laid
Can't break even, but can't complain
Pushed right back to try it again
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) they get you to give it up
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) they want you to give it up
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) they get you to give it up
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) they want you...
