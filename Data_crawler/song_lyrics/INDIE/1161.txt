Song Name: Like A Fool
We take a chance from time to time
And put our necks out on the line

And you have broken every promise that we made
And I have loved you anyway
Took a fine time to leave me hangin' out to dry
Understand now I'm greivin' so don't you waste my time
'Cause you have taken all the wind out from my sails
And I have loved you just the same
We finally find this then you're gone
Been chasin' rainbows all along
And you have cursed me when there's no one left to blame
And I have loved you just the same
And you have broken every single fuckin' rule
And I have loved you like a fool
