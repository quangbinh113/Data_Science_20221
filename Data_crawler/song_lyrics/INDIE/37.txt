Song Name: cliché
I walked into the room and then I saw your face
You looked me in the eye
And then I wanted to erase myself
Erase myself
I didn't wanna fall but then I stepped right in
I looked down at the ground
And then I felt it right within
It was too late for me (too late for her)
You took a step forward and tilted your head
With a curious glance you stared
And I felt dead
Oh my god, I think I'm dying!
You said "Hey"
And I said "Hello"
"What's your name?
I'd really like to know about you..."
Too bad I stopped at hello
I just stared
And you grinned
And looked right back
It felt like just one big whirlwind
One big emotional whirlwind
Over the next few days we got to talking
With every single word I started falling farther
Farther and farther for you
You were so witty and so charming
You swept me off my feet
You made me laugh, you made me blush
No one could compete (no one could compete)
It seemed to good to be true (it was too good to be true)
I wanted to be with you (and only with you)
We clicked like legos
Or the clacking of tap shoes
You said "Hey"
I said "Hello
How was your day?"
You said "Better now" with a smile
Oh what a cliché
But to be honest it made my day
I didn't wanna fall but then I stepped right in
I looked up at your face
And those eyes, they drew me in
It was too late for me
And that's what we were
A simple cliché
It wasn't made to work
But i wouldn't have it any other way (any other way)
You were so witty and so charming
You swept me off my feet
You made me laugh, you made me blush
Oh no one could compete (no one could compete)
It seemed to good to be true (it was too good to be true)
I wanted to be with you (and only with you)
We clicked like legos
Or the clacking of tap shoes
You said "Hey"
I said "Hello
I gotta know, do you feel this way?"
You said "Yeah i do, but i was scared of what you might say"
And that's all we were
A silly cliché
I still think you're cute
But maybe it's better this way
That's okay
We're just a little cliché
A little cliché
But that's okay
