Song Name: The Valley of The Pagans (feat. Beck)
Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are all feelin' so good
From a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go
It feels so good to have a perfect soul
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect soul
It feels so good to be in total control
There were spotlights flying through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The beasts hiding in the clouds, no future, bad man
Nothing for Christmas, not very likely
One hundred million Viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse, in a valley
It feels so good to have a perfect soul (uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh-huh)
It feels so good to have a perfect soul (uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh-huh)
It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright
Alright all night, alright, alright, alright
Say sweet dreams, et cetera and forever
I hope, said no one
She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a haemophiliac
With a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and schadenfreude eyes
Thinkin' airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind
It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day
It's time to party
It's time to party (woo)
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors
Oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a pagan
You can feel like a pagan
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors
Oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a pagan
You can feel like a pagan
In the valley (yeah)
In the valley (I live in the valley now)
In the valley (I heard there's a shaman out in the desert)
In the valley (I'm getting really transcendental, and liking it)
Feel like a pagan now (I'm on a cleanse)
Feel like a pagan
In the valley (well the hot tub is really chill)
Feel like a pagan
