Song Name: insane
I drink my coffee in the morning
I brush my teeth before bed
I fake a smile to keep the sad thoughts
Out of my head
I sit outside and watch the world spin
I bet you probably moved on
But I still can't seem to sing
Hmm, anything but this song
I've asked my therapist
My mom and dad the same
I've asked my friends and fam
They all say I'm to blame
I've spent all this time pretending I'm okay
Well, I'm not okay
Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day
The day I go insane
It'll probably be the best day in my life
I'll be rid of all my problems
I'll be rid of my strife
And I can't even fix an issue
'By just sayin' good night
And I don't even got to worry if
I'm wrong or I'm right
And when I argue with my darkest side
It's comin' to light
I'd rather have 'em call me crazy
Than have another fight with you
This mind of mine is mine to lose, it's true
I've asked my therapist
My mom and dad the same
I've asked my friends and fam
They all say I'm to blame
I've been spending all this time
Pretending I'm okay
Well, I'm not okay
Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day
If today's the day I go insane
Please tell my mom and dad I'm not in pain
And tell my sister not to do the same
It's just, these lonely days get lonelier with rain
And then the feelings come
And go and pass in waves (pass in waves)
And I can feel myself start to
Get swept away (swept away)
I guess if your heart can break
Then your head can do the same (do the same)
It's hard to explain
Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day
The day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)
The day I go insane (Today, I'll go insane)
The day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)
That'll be the day, today might be the day
(Today, I'll go insane)
The day I go insane
Yeah, it hurts, but it's true
I shouldn't care, but I do
I hide who I'm inside
Like I've got something to prove
But what I've learned is that pretending
Ends up bad for my health
What's the point of being if
I'm not being myself?
