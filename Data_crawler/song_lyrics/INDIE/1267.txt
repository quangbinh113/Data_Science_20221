Song Name: Photo ID
New week, no sleep, no key
I lost 'em in the street
And, no, I can't see without you
Billy and Badu, I'll follow you into any room
'Cause I can't hear without you
(Shit gets weird when you talk about it)
Wait in line, smile for the photo ID
Inside, that's where we can be free
Your highness, caught you sippin' on lean
Reminds me that's how it's supposed to be
Bitch, you fell asleep too fast
I want my money back
But I can't deal without you
Now I'm stuck behind your beat
I kick my feet up
You're so mean
But I can't dream without you
(Shit gets weird when you talk about it)
Wait in line, smile for the photo ID
Inside, that's where we can be free
Your highness, caught you sippin' on lean
Reminds me that's how it's supposed to be
Ooh, baby, turn off the light
You're gonna make my body fry
Ooh, baby, don't you cry
Shit gets weird when you talk about it
Ooh, baby, turn off the light
You're gonna make my body fry
Ooh, baby, don't you cry
Shit gets weird when you talk about
Wait in line, smile for the photo ID
Inside, that's where we can be free
Your highness, caught you sippin' on lean
Reminds me that's how it's supposed to be
Tellin' me things that I, that I, that I, that I
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna, didn't wanna
Tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
And if I see that girl around you, I'll be stepping on her toes
'Cause you been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
And if I see that girl around you, I'll be stepping on her toes (woo!)
Alright
Feel free
Okay
See that girl around you, I'll be stepping on her toes
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
And if I see that girl around you, I'll be steppin on her toes
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
And if I see that girl around you, I'll be steppin on her toes
You been tellin' me things that I didn't wanna know
And if I see that girl around you, I'll be steppin on her toes
Woo!
