Song Name: Sue Me
Remember when you said it
There's no second chance
Oh baby I heard you been hoping
You could change the past
You miss the long goodnights
You miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights
(Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Well did you ever think that it was hard for me?
To walk it off like nothing happened nonchalantly
I got you feeling like
I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like
(Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me (go!)
It's hard to see me on when you've been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see
What you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see
(Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself, can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me (oh)
I, I, I, I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me

Sue me, baby, hmm
