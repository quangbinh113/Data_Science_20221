Song Name: It Might Be Time
Something doesn't feel right
That's enough for one night
Hope ya'll get home alright
There I go, blamin' on the weather
But hey, there's nothing wrong
I'm only tired of all these voices
Always saying
Nothin' lasts forever
It might be time to face it

It ain't as fun as it used to be, no
You're goin' under
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You ain't as cool as you used to be, no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
I've been lost before
So tell me it's not over
'Cause I finally got something going, and suddenly
All my friends are growing up, and moving on
I must be missing something
'Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive for now

Don't they know?
Nothin' lasts forever
It might be time to face it

Nobody knows what you come here for
You're goin' under
They roll their eyes when you're at the door
It might be time

It might be time to face it
You may as well embrace it
We promise to come visit
It might be time
It might be time to face it

You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
