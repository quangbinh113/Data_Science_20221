Song Name: Atlantis
The birds have left the trees
The light bores onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get dark?
'Cause in my heart and in my head
I'll never take back the things I said
So high above
I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head"
"Tell me why this has to end"
Oh no, oh no
I can't save us
My Atlantis, we fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis, oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go
It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above
I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head"
"Tell me why this has to end"
Oh no, oh no
I can't save us
My Atlantis, we fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis, oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
And we've built it up
And we've built it up
And we've built it up to pull it down
And we've built it up
And we've built it up

And we've built it up to pull it down
I can't save us
My Atlantis, we fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis, oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
