Song Name: Shot Shot Cherry
Everyone is sitting waiting
Praying anticipating
For the mighty thunder to pass
Practice learn some languages
Fix me many sandwiches
Our affection's in the past
So shot shot cherry ooh ooh
What can we do about it
We gotta live without it
Shot shot cherry ooh ooh
The world's about to end
So drink up and pretend
Sick of being tired fired
Lonely undesired
Going back to where we started
Gotta wear my fancy clothes
Fed up with the online shows
We're worn & broken hearted
So shot shot cherry ooh ooh
What can we do about it
We gotta live without it
Shot shot cherry ooh ooh
The world's about to end
So drink up and pretend
So shot shot cherry ooh ooh
What can we do about it
We gotta live without it
Shot shot cherry ooh ooh
The world's about to end
So drink up and pretend
Shot shot cherry
Shot shot cherry
Shot shot cherry
Shot shot cherry
