Song Name: Lucky People
Light us up until we pop
I wanna burn bright until we're not
Let's keep each other safe from the world
I'll be your optimistic black hole
Full of love I can't control
Let's keep each other safe from the world
(From the world)
Happy Birthday
Merry Christmas
To the one I call my missus
I'm leaving you love notes in the kitchen
That say it all
I know you said to mind my business
But Cupid sent me on a mission
That's got me sitting, wishing
Waiting for your call
Let's be lucky people, you and me
My hourglass is in your hands
You've got my time, you are my plans
Let's keep each other safe from the world
You've got me writing sappy songs
I used to laugh at on my own
Let's keep each other safe from the world
'Cause I know it's hard to let yourself be fine
When we carry 'round our worried, flurried minds
But I'll let go if you do too
Happy Birthday
Merry Christmas
To the one I call my missus
I'm leaving you love notes in the kitchen
That say it all
I know you said to mind my business
But Cupid sent me on a mission
That's got me sitting, wishing
Waiting for your call
Let's be lucky people, you and me
My common sense is powerless
And I'm convinced that you have caught me
Luck is just the half of it
The better half of me that I couldn't quit
'Cause now I'm flying 'cross the country
More than monthly for you
You've got me more than clumsy
But you're my yellow, lovely
Happy Birthday
Merry Christmas
To the one I call my missus
I'm leaving you love notes in the kitchen
That say it all
I know you said to mind my business
But Cupid sent me on a mission
That's got me sitting, wishing
Waiting for your call
