Song Name: After The Earthquake
After the earthquake
Pictures hanging diagonally
Drive through crying in a milkshake
It wasn't built to last
Up in the front seat
You were playing with the station
And I was fidgeting with the heat
Looking back to the vibrant days of
Racket in the hall
Caution to the breeze
Say you'll climb your way out
Of your wake now
Velvet curtain drawn
Flowers at your feet
Say you'll contemplate how
You're weighed down
The pulse of the brake light
Is the colour of burning embers
If you wake up, will you remember
The awful things I said at the edge of the bed?
Thrashing like a great white (I feel the northern tide)
As they rolled you up on a stretcher (crashing on the pines)
And the faint words of Jessica Fletcher (I feel the northern tide)
Were drowned out by the sound of (crashing on the pines)
Racket in the hall
Caution to the breeze
Say you'll climb your way out
Of your wake now
Those days, I'd never let you fall apart
But things fade like the scent of a brand new car
Why would I ever fall in love again
When every detail is over the guard rail?
Say you'll climb your way out
Of your wake now
Say you'll contemplate how
You're weighed down
Are you awake now?
Are you awake now?
Racket in the hall
Caution to the breeze
Velvet curtain drawn
Flowers at your feet
