Song Name: Juliet
I need to cry, but I can't
Get anything out of my eyes or my head
Did I die?
I need to run, but I can't
Get out of bed for anyone
Not for you, ooh
My sour boy is a pain
I wanna shoot him in the brain
But I'd miss him in the morning
It really hurts
When I need to so bad, but I can't see her
My Juliet, my special girl
But I need to understand
When I can power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head
I wanna make
A colour that no one else has seen before
I wanna be so much more
I hope that she
Looks at me and thinks, "Shit, he is so pretty"
Something I can't believe
But I need to understand
When I can power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head
Sometimes I act like I know but I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes and a bully in his head
Sometimes I act like I know but I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes and a bully in his head
