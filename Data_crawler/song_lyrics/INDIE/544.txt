Song Name: THE QUIET
Growing distance
Free of explanation
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplation
I'd rather be spitting blood
Than have this silence fuck me up
The separation
Time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew
Ah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Used to give each other the world
Every bit
I used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust
And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
And feel myself turn to stone
Ah, just tell me
Say anything

Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
I don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to find
Anything but quiet
Just tell me
Say anything

Anything hurts less than the quiet
Anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
Any-anything
