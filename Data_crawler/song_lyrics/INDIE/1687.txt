Song Name: Would You Mind
Say hello
Don't know why but I always get too shy
Every time
You are around
Tonight
I could pack all my love
Send it like the wind blows
You know
If I could fly
I'd fly to your window
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Tonight
I could pack all my love
Send it like the wind blows
You know
If I could fly
I'd fly to your window
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
