Song Name: Silver and Blue
I should've held your hand and danced in the pouring rain
I wish I had another chance, but I fear it's too late
For me to be the symphony that sweeps you off your feet
Didn't know that I was holding gold
Now you've found another melody
But darling can you hear me?
Silver and Blue
I'm a tide with no moon
And I'm so lost without you
Silver and Blue I'm a tide with no moon
And I'm so lost without you
I don't know where to go without you
I should have known to hold you close every time of the day
But like shooting stars I was so far away
Thought I needed to be free but now I'm just alone in the Milky Way
But if gravity had sympathy it would pull you back to my embrace
So darling come back to me
Silver and Blue
I'm a tide with no moon
And I'm so lost without you
Silver and Blue I'm a tide with no moon
And I'm so lost without you
I don't know where to go without you
I didn't think I'd have to sink so deep to finally see
How much I need your love to breathe
But if I saw you shining I would flow right back to you
Silver and Blue
I'm a tide with no moon
And I'm so lost without you
I don't know where to go without you
