Song Name: You and Me
Slow down
Take it easy
Nothing but road
For me and my
In my dreams
I cannot describe
Cause baby it ain't nothing but you and me
We'll walk along the beachside
We'll feel that tide wind blow
She sips a cola
In my dreams I cannot describe
In my dreams I cannot describe
Cause baby it ain't nothing but you and me
Cause baby it ain't nothing but you and me
