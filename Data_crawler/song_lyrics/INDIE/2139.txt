Song Name: Tonight (feat. Ezra Koenig)
Could you, could you come tonight?
Instead of goin' under
Could you, could you come tonight?
Would you think it'd be her last December?
Could it be the way she combs her hair?
It must have been the day you lost to care
What if I was the answer to your prayer?
Yeah, you need a little candor, need a little candor
What if we last 'til it's dawn like you promised me?
Who let the boys spill their entrée?
Dinner is served, can't you see we're not opposites?
Are you still up thinkin' of me?
I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it's all the same
I've played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprisin'
Roll with me
Let's roll
Could you, could you come tonight?
I'm countin' from the thunder
Could you, could you come tonight?
I got a feelin' that you know the number
Could I be the best to jump ahead?
Your feet are hurtin' less with moccasins
I never heard another comment since
You need a little splendor, need a little splendor
What if we last 'til it's dawn like you promised me?
Who let the boys spill their entrée?
Dinner is served, can't you see we're not opposites?
Are you still up thinkin' of me?
I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it's all the same
I've played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprisin'
Roll with me
Let's roll with me
I talk to myself and it's quite surprisin'
In the middle of the night (night, night, night)
Roll
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprising
In the middle of a fight (fight, fight, fight)
Roll
Can't you see the sign up on the wall?
In the middle of the night (night, night)
Roll
Can't you see the sign up on the wall?
In the middle of a fight (fight)
I talk to myself and it's quite surprisin'
Roll with me
Let's roll with me
I wish I could be someone like you
Wish I could be someone else, someone like you
Wish I could be someone else, someone like you
Be someone else, someone else, someone like you
Wish I could be someone else, someone like you
Be someone else, someone else, someone like you
