Song Name: What We Left Behind
Throw me into the shade
I need to slow down
I'm afraid I've wasted the day
So I'll bury my head somehow
Watch me spinning around
Stuck on the detail
Suddenly finding it hard
I just want someone to pay my bills
Little bird, sing to me in an ever-changing world
And another flower calling us to open up our eyes
Then we will realize what we left behind
We left behind
Running out of control
And colour blinds me
Anybody turning away?
I haven't decided yet
Looking on from afar
Picture the season
Do you even know who you are?
Or are you sleeping?
Little bird, sing to me in an ever-changing world
And another flower begging us to open up our eyes
When will we realize what we left behind
We left behind
