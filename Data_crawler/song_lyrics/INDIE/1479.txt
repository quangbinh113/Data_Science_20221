Song Name: Dog Has Its Day
I just called to say I can't stand losing out on you
Wrap my head around the plan
Count the things I lose
Cause I don't want to share
I don't want to share you
Hold the bottle in my hand
Hole I fall into
Gun it down and feel like calling again
But you're on somebody new
I don't want to care
I don't want to care but I do
It's not a reaction to the fall of your hair
The pitch of your laugh in the photo in a frame by my bed
Not every night that we lay instead
Of making time
I don't care to say
The dog has it's day in the end
