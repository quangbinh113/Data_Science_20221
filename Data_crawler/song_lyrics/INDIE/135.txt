Song Name: seasonal depression
I just don't see a whole lot of sun
And lately I just can't seem to have any fun
I look outside my window
It's so dark, I feel my eyes begin to close
Seasonal depression's
Got me sleeping off the days
And I've wasted all my time feeling grey
When the sun peeks out I sit outside
To bask in my tiny bit of the light
To warm, the cold that I feel inside
I'm locked up in here
With the rain coming down
Trying to fool myself
To lift up my frown
But a cup of tea and a nap
Don't solve my problems
I don't like LA
'Cept for tacos and Venice
But god, I would move
Get some rays and play tennis
And tell my lyft driver
To turn up the volume
Seasonal depression's
Got me sleeping off the days
And I've wasted all my time feeling grey
When the sun peeks out I sit outside
To bask in my tiny bit of the light
To warm, the cold that I feel inside
We're all just trying to get by
Searching desperately for bits of blue in the sky
Sometimes it's hard to wake on up
It takes more than loads of coffee in your cup
'Cause seasonal depression's
Got us sleeping off the days
And we've wasted all our time feeling grey
When the sun peeks out we sit outside
To bask in our tiny bit of the light
To warm, the cold that we feel inside
