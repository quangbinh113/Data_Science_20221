Song Name: Golden Rope
Yeah
Sick and tired what a kid life be
Sinking on the floor, how could this be me?
I'm a winner
I'm a winner
Snow and death, part of being lonely
Shit like this won't ever be clean
Like vanilla
Like vanilla
Miracle city full of radar beeps
Mary goes 'round 'til the day she leaps
I'ma kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em
I'm barking on the seat, need to go out
This bitch can't find a lucky Lola
Riding for the money, need a whole lot
Momma called, wishing I would call her
Fuck nights like this, I want more life
Walking down the city with Nikolai
Park me on a bench like a donut
Rise life for me, I'm the core light, sing
Why did no one save-
Why did no one save these souls? Hey
Money made machines hanging by a golden rope, hey
Twenty thousand bones and a honeysuckle rose I'd pay
But she still won't say, "I love you"
I-I-I-I, I love you
Na-na, na-na
Melanchol in a crocodile
Slumped by the river, trying to make him smile
I miss the rhythm
Mass graves from the '45s
Slow bullets follow many mortal lives
Am I a riddle?
Now catch me if you can, like a homer
Pack my bags, Bora Bora
Book a villa
And so I finally kissed her fist goodbye
Look up from the wheel, see her face in the sky
Looking bitter, looking bitter, yeah-yeah
Why did no one save-
Why did no one safe these hoes? Hey
Money made machines hanging by a golden rope, ayy
Twenty thousand bones and a honeysuckle rose I'd pay
But she still won't say, "I love you"
I-I-I-I, I love you
I-I-I-I
Ooh-ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
One time for your mind
Yeah-yeah, ride, I got to ride
You know I got this beat
Ooh-ooh
Ride V6, ride-ride
Ride V6, ride-ride
