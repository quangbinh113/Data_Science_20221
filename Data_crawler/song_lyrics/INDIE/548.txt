Song Name: LEMONS - Demo
There's a billion on this planet that you could bother
But you for some reason chose me
I wish I give you the attention that you ordered
But I just don't have the energy
And maybe I'm the one that's being overdramatic
But I don't think so
I do know for fact though, that you're a definite coward
And I think I might be time for you to go
You're a sour little boy
With a fragile masculinity
You saw me as your toy
Now that I'm not, you abuse me
You're a sour little boy
Absolutely no fun
You saw me as your toy
Now that I'm not, you throw a tantrum
When life gives you lemons (L.E.M)
You don't make lemonade (O.N.S)
You use 'em to make girls cry (L.E.M.O.N.S)
You take those lemons (L.E.M)
No sugar at all (O.N.S)
And you squirt it right into our eyes (L.E.M.O.N.S)
When life gives you lemons
You don't make lemonade
You use 'em to make girls cry
You take those lemons
No sugar at all
And you squirt it right into our eyes
When life gives you lemons
You don't make lemonade
You use 'em to make girls cry
You take those lemons
No sugar at all
And you squirt it right into our eyes
I've tried to remain patient with your stupid shenanigans
But you've given me no other choice
You tried to knock me over by acting like you're above me
And pretending that I don't have a voice
And I don't wanna encourage your abusive behavior
But I just can't let you win
I'm legitimately tired of being walked all over
By these insecure babies who think that they're men
You're a sour little boy
With a fragile masculinity
You saw me as your toy
Now that I'm not, you abuse me
You're a sour little boy
Absolutely no fun
You saw me as your toy
Now that I'm not, you throw a tantrum
When life gives you lemons
You don't make lemonade
You use 'em to make girls cry
You take those lemons
No sugar at all
And you squirt it right into our eyes
When life gives you lemons
You don't make lemonade
You use 'em to make girls cry
You take those lemons
No sugar at all
And you squirt it right into our eyes
L.E.M.O.N.S
Sour little boy (L.E.M)
L.E.M.O.N.S
Fragile masculinity (L.E.M)
L.E.M.O.N.S
L.E.M.O.N.S (ahh)
L.E.M.O.N.S
Squirt it right into our eyes (L.E.M)
