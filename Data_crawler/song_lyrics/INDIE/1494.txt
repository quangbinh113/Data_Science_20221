Song Name: eye 2 eye
I ask myself if this even matters
If I climb up an invisible ladder
Seems like things, they used to be better
(Tried my best but buckled under the pressure)
Can you answer the question?
I left my phone inside the house
Do you think they would notice
If I completely remade myself?
I really thought they would like it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
Oh, well, but at least that I tried to
Look inside, I thought I'd remind you
I really thought they would like it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
Oh, well, but at least that I tried to
Look inside, I thought I'd remind you
I should probably admit it
If it weren't for the moment, I think I would've quit it
It's nice to be noticed
But sooner or later, I just know they'll forget it
Really thought I could take it
Little did they all know, I was just a good faker
And nothing has changed yet
I'm digging a hole and it's just for the sake of it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
I really thought they would like it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
Oh, well, but at least that I tried to
Look inside, I thought I'd remind you
I really thought they would like it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
Oh, well, but at least that I tried to
Look inside, I thought I'd remind you
I really thought they would like it
I realize that we don't see eye to eye
Oh well, but at least that I tried to
Look inside, I thought I'd remind you
