Song Name: Everytime
As you can see, she hasn't met him yet

She already fell in love, I bet
Her keyboard gets slammed by her fingers

But he replies with "Okay" every time
Every time
She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to
Oh
She doesn't know who he is
Yeah
He doesn't see her
He sees right through her
Oh
She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to
Oh
Her heart gets broken every time
Every time
She doesn't know who he is
No she doesn't know what he's up to
Oh
She doesn't know who he is
She doesn't know who she is
