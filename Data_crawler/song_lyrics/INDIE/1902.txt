Song Name: upside down
Where you off to now?
Runnin' 'round my head and back around
I can't help but to feel it
Your psychic existence
Isn't it comedic, how we feel the distance?
And I just checked the time
Six hours gone by
These passin' road signs
Where you off to now?
Runnin' 'round my head and back around
Now it's like my head's stuck underground
How did you turn me upside down?
Got me all tangled up
I guess you had enough
There's not much to discuss
Now you're just someone
Who know? I've had it with you
So stuck in my moods
I'm splittin' in two
Where you off to now?
Runnin' 'round my head and back around
Now it's like my head's stuck underground
How did you turn me upside down?
