Song Name: u dont kno me
No, you don't know me
No, you can't see
Show me to what I need
Focus on the dream
"Look, I wanna feel like everyone else
I wanna feel like everyone else
I wanna feel like everyone else
I just wanna feel like everyone," she said
I feel I'm falling back
To where I was long ago
Way on my own on the road again
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, days go by fast now
But oh, do they change?
Oh, I feel so tired
So much to maintain
"Look, I wanna feel like everyone else
I wanna feel like everyone else
I wanna feel like everyone else
I just wanna feel like everyone," she said
I feel I'm falling back
To where I was long ago
Way on my own on the road again
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
