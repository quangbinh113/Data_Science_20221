Song Name: Sleep Baby
Baby baby
How hard you think it'd be
To tell you the truth for me?
Baby baby
So many nights have taught me
Right from wrong
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Baby baby
Don't understand what it means
All this
Baby baby
Just doesn't get what it does
And what it takes to be us
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Dream of me
Or whatever you want to dream about
It's ok with me
Dream of me
Or whatever you want to dream about
I won't disappear
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
Sleep like a baby
Dream, my little baby, nah
