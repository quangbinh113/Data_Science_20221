Song Name: I'm In Love With You
Heartbeat
Is coming in so strong
Oh, if you don't stop
I'm gonna need a second one
Oh, there's something I've been meaning to say to you, baby
(Hold that thought)
Yeah, there's something I've been meaning to say to you, baby
But I just can't do it
What a call, moving in
I feel like I can loosen my lips (come on so strong)
I can summarize it for you
It's simple and it goes like this
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
In love with you, I- I- I- I- I (yeah)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I (yeah)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
In love with you, I- I- I- I- I
She's got her broadsheet
Reading down the list of the going wrongs (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm getting no sleep
Tossing and turning all night long (yeah)
Oh, there's somewhere I've been meaning to take the conversation
(Hold that thought)
Yeah, there's somewhere I've been meaning to take the conversation
But I just can't do it
You show me your (you show me your)
Black girl thing (black girl thing)
Pretending that I know what it is (I wasn't listening)
Apologize, meet my eyes
Yeah, it's simple and it goes like this
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I (hey)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I (yeah)
In love with you, I- I- I- I- I
In love with you, I- I- I- I- I
Yeah, I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
Yeah, I got it! I found it!
I've just gotta keep it
Don't fuck it, you muppet
It's not that deep
Well, I've been counting my blessings
Thinking this through
Just like, "One, two, yeah, I'm in love with you!"
I- I- I- I- I (come on)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I (oh, yeah)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I (yeah)
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
In love with you, I- I- I- I- I
