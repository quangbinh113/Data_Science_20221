Song Name: [oops]
All right I'll get straight to the point, I found marijuana in the house
And while I never thought of myself as the type of father who'd have to drug test his kids
I'm willing to do just that if that's what it takes to find out who brought a joint into this house
Dad, Lucy found something too
Dad, I found a joint in Mom's dresser drawer
Oops
