Song Name: It's Not Just Me, It's Everybody
Sitting at this party
Wondering if anyone knows me
Really sees who I am
Oh, it's been so long since I felt really known
Fragile in the morning
Can't hold on to much of anything
With this hole in my hand
I can't pretend that we always keep what we find
Oh, yes, everybody splits apart sometimes
Living in the wake of overwhelming changes
We've all become strangers
Even to ourselves
We just can't help
We can't see from far away
To know that every wave might not be the same
But it's all apart of one big thing
Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me
It's everybody (everybody)
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Mercy is the only
Cure for being so lonely
Has a time ever been more revealing
That the people are hurting
Oh, it's not just me
I guess, it's everybody
Yes, we all bleed the same way
Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me
It's everybody (everybody)
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me
It's everybody
It's not just me
