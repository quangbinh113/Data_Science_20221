Song Name: 5AM Empanada with You
Remember how we talked and stayed awake all night?
It's dark outside but I see the sunlight in your eyes
Remember how it felt like when your lips on mine
It is the sweetest lullaby
If time could've stayed forever
If summer never ended
Would you forever have been mine?
And you told me love would set me free
To a place that nobody knows
Now I'm still holding on alone
Without you it means none
Remember how we made love 'til it's 5 a.m.?
We walked outside, ran into an empanada place
The city's shadow, the silence, the smiles you tried to hide
The memory's all that's left behind
If time could've stayed forever
If summer never ended
Would you forever have been mine?
Now my world has turned black and white
Calling your name when dreaming alone
If I could see you just once more
I won't close my eyes
Staying awake in paradise
With you be on my side
