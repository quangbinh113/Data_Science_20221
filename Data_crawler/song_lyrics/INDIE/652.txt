Song Name: i think you're really cool
One, two
One, two, three, four
Hey,
Hey, it's, it's just me again and I
I wanted to call you and share a song that I'm working on, but I
I guess you're busy, so call me back when you get a chance
Uh, yeah, heh
I love you, bye
This song brings on the weather
Teardrops upon my sweater
I cry in bed whenever
I see you guys together
Fuck love, it's all a lie
I can't sleep, I rather die
Than see that look in your eye
It sucks that I'm not your guy, but
I think you're really cool, like
I think you're really cool, like
Yeah, I think you're really cool, like
Yeah, I think you're really cool, like
I packed my bags last week
Sunrise and I'm on my feet
Let's skip town and chase our dreams
'Cause this place ain't what it seems
So come home let's synchronize
My soft lips caress your thighs
You get me so fucking high
The voices in my head collide, and
I think you're really cool, like (I think you're really cool, like)
I think you're really cool, like (I think you're really cool, like)
Yeah, I think you're really cool, like (I think you're really cool, like)
Yeah, I think you're really cool, like
Keep your voice down
She don't care, no
I can't breathe, I've got no air
No sympathy for my despair
I cut my wrists and grow my hair
I'm outta my mind (Out of my mind, yeah)
I'm outta my mind (Out of my mind, yeah, yeah)
I think I'm outta my mind
I think I'm outta my mind
I think I'm outta my mind
I think I'm outta my mind
I think I'm outta my mind
