Song Name: Desire Lines
It's raining
In this room
And it's so hot
Outside this room
I don't know
No one here
I don't want
To be here in this room
We hold parties
In our sleep
We fill ourselves up
In our sleep
And I'll heal you when you're ill
Though it's hard keeping still in our sleep
Pries the hair out
Of her mouth
Whilst the circus
Is heading south
While we search
In the sand
Don't ask them to understand
Why they cover up their hands
And their mouths
