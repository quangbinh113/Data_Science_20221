Song Name: Shotgun
Fogged up the windows in the back
Coffee and menthol on your breath
Uppers and my heart never meshed
I hated coming down
But this feels the same without the bad things
So whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah
Cold beer and ice cream is all we keep
The only things we really need
'Cause I like dessert and alcohol
And watching as you get
Drunk and you're stumbling in the hall
So whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah
Look at your blue eyes like the stars
Stuck in the headlights of a car
You know I'll take you as you are
As long as you do me
So just let me lay here in your arms
And whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me, I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah
