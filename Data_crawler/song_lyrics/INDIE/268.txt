Song Name: I'm Good
I was so young, I was so dumb
When I gave you my heart
Think you're so mean, think you're so clean
In your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving
You look good from afar
But when you're up close you're a loser
And you lowered the bar
Ooh, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do
Or you who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know you put me through hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
You fooled me once and you fooled me twice
Don't try me again
You're coming around, tryna wear me down
But I won't be your friend
And I don't wanna say it out loud
But I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back
'Cause you're a dead-end
Ooh, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do
Or you who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know you put me through hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm doing better without you
I'm good
I'm doing better without you
I'm good
This song ain't even about you
I'm good
'Cause I'm doing better without you
I'm good
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know you put me through hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
(Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good)
Oh baby I'm good, oh baby I'm good, without you I'm good
