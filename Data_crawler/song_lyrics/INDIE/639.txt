Song Name: Slumber Party (feat. Princess Nokia)
I'm not shy, I'll say it, I've been picturing you naked
I'm a little faded, you look like a fucking painting
Big doe eyes, amazing, she's everything I've been praying
My heart palpitations, she looks like the type to break it
Me and your girlfriend playing dress up in my house
I gave your girlfriend cunnilingus on my couch
She cute, kawaii, hentai boobies, that excites me
I think she really likes me, ask politely, can I (ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
Uh, it's getting hot in here
I'm the Nelly in the party with some rocks for ears (so hot in here)
I'm a slave for you, baby, miss Britney Spears
I'm a Clover, she a Toros, bring it on for cheers
And I'm sexy like Christina when I dip it low
Not a H-town girl, but I rodeo
Yippee-ki-yay, welcome to the show
It's a all-girl party, clothing-optional
Me and your girlfriend playing dress up in my house
I gave your girlfriend cunnilingus on my couch
She cute, kawaii, hentai boobies, that excites me
I think she really likes me, ask politely, can I (ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
My girl look like Wednesday Addams
Eyes go black when she orgasms
Hide your back, she likes to stab them
My butt cheeks, she likes to grab
Matching pajama, birthday suits
Her spit tastes just like Juicy Fruit
She do that thing she usually do
Spell my name with her tongue, like uh-huh
Me and your girlfriend playing dressup in my house
I gave your girlfriend cunnilingus on my couch
She cute, kawaii, hentai boobies, that excites me
I think she really likes me, ask politely, can I (ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, oh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) slumber party
I'm shy
I'm so shy
