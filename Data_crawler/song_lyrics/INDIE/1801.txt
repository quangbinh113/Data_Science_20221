Song Name: Home By Now
Heard that you were selling your piano and your car
It feels so weird to not reach out and ask you how you are
Wonder if you're moving or if money's just that tight
These are the kinds of questions to which I've resigned my rights
Ever since
I decided
There were things
That I needed
That you couldn't give to me
But I'm still wondering
Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by now?
I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rain checks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now?
By now
Home by now (home by now)
(Home by now)
Have you ever heard about how when a person's in a maze?
They will tend to walk in circles, thinking they are going straight
They can't see the bigger picture, so they get stuck in a loop
In the end, I was afraid that that's what you and I would do
But I still
Have my moments
Where every reason
Feels a lot like an excuse
I wanna ask you
Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by now?
I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rain checks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now?
What is love supposed to feel like, anyway?
Why is it so hot in L.A. in late October?
Said I don't know if it's enough to make it last
You said if I even had to ask
You had your answer
But I still wonder
Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by now?
I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rain checks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now?
By now
Home by now
