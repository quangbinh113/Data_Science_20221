Song Name: Clementine
Takes time to put it to the test
Sometimes I only make a mess
Sunshine, forget about the rest
Through all, I still think you're the best
So long, we said too many things (do you love me?)
Like you love clementine
Sometimes you make me sad (make me sad)
Some things, they never end
Some things, some things, some things never end
There always
So, I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you in my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you in my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
My bodies
Grieving what's dead and gone
I'm holding on till it's over and done
There's never enough
I see you giving up
You change my heart
My love that carry me, oh-oh
Some things, some things, some things never end
There always
So, I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you in my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you in my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you in my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
