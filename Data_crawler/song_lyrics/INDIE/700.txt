Song Name: With Love To An Ex (feat. Moonchild Sanelly)
Where I'm from they said I live on a cloud
Simply 'cause I just dream too much
Black sheep but a' am all blue now
It's the start but I've done blew up
I haven't done none, yeah the travel's tough
Light twice sands and the waves too far
They said, "No", I said, "That's too tough"
When too google pon they system down
Ex niggas blowin' up my DMs
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or the dinner
When I say dinner, I say
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ex niggas blowin' up my DMs
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or the dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ndifun' ibars, ndifun' ipounds, ndifun' imali
Ndifun' ibux, ndifun' ibusy, ndifun' ifuni
Ndifun' ichange, ndifun'ifun, ndifun' isexi
Ndifun' indoda, ndifun' umfazi, ndifun' ichanji
Ndifun' ibars, ndifun' ipounds, ndifun' imali
Ndifun' ibux, ndifun' ibusy, ndifun' ifuni
Ndifun' ichange, ndifun'ifun, ndifun' isexi
Ndifun' indoda, ndifun' umfazi, ndifun' ichanji
Ex niggas blowin' up my DMs
Wanna meet for lunch (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah), breakfast or the dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ex niggas blowin' up my DMs
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or the dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ex be like, "You dream too much, you're out too much
You are too much, I want to munch
I love you but you got big backs
All the boys want, want what I've got
Want what I've got
Want what I've got
Ex niggas blowin' up my DMs
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or the dinner (Want what I've got)
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
