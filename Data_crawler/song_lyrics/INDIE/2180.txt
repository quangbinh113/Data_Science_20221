Song Name: Bad Dream
I bought a ticket to your show
Did you see me? Did you know?
I was standing in the back row (back row, back row)
With the lights down low
I couldn't think of the right words
Now it's just too late
Now you're somebody's baby
So I'll be on my way
I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream
I wish that somebody would wake me
Don't like this feeling, won't you shake me?
'Cause anymore might break me (break me, break me)
And you'll never know
I couldn't think of the right words
Now it's just too late
Now you're somebody's baby
So I'll be on my way
I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream
Sleepwalking through a sad scene
I been living in a bad, bad dream
I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream

Sleepwalking through a sad scene
I been living in a bad, bad dream

I been living in a bad dream
