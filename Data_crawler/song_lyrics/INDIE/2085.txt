Song Name: In Particular
Lying on my back, I heard music
Felt unsure and catastrophic
Had to tell myself it's only music
It blows my mind, but it's like that
Is anyone there? What could you tell me?
Afraid of what? Would you ever know?
Everyone else is really boring
Anyone else won't be good enough
Some place safe I would imagine
Someone new would be so cruel
Incurable paranoiac
Hysterical depression
X, X, X
Alex
I'm your only friend
X, X, X
Alex
Your love will sing for you
X, X, X
Alex
I'm your only friend
X, X, X
Alex
Your love will sing for you
Someplace safe I would imagine
Someone new would be so cruel
Incurable paranoiac
Hysterical depression
Ah
X, X, X
Alex
X, X, X
Alex
X, X
X (ah)
X, X (ah)
Alex (ah, ah)
X (ah)
X, X (ah)
Alex
Your love will sing for you (ah)
