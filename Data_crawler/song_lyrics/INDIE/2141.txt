Song Name: Burning
Believer
Took me over like a fever
Caught you hiding in the smoke, smoke, smoke
Like a meteor, I glow, glow, glow
Ooh
Lay your red hand on me, baby
Ooh, ooh
As I go
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
Well, I'll release her
From the bindings of her teachers
What they're hiding there is broke, broke, broke
Like the River Styx, I flow, flow, flow
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
