Song Name: Your Type
I'm standing by your side
I can't hide my smile
I look into your eyes
And then I look away
I can't take it
I want you to show me
Why this feels so right
I want you to notice me
I could be your type
Every single night
When i lie alone
I think about the things we could do
At home
We could watch a video
Sat knitting on the patio
We could grow old together
Cooking up tasty food
Getting us in the mood
Baby it could be so good
I want you to show me
Why this feels so right
I want you to notice me
I could be your type
I want you to show me
Why this feels so right
I want you to notice me
I could be your type
