Song Name: Sugarcane
I like how you walk with your hands in your pockets
You're starin' holes into the ground
I like how you don't look at me when you're talking
You don't wanna be here right now
And you taste the same way
I imagined you to when you look like you do
Oh, you taste the same way
I imagined you to
But you're sweet like sugarcane
You rot inside of my brain, I'm so high
I'm waitin' to crash, if I die
Well, you're worth all of that now
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane, sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane, sugarcane)
Fade in the background, your back facing the crowd
The only reason I'm here right now
I won't leave without you, I know you'rе tellin' the truth
Spitting love into my mouth
And you tastе just like my favorite flavor
I wish I could savor your touch
And you taste just like my favorite flavor
Swallowin' flames 'til I'm dust
But you're sweet like sugarcane
You rot inside of my brain, I'm so high
I'm waitin' to crash, if I die
Well, you're worth all of that now
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane, sugarcane)
I need you, it's paralyzing
And no one else fills up the empty inside me
I need you, love is blinding
I need you
But you're sweet like sugarcane
You rot inside of my brain, I'm so high
I'm waitin' to crash, if I die
Well, you're worth all of that now
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane (sugarcane, sugarcane)
Suga-suga-sugarcane
Suga-suga-sugarcane
