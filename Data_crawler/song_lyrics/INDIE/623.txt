Song Name: Fall To Me
You never change your spots
You wanna be spotless
Every step, tryna be brave
Humans never wanna stop
Until you can't stop them
I'll give my last breath to keep you safe
How could we fly with burning wings?
I'll float to you in my balloon
A thousand nights, we'll never see
I'll float to you, you'll fall to me
I'll float to you in my balloon
I'll float to you, you'll fall to me
You never change your spots
You wanna be spotless
Every step, tryna be brave
Humans never wanna stop
Until you can't stop them
I'll give my last breath to keep you safe
How could we fly with burning wings?
I'll float to you in my balloon
A thousand nights, we'll never see
I'll float to you, you'll fall to me
I'll float to you in my balloon
I'll float to you, you'll fall to me
