Song Name: Handmade Heaven
I envy the birds high up in the trees
They live out their lives so purposefully
I envy the spiders, the squirrels and seeds
They all find their way automatically
But in this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'Cause birds of a feather fly together
I carry along a feel of unease
I want to belong like the birds in the trees
I sit on my own, look over the town
The skyscrapers glow like they'll never fall down
But in this handmade heaven, it's paradise
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'Cause birds of a feather fly together
In this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
Handmade heaven, handmade heaven
And I could no longer ignore
The ivy growing tall
This life don't suit me anymore
The writing's on the wall
In this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
Handmade heaven, handmade heaven
(Bluebirds forever) Birds of a feather
(Bluebirds forever) Fly together
(Bluebirds forever) In this strange, strange weather
(Bluebirds forever) In this handmade heaven

In this handmade heaven
In this handmade heaven
In this handmade heaven
In this handmade heaven
