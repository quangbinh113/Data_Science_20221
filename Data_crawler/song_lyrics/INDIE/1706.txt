Song Name: the modern man
Where you gonna go this time
You're running from your shadow you know
The things your daddy said
Are only things inside your head
So you wanna hate me, aha
Say you wanna hate yourself
Don't be the centre of attention
No you'll only find your peace at rest
But you worry like your mother
They say you've got your brothers eyes
But cousin Johnnies faster
(He makes us very proud)
Don't you just wish you were more alive
Where you gonna go this time
You're running from your shadow you know
The things our daddy's said
Are only things inside your head
Your mind's a conversation
But your bank accounts a circus freak
Oh the sheriffs at the window
(Oh no)
Don't tell me modern man has lost his fuse
With the modern occupation
Put it in my pocket and I take it with me
Well the grass is always greener on the other side
So come on over here and won't you give it a ride
Na na na najjjjjj
Where you gonna go this time
You're running from your shadow you know
The things your daddy said
Are only things inside your head
Where you gonna build this home
They're running out of castles made of stone
And all the roads you're on
Are just the ones that he ran on
