Song Name: Emerald Eyes
The summer night, the fading light
The perfect place, the perfect time
To take you somewhere we both want to go

A starry drive in mid July
Park the car, turn off the lights
And venture through a field out on our own
The birds they sang a melody
My heart was keeping time and we
Were dancing on the edge of something new
Slow at first but still it seems
That we'll go down in history
As lovers from the start, just me and you
I've spent a thousand nights
Lost in your emerald eyes
Lost in a place where I know you can see my soul
Make me lose track of time
You and your emerald eyes
Finally found a place that I can call my home
A subtle breeze, it's you and me
Chest to chest, no in-between
And every moment's better than the last
Anything and everything
That I could ever want and need
Is standing right beside me in the grass
The birds they sang a melody
My heart was keeping time and we
Were dancing on the edge of something new
Slow at first but still it seems
That we'll go down in history
As lovers from the start, just me and you
'Cause I've spent a thousand nights
Lost in your emerald eyes
Lost in a place where I know you can see my soul
Make me lose track of time
You and your emerald eyes
Finally found a place that I can call my home
I've spent a thousand nights
Lost in your emerald eyes
Lost in a place where I know you can see my soul
Make me lose track of time
You and your emerald eyes
Finally found place that I can call my home
