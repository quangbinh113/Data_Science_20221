Song Name: Sweet Creature
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh, sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go
You bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road
You bring me home
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh, sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go
You bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road
You bring me home
And, oh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh, sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go
You bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road
You bring me home
You bring me home
