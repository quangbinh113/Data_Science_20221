Song Name: Just to Hear You (feat. Perfume Genius)
I played your song
Just to be closer to you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything from you
I told a lie
Just to hear you laugh
I know much better now
I know much better now than to ask
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
I don't need anything from you
I remember it all so clearly. sheets of light, pouring in, covering
You entirely. waves and waves of music crashing all around me
A tiny tidepool gathering in your abdomen, for me to drink
This is a place i've arrived to, over and over again
A time capsule; each time wearing a different face
But somehow the same. something happened to me
Standing outside the gates, waiting for the light to change
Waiting for the lights to change. waiting for the light to change
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
I don't need anything from you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
I don't need anything from you
