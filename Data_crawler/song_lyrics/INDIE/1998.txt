Song Name: Astrovan
Angels smoking cigarettes on rooftops in fishnets in the morning
With the moon still glowing
And here comes Jesus in an Astrovan rolling down the strip again
He's stoned while Jerry plays
He said life ain't ever what it seems
These dreams are more than paper things
It's alright mama you're afraid
I'll be poor along the way
But I don't wanna see those tears again
You know, Jesus drives an Astrovan
Yes, he does
I say whoo
And in my heart there's a holy ghost
Writhing on the floor from an overdose
You know the best ones never come down
So if I love at the tip of my toes
Reaching out for the great unknown
Every addict has illusions that
Life ain't ever what it seems
These dreams are more than paper things
And it's alright mama you're afraid
I'll be poor along the way
But I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
Yes, he does
I say whoo
That's true, yeah
But when I see those angels on the roof
I'll know I've made it when my
Doobie smoking Jesus puts my name up on his guestlist
And says son you're famous in heaven
And maybe you're famous in heaven
And maybe there is no heaven
And maybe we're all alone together now
And I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
And I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
