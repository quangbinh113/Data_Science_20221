Song Name: Alaska
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me! Oh my! I thought it was a dream
So it seemed
And now, breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh...
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh...
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learn to talk and say whatever I wanted to
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me! Oh my! I thought it was a dream
So it seemed
And now, breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh...
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh...
You and I, there's air in between
