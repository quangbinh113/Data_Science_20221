Song Name: Every Time the Sun Comes Up
Pace mine for you
Hold my horses
Patient
Hey man, tricks can't wait
To hear my emotions
Every time the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
People say I'm a one-hit wonder
But what happens when I have two?
I washed your dishes
But I shit in your bathroom
Even when the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
Even when the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
We broke your glasses
But covered our asses
Take time silently
Feel real room hi-fi
When every time the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up
I'm in trouble
Imagine when
Every time the sun comes up
I see double
Mhhhh
Mhhhh
(Yes, she is)
Maybe something will change
Hihihi hahaha
Sorry, my headphones fell off
