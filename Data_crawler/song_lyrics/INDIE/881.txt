Song Name: Like No One Does
All of these years, all of this time
Still you got all my attention
Feeling it too, when you walk by
Touching my hand like you need it
Across the room, catching my eye
I already know what you thinking
'Cause I know all of your secrets
How you talk in your sleep
Play those songs on repeat
'Til you know every single word
Those commercials you like
How they all make you cry
How you need a little space when you're hurt
The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up
The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup
I love the way
I know that you're lying
The way that you're smiling
Darling I love that I know you
Like no one does
Sit on our bed, watch you get dressed
Know we got plans, we can break 'em
I'll send a text to all of our friends
Tell 'em we're not gonna make it
All of these years, all of this time
Still you got all my attention
You got all my attention
The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up
The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup
I love the way
I know that you're lying
The way that you're smiling
Darling I love that I know you
Like no one does
Like no one does
How you talk in your sleep
Play those songs on repeat
'Til you know every single word
What you hate, what you like
I see all of your sides
And the new ones I'm trying to learn
The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up
The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup
I love the way
I know that you're lying
The way that you're smiling
Darling I love that I know you
Like no one does

Like no one does
Like no one does
Darling I love that I know you
Like no one does
