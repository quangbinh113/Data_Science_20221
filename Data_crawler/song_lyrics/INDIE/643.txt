Song Name: The Zombie Song
Our love story could be kind of gory, far from boring
We'd meet at a post-apocalypse
Yeah, I'd be slowly walking in a group stalking you
You'd be the only man alive that I could not resist
Then all of your friends, they'd try to kill us
But only because they'd be jealous
That our love is deeper than Edward and Bella's
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
You'd be hiding in a second floor apartment
Knocking all the stairs down
To save your life from the undead
Double barrel shotgun taking out the slow ones
Then you'd see the passion burning in my eye
And I'd keep my head
Then all of your friends, they'd try to kill us
But only because they'd be jealous
That our love is deeper than Edward and Bella's
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
And I'd try not to bite and infect you because
I'd respect you too much
And that's why I'd wait until we got married
Oh, and our happiest days would be spent
Picking off all your friends and they'd see
A love this deep won't stay buried
If I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
