Song Name: In My Head
I know it's not the same, but I feel it anyway
Tell me if that's okay
Know I'll be on my way, should've known, now, I feel insane
Am I insane?
I've waited way too long, yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong, I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame you see
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh-oh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
You say it's all alright, but you're not who's up at night
You'll probably say we tried
This feels like all a lie, while you tend to try and hide
Your hold has got me tied
I've waited way too long, yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong, I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame you see
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh-oh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
And nothing else is right
You're laced inside my mind
I'm holding on, I know it's wrong
But I can't see your soul
And everything has changed
You're only in my brain
I can't seem to let this be
But I guess I'll be vain
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh-oh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh-oh, you're in my head
