Song Name: Show Up
Last time I came here, I stayed at Michael's
So disappointed in our whole cycle
So I woke up, pushed myself off of a tightrope
And listened to MUNA at dawn
It's been a whole year, I think that I grew up
But I still cry every time my dad hangs up
No good intention is ever good enough
To feel like I've done nothing wrong
Nothing could ever stop my ass from showing up
To sing another song for the people I love
Sing another song for the people I love
(Sing another song for the people I love)
Driving with Gabe through stratified dry lands
We all met in Brooklyn when we were still in bands
Finding a crowd was enough grounds to grand stand
And we knew each other's songs
Nothing could ever stop my ass from showing up
To sing another song for the people I love
Sing another song for the people I love
(Sing another song for the people I love)
Storing cans in the basement
I'll be awake when the tribulation comes
I'll admit I faked it
I was freaked when all the lights went off
Nothing could ever stop my ass from showing up
To sing another song for the people I love
Sing another song for the people I love
