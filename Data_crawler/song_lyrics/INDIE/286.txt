Song Name: Chinese New Year
I'll see you at the movies
I'll see you with your lipstick on
I'm looking out for cosmos
I'm hoping that we'll get along
It's time for renovation
It's time for us to make a change
It's time for a Chinese new year
It's time for me to make a way
Then I can't
No, I can't wait to
Get back from here
No, I can't
I can't wait to get out of here
No, I can't
No, I can't
No, I can't
Wait to get out of here
I'll see you at the movies
I'll see you with your lipstick on
I'm looking out for cosmos
I'm hoping that we'll get along
It's time for renovation
It's time for us to make a change
It's time for a Chinese new year
It's time for me to make a way
Sweared a lot
And I bared a lot
I was there a lot
Last year
Wept a lot
Oh baby, you slept a lot
I was left a lot
Last year
Pleased a lot
Baby, you seized my heart
And I
Started to fall last year
