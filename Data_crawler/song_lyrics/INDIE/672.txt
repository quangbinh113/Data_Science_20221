Song Name: Panic Room
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
Hell raising, hair raising
I'm ready for the worst
Soul frightening, face whitening
Fear that you can't reverse
My phone has no signal
It's makin' my skin crawl
The silence is so loud
The lights spark and flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too
Welcome to the panic room
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
Still waiting, hands shaking
Maybe the coast will clear
But these voices, these strange noises
They followed me in here
My phone has no signal
It's makin' my skin crawl
The silence is so loud
The lights spark and flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too
Welcome to the panic room
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
There's no cryin' wolves now
'Cause the truth has settled in
Hiding under goose down
For your nightmare to begin
There's no cryin' wolves now
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
'Cause the truth has settled in
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
Hiding under goose down
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
For your nightmare to begin
(Welcome to the...)
(Welcome to the...)
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too
Hell raising, hair raising
I'm ready for the worst
