Song Name: Whatever Tomorrow
Whatever
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Forever to me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
Whatever I told you
It's forever to me
Whatever I did then
But I couldn't see
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
I'm guessing my shadow
You're guessing that's me, yeah
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Forever to me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
Whatever tomorrow
It's forever to me
We're using this shadow
Don't everything dream?
You better not follow
I better not scream
I'm swimming in you now
You're swimming in me, but
Only now I'm told
With pictures in the dark
There's a place to live
Where my chest don't start
Only right and wrongs
A thousand tiny hearts
A thousand tiny texts
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Forever to me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Forever for me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
Got the best of me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Is forever for me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Forever for me
Whatever tomorrow
Whatever that means
Whatever tomorrow
Got the best of me
