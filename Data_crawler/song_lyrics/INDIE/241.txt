Song Name: Jopping
Let's go!
I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round
'Cause when we jumping, it's popping, we jopping
Jopping (Jopping)
Jopping
You know how we get down (Jopping)
How we get down (Jopping)
How we get down
'Cause when we jumping and popping, we jopping
Step on the floor (Start a riot)
Where the competition, man? It's looking one-sided
Up like a 747, we the flyest
(Mhm) It's a lifestyle, you should try it
So 시작해, make it last, front to back, yeah, yeah
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
The roof's on fire, let it burn to an ash
We gon' keep it jopping, tell the DJ bring it back now
날아봐 like a paraglide 나타나 in a pair of slides
떠나자 out to paradise 건배해 to a better life
Gotta move, watch the money monsoon
Make the crowd go wild in a small room (Yeah)
Let me see you put it all on like a costume
어디까지 번져갈지 몰라
We love to move it, keep it going, don't stop
It's in your nature, 말해 girl what you want
춤을 춰봐 we go on and on
Champagne life, that's all you want
Don't stop lettin' it go, 'cause we got that glow
You know how we get down (Oh, jopping)
How we get down (Oh, whoa, jopping)
How we get down
'Cause when we jumping, it's popping, we jopping
I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round
'Cause when we jumping, it's popping, we jopping
Uh, you think you big, boy, throwing three stacks?
I'ma show you how to ball, you a mismatch
Opinionated, but I'm always spitting straight facts
Throwback, I might throw this on an 8 track
믿어봐 I'm a sight to see (So fresh)
Exciting, go and drop the beat (Drop, drop)
We get it jopping the party, it don't stop
축제는 이제부터 시작이니까
이 곳이 파티인데 바삐 어딜 가
We'll keep it jumping and popping here all night
Jump to the front if you want it
Hands up 손을 위로
Don't stop lettin' it go, like you don't care
I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round
모두 hear that sound (hear that sound)
틀을 벗어난 하나된 신세계를 펼쳐
Play the music loud (music loud)
살아나 'cause tonight's gonna set you free, eh (Yeah)
I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage (We don't even care)
Left to the right, we gon' make it, make it bang (And we make it bang)
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce (Come on, put your hands up in the air)
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round (Come on, put your hands up in the air)
I don't even care 한껏 달아오른 stage
Left to the right, we gon' make it, make it bang (Oh no, yeah)
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round

'Cause when we jumping, it's popping, we jopping
'Cause when we jumping, it's popping, we jopping
