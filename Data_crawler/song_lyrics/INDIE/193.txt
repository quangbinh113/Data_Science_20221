Song Name: Through and Through
I only think about it in the night time
Always in the night time
Up too late lying on the floor
Thinking I've been here for so long
Just a little too long
Think I need to get out of the door
But I've never been a brave one
Always was a tame one
Always double checked all that I knew
But that safety is a danger
Yeah there's only one way out it's through
Oh through and through
Oh through and through I'll find my way to you
Though I'll admit it may take me some time
Oh through and through
Oh through and through
I will be there for you even if we may seek a separate light
And I don't know what I've been waiting for
It feels like I'm always losing my way
I'm doubting every step I take
I know that everything finds its place
Although I wish I knew where to
I guess I'll have to see it through
Oh through and through
Oh through and through I'll find my way to you
Though I'll admit it may take me some time
Oh through and through
Oh through and through
I will be there for you even if we may seek a separate light
