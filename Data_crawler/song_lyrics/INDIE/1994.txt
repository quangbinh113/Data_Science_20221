Song Name: Social Cues
I think it's strange when people say
You're the next big thing, you'll never fade
The slightest touch, forced to fall
Sleight of the hand, modern goal
Story of child left behind
Choose your favorite vice
I don't have the strength to play nice
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh
At least you're on the radio, oh
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Take some of these, they'll ease the pain
Live fast, die young, pay the price
The best die young, immortalized
Story of children left behind
To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio, oh
