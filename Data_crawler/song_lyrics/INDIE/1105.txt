Song Name: Killshot - Slowed + Reverb
Something chronic, bit demonic
I've been on the late shift
All alone, staring at my phone
Sin and tonic, stupid promise
Something like a death wish
All alone, stare into my soul
If I wanna stay alive
You should never cross my mind
Yeah I knew it, I been through it
If I fall in every time
Wicked love will leave me blind
Yeah I knew it, I've been through it
Oh god, can you make my heart stop
Hit me with your kill shot baby, I mean it so serious
God, can you make my heart stop
Honey with your kill shot baby, I mean it so serious
Stolen nectar, misadventure
Something like a death kiss
Growing cold, under your control
Knowing better, twisted pleasure
Got me feeling breathless
Growing cold, will you let me go?
If I wanna stay alive
You should never cross my mind
Yeah I knew it, I've been through it
If I fall in every time
Wicked love will leave me blind
Yeah I knew it, I've been through it
Oh god, can you make my heart stop
Hit me with your kill shot baby, I mean it so serious
God, can you make my heart stop
Honey with your kill shot baby, I mean it so serious
(I mean it so serious)
(I mean it so serious)
Come and get that honey, sweeter than I ever knew
Tell me that you love me, love me till my lips turn blue
Come and get that honey, sweeter than I ever knew
Tell me that you love me, love me till my lips turn blue
(Come and get that honey)
Walk into my bed like (sweeter than I ever knew)
(Tell me that you love me)
How long (love me till my lips turn blue)
(Come and get that honey)
Gotchu in my head like (sweeter than I ever knew)
(Tell me that you love me)
How long, how long (love me till my lips turn blue)
Come and get that
Come and get that, come and get that, killshot baby, I mean it so serious
