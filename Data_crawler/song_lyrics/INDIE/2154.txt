Song Name: Surfing in Iceland
I was waiting right there away from
Hiding from the bad and hiding from the bad
I was standing right there in Iceland
And this is mighty rad and this is mighty rad
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
I was sitting right there in east state
Full of something bad and full of something bad
I was thinking of leaving it all here
And wait for something rad and wait for something rad
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
Don't try and be in control, it'll never turn up
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
