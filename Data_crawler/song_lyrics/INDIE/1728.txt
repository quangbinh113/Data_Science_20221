Song Name: Let me in
Your lips are tired of saying words
Your heart is tired of getting hurt
You close yourself and build these walls
When I climb up, you make me fall
Won't you let me wipe your tears
I'm here, just let me in
Your face, those eyes, they stay so tense
You say so much when you say nothin'
And all these things
That make you feel it's the end
I promise, I swear, I'll erase them
So won't you let me set your fire blazin'
Just let me in
You close yourself and build these walls
Hoping to hide your scars and flaws
I want you at your worst, unselfish way
Just let me in
