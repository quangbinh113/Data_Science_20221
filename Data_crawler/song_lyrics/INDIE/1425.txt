Song Name: Weightless
Nights like this you come home with
A heavy heart for me
Nights like this an endless kiss
Is all you really need
Let's think about nothing
Just think about nothing
Lay there and just daydream
Darling, yeah, yeah
Tilt your head back and let me taste it
Timing this good, don't wanna waste it
I'll take the load and leave you weightless
Weightless
Tilt your head back and let me taste it
Timing this good, don't wanna waste it
I'll take the load and leave you weightless
Weightless
Let's think about nothing
Just think about nothing
Lay there and just daydream
Darling, yeah, yeah
Tilt your head back and let me taste it
Timing this good, don't wanna waste it
I'll take the load and leave you weightless
Weightless
Tilt your head back and let me taste it
Timing this good, don't wanna waste it
I'll take the load and leave you weightless
Weightless
