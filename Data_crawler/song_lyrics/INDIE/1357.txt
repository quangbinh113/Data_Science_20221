Song Name: Hopeless Romantic
I don't wanna hear another love song
It's all bull, somebody got it wrong
I don't wanna hear another love song
I'm not lying I might start crying
Maybe I'm bitter but, I have no shame
So sick of niggas, always tryna run game
I'm undefeated, I never need your time
And I really don't wanna waste more of mine
How come I love you turns into fuck you
The minute I decide to know my worth
I wanna love you but barely could trust you
Isn't it a good thing I put me first
(Yeah)
I don't wanna hear another love song
It's all bull, somebody got it wrong
I don't wanna hear another love song
I'm not lying I might start crying
Who inspired the lies that y'all be writing about
Where do I find these niggas? Where they be hiding at
I only get rejects, regrets, regression comes easy
The less I expect the less it hurts my feelings
How come I love you turns into fuck you
The minute I think I've broke the curse
I wanna love you but gotta face the truth
This is never ever gonna work
I don't wanna hear another love song
It's all bull, somebody got it wrong
I don't wanna hear another love song
Im not lying I might start crying
I don't wanna hear another love song
It's all bull, somebody got it wrong
I don't wanna hear another love song
Im not lying I might start crying
