Song Name: WILD
Wild, wild, hey!
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences and up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild
Wild, wild, hey!
White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about
Running on the music and night highs
But when the light's out it's me and you now, now
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Hey!
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, hey!
