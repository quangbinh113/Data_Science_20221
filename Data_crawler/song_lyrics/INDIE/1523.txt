Song Name: Don't Miss It
The world has shut me out

If I give everything I'll lose everything
Everything is about me
I am the most important thing
And you really haven't thought
All those cyclical thoughts for a while?
And as it keeps going
I could never be involved
I could never really see in real time
I could never be involved
And as it keeps on going
I could avoid real time
I could ignore my busy mind
I could avoid contact with eyes
I could avoid going outside
I could avoid wasting my life
I could avoid
I could avoid 20 20 sight
I could avoid standing in line
I could avoid the 405
I could avoid coming to life
I could say anything I like
I could switch off whenever I like
I could sleep whenever I like
I could leave in the middle of the night

But I'd miss it
Don't miss it
Don't miss it like I did
And as it keeps going
If there's no need for the perfect image
And nothing seems that wrong
Don't miss it
When you know there's better conversation waiting for you at home
And as it keeps on going
You forget whether it was the beginning or end
When you can't believe your luck
You're with your friend
When you get to hang out with your favourite person everyday
When the dull pain goes away
Don't miss it
When you stop being a ghost in a shell
And everybody keeps saying you look well
Don't miss it
Like I did
Don't miss it
Don't miss it like I did
Like I did
