Song Name: SugarCrash!
I'm on a sugar crash
I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath
Cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit
Tired of this fucking shit
Nothing that I write can make me
Feel good
Victim of the great machine
In love with everything I see
Neon lights surrounding me
I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong
'Cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong, hit the b-b-b-b-b
Feel good
Feeling shitty in my bed
Didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears
Everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else
Just don't wanna hate myself
Just don't wanna hate myself
Instead I wanna feel good
I'm on a sugar crash
I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath
Cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit
Tired of this fucking shit
Nothing that I write can make me
Feel good
Where to now?
Got the rest of my life just spread out
Got the rest of my life to fuck around
Got the rest of my life to make sound
Where to now?
Got the rest of my life just laid out
Got the rest of my life to fuck around
Got the rest of my life to make sound
Feel good
