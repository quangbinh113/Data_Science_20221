Song Name: Green
This is erosion
Grind up rocks with your molars
A big fish swims past your rod
You can't catch it, it's far too fast
Deep hook marks in rubber lips
I see your eyes in the flowers
I'll pick a bunch for your room
Green and blue to match your pictures
You looked so good in green
I hope you're well
And you look so good with him
And I'm proud of you still
I miss your perfect teeth
I was too blunt
I hope you feel happy
That's all I want
That's all I want
Mess in the kitchen
I was so disappointed
I guess I got to my head
And I was too young to understand it
I get it now that it's too late
I never stopped feeling guilty
I'm over it, I promise that
I just gotta sing it out of me
You looked so good in green
I hope you're well
And you look so good with him
And I'm proud of you still
Take care of my shirt
Warm and red
I hope you think of me
Still as your friend
I hope you love yourself
Your body and heart
I hope you feel happy
That's all I want
That's all I want
