Song Name: Jewel
If I could keep
This moment here
Live away
Get away
And now I feel you
Cross my heart
Shining shining
Like a jewel
Ooh
Put me high on a wall
And let's not fall
Let's not fall
Sweet dreams I remember it all
I remembered it all
Doo te doo...
If I could keep this hour
And hold you gently next to me
It would sparkle like a jewel
And all this means so much to me
You know it's gone
It's gone to fast
Wish you could never be a past
But then i'll ... much more to lose
Alone and screaming
Eo eo eo...
To doo te doo...
Eo...
To doo te doo
