Song Name: Bubblegum
Chew me up
And spit me out
You're my candy
Can't go without
Follow up
Don't leave me out
You're my candy
I need you now
To wrap me up like bubblegum now
Because this life can be so troublesome now
Let's do something that we've never done now
I want to chew you up like bubblegum
All my luck
Used up now
You're my candy
Can't go without
If you must
Show me how
You're my candy
And I need you now
To wrap me up like bubblegum now
Because this life can be so troublesome now
Let's do something that we've never done now
I want to chew you up like bubblegum
(I like bubblegum)
