Song Name: Fantasy
You should know
You can go where (you)
You wanna go
I can take you there (ooh)
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me (ooh)
Take my hand to your fantasy
Going through these bottles
Fucking with these models
All the way in Cali
Foot up on the throttle
I'm focused on a vision
Trying to pay tuition
For the ones I'm missing
Family is a mission, oh yeah
Put you on to things you thought were impossible
On and on, me and you, we unstoppable
You should know
You can go where (you)
You wanna go
I can take you there (ooh)
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me (ooh)
Take my hand to your fantasy
Oh, in the dark, who you are is a star
I know what you're worth (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What you believe is what you see
And that's what you deserve
Lift your frequencies
Baby, you could be out of magazine
Just believe
Open up your mind
Realize you divine
If you know you shine
The world will see, yeah
You should know
You can go where (you)
You wanna go
I can take you there (ooh)
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me (ooh)
Take my hand to your fantasy
Yeah, yeah (ooh)
Fantasy (ooh)
Yeah, yeah (ooh)
Fantasy
