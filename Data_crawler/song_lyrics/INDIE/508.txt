Song Name: Shelter
There's no one else could ever hold me like you do
There's nowhere else that I'd rather be than with you
They call us lucky, but I think we might be cursed
'Cause the way you love me
I could drink the river dry and still die of thirst
Gimme, gimme shelter from the storm
Gimme, gimme shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta where the river's torn
But I'll be whole as long as I'm yours
Yours
There's no way out, the city sinks into the sea
But if we go down, at least I'm in good company
They call us hasty, and I think they might be right
But I know that I'd be crazy
Not to wanna be the one to keep you up all night
Gimme, gimme shelter from the storm
Gimme, gimme shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta where the river's torn
But I'll be whole as long as I'm yours
As long as I'm yours
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna think about a life without you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go to war, but I'm about to
Gimme, gimme shelter from the storm
Gimme, gimme shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta where the river's torn
But I'll be whole as long as I'm yours
(As long as I'm yours) Gimme, gimme shelter from the storm
(As long as I'm yours) Gimme, gimme shelter, keep me warm
(As long as I'm yours) Come kiss me by the delta where the river's torn
(No, no, no, no, no) But I'll be whole as long as I'm yours
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna think about a life without you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go to war, but I'm about to
