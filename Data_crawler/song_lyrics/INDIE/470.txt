Song Name: freshman year
Fuck you Joe, and Casey Knight, and even Becca, ew!
You caused some hell on my daylight
I did it back to you
Where's my phone?
I lost my keys too
Oh wait, I can't drive cause I'm too young to
Take life by the wheel
To take life by the wheel
I wanna win homecoming king
Shedded pounds and wasted tears
I know I'm not that good-looking
But it's only freshman year
My friends do drugs while I'm home crying
They never take advice so I'm done trying
Holding their heads home
I'm done holding their home
Where's my phone?
I lost my keys too
Oh wait, I can't drive cause I'm too young to
Take life by the wheel
To take life by the wheel
I wanna win homecoming king
Shedded pounds and wasted tears
I know i'm not that good-looking
But it's only freshman year
Go kill yourself, faggot
I've been told a hundred million times
She'll never like you, she'll never like you!
Hang with the girls, maggot
I've never had a friend who was a guy
He'd never like me
He'd never like me
I wanna win homecoming king
Shedded pounds and wasted tears
I know i'm not that good-looking
But it's only freshman year
I wanna win homecoming king
Shedded pounds and wasted tears
I know i'm not that good-looking
But it's only freshman year
