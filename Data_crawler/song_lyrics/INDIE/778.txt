Song Name: Become the Warm Jets
Oh, I can hear it when that old song starts to play
Cutting through my body in a familiar ways
Well, is it me or is it you who can't relate?
'Cause I can feel it when those warm jets take me away
The useless seems to matter more and more
All my life is just something I can't ignore
Consumed and enthused by all that came before
'Cause I can feel it when those warm jets start to roar
Give me everything I ever need
Or just enough so I can go to sleep
Well, is it me or is it you who came to see
The scene when all those warm jets swallow me
