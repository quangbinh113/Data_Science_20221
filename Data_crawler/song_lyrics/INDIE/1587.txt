Song Name: Fall in Love with You.
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My
Maybe it couldn't work out
In the end
Maybe this what I deserve now
Better off as friends
And I know
I'm not perfect with love
But maybe
I could be worth your love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
