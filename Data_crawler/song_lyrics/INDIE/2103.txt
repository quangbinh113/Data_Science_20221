Song Name: Shut up My Moms Calling
I just want to rewind, I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell
That it isn't you, so baby bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately, you've been acting like you hardly know me
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
I just want to rewind, I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell
That it isn't you, so baby bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately, you've been acting like you hardly know me
I've only recently begun to fall
I feel the need to go and waste it all
I tried to numb away the pain
I hope someone is watching me, watching me, watching me
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
Baby come home, home (so baby won't you say somethin')
