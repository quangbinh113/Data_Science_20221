Song Name: In Cold Blood
01110011
Crying zeros and I'm hearing 111
Cut my somersaults, sign my backflip
Pool, summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Kiss me
Hair the way the sun really wants it to be
Whiskey soda, please, your G&T's empty
Jeff's inflatables have sunk to the bottom
Pool, summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Kiss me
Kelly, let's dive, dive down
To the pool's bottom where we belong

Kelly, we're sinking like a bleeding stone
All above, crowdin' 'round so fucking loud
Mister Caspian's killer told me so
Lalalalalala
Heard it down on the radio
Lalalalalalala
My pool summer, summer, pool, summer vibe scare
In cold blood
01110011
Crying zeros and I'm hearing 111
Lifeless back slaps the surface of the pool
Pool killer, killer, pool, pool killer
Kiss me
Mister Caspian's killer told me so
Lalalalalala
Heard it down on the radio
Lalalalalalala
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer vibe scare
In cold blood
Lalalalalala
In cold blood, in cold blood
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
In cold blood
Lalalalalala
Caspian's killer told me so
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Caspian's killer told me so
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
In cold blood
