Song Name: I Guess That Was Goodbye
The summer I turned 18
Started with me running from a party
Bella was drinking in the back
My prom, night panic attack
Racing, climbing to the front door
Bolted down, 29 going 84
Ended the night on a curb
These last twelve years were a blur
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
Wonder if I can outrun September
It's not the end (yeah, yeah)
If I could pretend like when we were kids
Make friends with the dark, say, "Stay forever"
Don't let me down, down, down (down, down, down)
Nights are fair with a friend
They stay, they come in
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
But I guess Mr. Clock was just doing his job
And it's nobody's fault, but I wish it was
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye (ooh, yeah)
I guess that was goodbye (oh, oh, oh)
I guess that was goodbye
