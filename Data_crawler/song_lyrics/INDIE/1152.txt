Song Name: I Never Wanted Anything More Than I Wanted You
I'm at my lowest, caught in a moment
Tryna get over this
All of the marks I logged on the page
The waiting has got me sick
I can't get away from it now
I can't get away from it now
I try to think lightly, picture the lines
And hope that the feeling sticks
Where we're all smiling, holding the prize
I can almost imagine it
But I can't even let myself now
I can't even let myself now
I feel you in the sea, washing over me
Something in the movin' tides
Every fallin' leaf seems to say to me
"Evеrything in time"
I never wantеd anything more than I wanted you
I never wanted anything more than I wanted you
Come back to me
Come back to me
I never wanted anything more than I wanted you
I look at the trees and fall into pieces
God, I am sick of this
If I believe that this is for me
Can I make the most of it?
I can feel the weight of it now
I can feel the weight of it now
I feel you in the sea, washing over me
Something in the movin' tides
Every fallin' leaf seems to say to me
"Everything in time"
I never wanted anything more than I wanted you
I never wanted anything more than I wanted you
Come back to me
Come back to me
I never wanted anything more than I wanted you
