Song Name: Calico
Still I wait for you
As you asked me to
'Cause in the calico
On the western shores
When the colors changed
I came up short
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Safe, but not for long
So leave before the feelings gone
'Cause in the calico
On the western shores
I felt my age
And I lost my nerve
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Don't believe a word they say
When they tell you "Everything will be ok"
When it's not ok, won't be ok
And that's fine by me
It's in the calico
On the western shore
When the colors changed
I lost my nerve
I could've sworn you called my name
