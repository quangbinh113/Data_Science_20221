Song Name: Jennifer
Caught in a dream field, Jennifer
Hills rise around us, Jennifer
And do you realize we're setting alight?
To the fields, to the fields
Where we wait for our lives
Caught in a landslide, Jennifer
It's too late to stop now, Jennifer
Are you still waiting and wasting my fears?
Here it comes, here it comes
The life we never thought would begin
'Cause I was waiting on the other side of the road
You're always looking for a way to make me slow down
Let it go now, Jennifer
We were so young, Jennifer
Are you still waiting and wasting my time?
Let it slip through your hands
Let it slip through like the sand
'Cause I was waiting on the other side of the road
You're always looking for a way to make me
Slow down
But what're you doing now?
You're always gonna be wading
Through those fields
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad Jennifer
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad Jennifer
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad Jennifer
