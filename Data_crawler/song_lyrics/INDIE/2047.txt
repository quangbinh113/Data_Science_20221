Song Name: Space Song
It was late at night, you held on tight
From an empty seat, a flash of light
It will take a while to make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes, I'm on your side
You wide-eyed girls, you get it right
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Tender is the night for a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes when it falls apart?
What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost? Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place (fall back into place)
Fall back into place (fall back into place)
Fall back into place (fall back into place)
Fall back into place (fall back into place)
Fall back into place (fall back into place)
Fall back into place (fall back into...)
