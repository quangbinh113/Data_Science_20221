Song Name: Dr√¶m Girl
When I look at you
I couldn't see myself passing through
Your room
I know I needed help
And when you talked to me
All I heard was words
I couldn't say a thing
I only made it worse
And if I saw your man
Would I start a row?
Crashing through your bedroom
When he was around
And I know it's hard
When you feel this way
In love with my best friend
But I can't say a thing
I know I said some things
I know it'll never work
But when I close my eyes
You know it doesn't hurt
If I could get away
It might just do some good
But I just wanna stay
Even though I know I never should
