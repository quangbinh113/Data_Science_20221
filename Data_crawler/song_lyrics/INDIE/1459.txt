Song Name: Aubade
Old friend
Can you hear it in the soundless distance?
Love's end
I still see you in the darkest visions
When I close my eyes, I have a new place
Somewhere you can find me, somewhere to be
If you say, "Tonight," I'll have a new face
Someone with a bright eye, nothing like me
Cover up and hide
I never wonder if you'll ever find me, I can just see
When I close my eyes, I have a new place
Somewhere you can find me, somewhere to be
Open all the doors and let the light in
I don't fear anything stranger
Because most things never happen
I can't believe I'm here at all
All life is weak and shall be lost
When I close my eyes, I have a new place
Somewhere you can find me, somewhere to be
If you say, "Tonight," I'll have a new face
Someone with a bright eye, nothing like me
Cover up and hide
I never wonder if you'll ever find me, I can just see
When I close my eyes, I have a new place
Somewhere you can find me, somewhere to be
Open, visions
I don't fear anything stranger
