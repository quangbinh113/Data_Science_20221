Song Name: Lose It
When I first saw you I made a mixtape
I didn't know you'd do the same damn thing
When I said goodbye to you it went quiet
'Cuz I didn't wanna feel any pain
The last thing I want is another debutante
To take me away from my world (Take me away from my world)
And I know that wasn't us, but it still got tough
So come on, come on
And tell me why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Ya if all my favorite songs make me think of you I'm gonna lose it
When we drove up the coast we had a soundtrack
We made it feel like a film on a reel
And our story didn't have a happy ending but it still sounded good despite the way I feel
The last thing I want is another broken heart to drive me to the brink of crazy
In the end I couldn't take it 'cuz I knew we wouldn't make it
So come on, come on
And tell me why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Ya if all my favorite songs make me think of you I'm gonna lose it
Tell me why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Ya if all my favorite songs make me think of you I'm gonna lose it
In the end we were just a couple kids
Who thought and fought our way around each other
There's a mark on the town from the times we had around
But there's still some space for the rest of our lives
Sing it
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Tell me why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Ya if all my favorite songs make me think of you I'm gonna lose it
Tell me why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Ya if all my favorite songs make me think of you I'm gonna lose it
I'm gonna lose it
I'm gonna lose it
