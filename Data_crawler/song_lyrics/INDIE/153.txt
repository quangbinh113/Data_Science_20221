Song Name: t-shirt
Faded red, short sleeves
I can't forget the way you looked
Without your jeans on
It's in my drawer and you're all I dream, so
I had to let you know you left it here with me
It kills me to admit that I still want this back
And I try to forget all those feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt
Do you want it back?
I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way
I love you seems cursed
But I'm not gonna pretend to be your B word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all
I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all
I got was this t-shirt
I'd burn it in a fire if I didn't know the smell
I'd burry it six feet deep if that would help
I'd hold onto it longer
But you don't like being held
So, I'd really like to see you so
That maybe I could tell you
It kills me to admit that I still want this back
And I try to forget all those feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt
Do you want it back?
I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all
I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way
I love you seems cursed
But I'n not gonna pretend to your B word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all
I got was this t-shirt
Baby this time
You could take one of mine
And maybe there's time
Everything would be fine
So maybe tonight
We could wrong all our rights
So maybe it's time
We should give it try
I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I'n not gonna pretend to your B word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this stupid and fuckin t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
