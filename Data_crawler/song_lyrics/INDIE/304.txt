Song Name: Humongous
Don't tag me along to your show, to your broadcast
I know, I'm good at letting go
And then tag me along with your rules, with your promise
I swear you spend too much time on your phone and on your hair
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair that I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair that I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
Don't tell me I'm not, I'm not smart or I'm not worthy
I know, I couldn't let that go
And then tag me along with your hate and with your envy
I swear to God I cannot take you anywhere
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair that I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair that I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair that I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
Do you care?
Don't speak, don't be so broken and weak
I'm gonna throw up
Well baby, when will you grow up?
You've been such a joke this week
You think you're funny
When you're talking all loud and your nose is all runny
