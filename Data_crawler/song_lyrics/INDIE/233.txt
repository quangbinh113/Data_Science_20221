Song Name: Out Like a Light
Take me uptight
Strung
Up like a kite
Dumb
Wicked and white
Love me in spite
If I betray
All lonely nights
Spent out like a light
With
No kiss goodnight
We never fight
(When I'm away)
Did your mother
Always seem to hate me?
I'm sicker every every day
And now I'm terrified
Of talking to my friends
Only to stay stuck
Dreaming of our first born
And your hair covered in popcorn
You never leave
You never leave
You never leave
You leave me uptight
Strung
Up like a kite
Dumb
Wicked and white
Love me in spite
If I betray
All lonely nights
Spent
Out like a light
With
No kiss goodnight
We never fight
(When I'm away)
