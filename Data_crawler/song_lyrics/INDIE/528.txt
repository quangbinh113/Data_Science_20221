Song Name: Upper West Side
You're so rich, bet you bought yourself a diamond chain
To look real cool while you're telling all your friends it's fake
But you know it's lies
Another bitch from the Upper West Side
Credit cards cutting all of your lines, yeah
You're so cute, bet you really wanna be a star
To feel like gold when you're dancing on broken hearts
And you know it's true
You're no good 'til they're looking at you
Bad front, I can see right through, yeah
I can't stop judging everything you do
But I can't get enough of you
I sleep great knowing we will never be the same
'Cause I'm downtown hanging out while you're in pain
And I'm doing fine
Even though you're still on my mind
Train rides to the Upper West Side, yeah
I can't stop judging everything you do
But I can't get enough of you
I can't stop

I can't get enough of you, yeah
I can't stop judging everything you do
But I can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you

Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
