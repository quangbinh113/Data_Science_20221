Song Name: Train in Vain (Stand by Me) - Remastered
You say you stand
By your man
Tell me something
I don't understand
You said you loved me
And that's a fact
And then you left me
Said you felt trapped
Well some things you can't explain away
But the heart aches in me 'til this day
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
All the times
When we were close
I'll remember
These things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy
Without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there is only one thing that I can say
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love
I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
