Song Name: Then It All Goes Away
Oh, come on now, it's not always the same
You can't tell me you don't notice probably the same things
'Cause I know the things that you've been talking about, and
Sometimes I can't ever believe what you say, yeah
It's only in the way I'm feeling this down
That nothing seems to change (One, two, yeah)
You tell me everything and tell me it's fine, but
There's "something tells me that there's something going on here"
I know the way you got that look in your eyеs
And then it disappears
So then you'rе telling me, "there's something different about it"
Even though we've been circling around it
Since forever and forever
It goes like
I know the things that you've been talking about, and
Sometimes I can't ever believe what you say, yeah
It's only in the way I'm feeling this down
That nothing seems to change (one, two, yeah)
You tell me everything and tell me it's fine, but
There's "something tells me that there's something going on here"
I know the way you got that look in your eyes
And then it disappears
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
And then it all goes away
I know the things that you've been talking about
Sometimes I can't even believe what you say
It's only in the way I'm feeling this down
That nothing seems to change (one, two, yeah)
You tell me everything and tell me it's fine, but
There's "something tells me that there's something going on here"
I know the way you got that look in your eyes
And then it disappears
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
(And then it all goes away, then it all goes away)
