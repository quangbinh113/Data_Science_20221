Song Name: BITCH (takes one to know one)
Driving through the canyon
You said it like a joke
Everything gets blurry
You don't even know
How am I gonna compromise?
I know you won't apologize
You sent me down the river
Io see if I would float away
You know that it hurts when you laugh when I cry
So tell me why, tell me why
You do the things you do, oh God
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You're acting like you're innocent
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You walk into the party
You're laughing with our friends
You make it look so easy
But I just can't pretend
How can you act like everything's alright?
I don't know how we're gonna sleep tonight
You make my mind so heavy
Somebody take this weight away
There you go, laughing at me when I'm crying
So tell me why, tell me why
You do the things you do, oh God
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You're acting like you're innocent
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You do the things you do, oh God
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch
It takes a bitch to know a bitch
I'm about to lose my, my, my mind
You should hear the way you talk, talk, talk to me
I'm about to lose my, my, my mind, mind
You should hear the way you talk, talk, talk to me
(So tell me why, tell me why)
You do the things you do, oh God
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You're acting like you're innocent
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You do the things you do, oh God
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
You're acting like you're innocent
You know what they say
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
It takes a bitch to know a bitch (Bitch)
