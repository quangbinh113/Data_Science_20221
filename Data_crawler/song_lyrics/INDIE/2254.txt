Song Name: you deserve better
You, show me what I face, show me what you love
Promised not to break my heart
You lied to me, I love you too
So much, oh
My parents didn't want me, why would you?
You're the best so I will do what I will do for you
My parents didn't want me, why would you? (Why would you?)
You're the best so I will do what I will do for you
I've got problems in my brain, you help me ease the pain
Help me numb it out when I been crying in the rain 'cause
I've got these demons that I can't shake
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You, show me what I face, show me what you love
Promised not to break my heart
You lied to me, I love you too (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
So much, oh (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
You, show me what I face, show me what you love
Promised not to break my heart
You lied to me, I love you too (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
So much, oh (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
My parents didn't want me, why would you?
You're the best so I will do what I will do for you
My parents didn't want me, why would you? (Why would you?)
You're the best so I will do what I will do for you
I've got problems in my brain, you help me ease the pain
Help me numb it out when I been crying in the rain 'cause
I've got these demons that I can't shake
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Show me what I face, show me what you love
Promised not to break my heart
You lied to me, I love you too
So much, oh
