Song Name: You'll Understand When you're Older
(Woo!)
Said I'd understand when I'm older
Said I'd understand the things they do
Falls asleep on his shoulder in the breakroom
She falls asleep on his shoulder in the breakroom
She said she'd been inside for too long
Well, no shit, could you tell us something new?
You can tell he's lying 'cause his lips move
You can tell he's lying 'cause his lips move
It must be nice to be the reason
His work, it ain't so bleak
That must be what motivates you
That must be what motivates you
All he needs is to see you smiling
While you light up his whole week
Imagine the kind of things he'd do to you
If there weren't so many cameras
And you're keeping a dark secret
But you're talking in your sleep
Totally banned from the kitchen
Citing workplace health concerns
But they wouldn't tip you if it healed you
No, they wouldn't tip you if it healed you
She says the country's sweatin' out a fever
A fever born by what you do
And what kind of pressure do they put on you?
What kind of pressure do they put on you?
But, at least she's waitin' for you
Glass of wine after a long day
She'll dry your eyes on serviette
Dry your eyes on serviette
Fall asleep in her dad's Ford Mondeo
That she stole from him yesterday
You look so cute when you're so angry
If I'm goin' down you're coming with me
And you think that it gets better
Just you wait until next week
You're keeping a dark secret
But you're talking in your sleep
