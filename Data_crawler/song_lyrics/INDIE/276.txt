Song Name: I Miss Myself (with HRVY)
We need a conversation
I'm runnin' outta patient patience, you see
You never make an effort
I'm sick of always telling you what I need
So tired of chasing you
It's everything I gotta do
The city is a jungle
Killing all the nice and humble in me, oh yeah
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?

When I'm without ya
When I'm without ya
When I'm without ya
And if I'm being honest
I lost myself in my devotion to you
Don't mean that I don't want ya (don't mean that I don't want ya)
I mean I gotta find myself without you
Put my life on pause to be all you want
The city is a jungle
Killing all the nice and humble in me, oh yeah
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?
When I'm without ya
When I'm without ya
When I'm without ya
They say two hearts make one heart when both are whole
But two hearts make no heart if one of 'em's broke
Put my life on pause to be anything you want
The city is a jungle
Killing all the nice and humble in me, oh yeah
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?
I miss myself, the one I was before I found ya
Who am I now, who am I now when I'm without ya?
When I'm without ya
(When I'm without you)
(When I'm without you)
When I'm without ya
When I'm without ya
When I'm without you
When I'm without you
