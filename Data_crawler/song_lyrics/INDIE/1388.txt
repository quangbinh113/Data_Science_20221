Song Name: Hide and Seek
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to form
Crop circles in the carpet
Sinking, feeling
Spin me round again
And rub my eyes
This can't be happening
When busy streets
Amass with people
Would stop to hold
Their heads heavy
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first
Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung
Before the takeover
The sweeping insensitivity
Of this still life
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
(You won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears
They were here first
Mmm, what'd you say?
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmm, what'd you say?
Mmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Hmm, what'd you say?
Hmm, that it's just what we need
You decided this
What'd you say?
Hmm, what did she say?
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs (Paper word cut-outs)
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you (I don't believe you)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth (Hide and seek)
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you (Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care
You don't care a bit
(Hide and seek) Oh no, you don't care a bit
Oh no, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek) Oh no, you don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
