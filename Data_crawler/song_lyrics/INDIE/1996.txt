Song Name: The Sun
Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love
Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love
Why we love
We can bury
Just to know that
Like the sun
Like the sun
Hey, we're in love
Baby you know
If we can do it
We regret it
Honestly waste
Spent too much time within
Why we love
Why we love
Why we love
Why we love
Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love
Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love
