Song Name: Dear
Everyone's got a thing
A thing they don't like
A thing that makes them stand in front of the sink
With tears in their eyes
Everyone's got a thing
Maybe they won't cry
Maybe they can't even bear to utter the words
The doctor prescribed
I won't even lie
I'm screaming inside all the time
It seems like a breeze
It feels like a dream
But I don't wanna die

She can't stop hurting herself
And he won't look in your eyes
Friend, I knew every time you were lying
And he got himself messed up with the wrong guys
Everyone's got a thing
A thing they don't like
A thing that makes them double-think
When they're standing at the railway crossing lights
Gotta stop forgetting the fact
It's not just me in this god-damn world
My brain is a child, I will love him for that
But don't lose sight of your baby girl
I don't wanna wake up sometimes
And I don't wanna sing
And I don't care what happens tonight
As long as I feel something
I don't wanna wake up sometimes
And I don't wanna sing
And I don't care what happens tonight
As long as I feel something
