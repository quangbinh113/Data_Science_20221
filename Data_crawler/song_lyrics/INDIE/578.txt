Song Name: Monster (feat. King Princess)
I know we'll never grow old together
'Cause you'll never grow old to me
You're the pink in my cheeks
And I'm scared 'cause that means
I'm a little bit soft
So don't beat yourself up, Bonnie
It was just the sun that I was hiding from
We were messed up kids who taught ourselves how to live
So scared that I'm not good enough
I've always felt like a monster
Long before I was bit
Only seen as a monster
Let's just say I'm used to it
And I grew tough 'cause love it only hurt me back
But loving you is a good problem to have
And I'm used to that but I could get used to this

For the record, I stole your sweater
'Cause I just wanted you close to me
I thought shaking knees only meant I was weak
Just a little too soft
So don't beat yourself up, Bonnie
It was just the sun I was hiding from
We were messed up kids who taught ourselves how to live
So scared that I'm not good enough
I've always felt like a monster
Long before I was bitten
Only seen as a monster
Let's just say I'm used to it
And I grew tough 'cause love it only hurt me back
But loving you is a good problem to have
And I'm used to that but I could get used to this (oh)
Yeah, I'm used to that but I could get used to this
And we'll never grow old together
'Cause you'll never grow old to me
You're the pink in my cheeks
And I love that it means
I'm a little bit soft
Oh, you're the pink in my cheeks
And I love, that it means
I'm a little bit soft
