Song Name: Lotus Eater
Well, I could never be like you
I don't ever talk like that
Smiling with a sparkling drink
And stumbling in your lipstick mess
Molly was the loss of me
Yeah, it was a tragedy
But you keep hanging on
Would've make it look
Just waiting around
For someone to take you home
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late, I didn't wanna come

Ah...
Oh no, man, it's just that that looks fun
Ooh...
Well my eyes are wandering
Can we just eat the news?
And dance around the room
In a scattered point of views
Well take my hand and breathe
Babe, just count to three
I wish that I could blink
And turn all your words into ice cubes
So I could fill my drink
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late
Next time, I just won't come
Ah...
Oh no, man, I think I gotta run!
Ooh...
Well, hey, what's that called?
When you're sitting on your couch
And having fun, just being by yourself
Wondering why
We can't commit to love
The things that we got
We always want more of
But I know you'd rather have me fake it
But I'm not gonna make it

Ah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, I gotta run!

Ooh...
