Song Name: It's Not The Same Anymore
I'll keep the pictures saved in a safe place
Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but, it's not a shame 'cause
I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
I'm tired of taking stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feeling suppressed
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
But tomorrow makes me scared
'Cause it's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course (of course)
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore (it's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same anymore (it's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full of air
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
Or leaving problems on the shelf
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
I've been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else
It's not the same
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
And it's fine because
I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not sure on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on my floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better
It's not the same anymore
It's better
Yeah, yeah
