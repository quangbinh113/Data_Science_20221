Song Name: Spiral Stairs
They sent things that we all love
All is said, all it's good to know
Some things are spilling there a step above
Stock the stairs with the spiral
But it's already been done before
So, what's the point? Let's just have fun with it
Yeah, it's already been done before
So, what's the point? Let's just have fun
You keep that feeling that you've all won
Play it down, make it seem fun
Oh, you're so humble, you've already won
But how should I make it seem fun?
Yeah, 'cause it's already been done before
So, what's the point? Let's just have fun with it
Yeah, it's already been done before
So, what's the point? Let's just have fun
