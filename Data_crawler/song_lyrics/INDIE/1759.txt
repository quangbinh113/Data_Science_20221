Song Name: doomsday
Pull the plug in September
I don't wanna die in June
I'd like to start planning my funeral
I've got work to do

Pull the plug, make it painless
I don't want a violent end
Don't say that you'll always love me
'Cause you know I'd bleed myself dry for you over and over again
Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band to play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me
Only the death of me
Pull the plug but be careful
I don't wanna die too soon
I think there's good in you somewhere
I'll hang on 'til the chaos is through
Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band to play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only
The death of me was so quiet
No friends and family allowed
Only my murderer, you, and the priest who told you to go to hell
And the funny thing is I would've married you
If you'd have stuck around
I feel more free than I have in years
Six feet in the ground
Doomsday is close at hand
I booked the marching band to play as you speak
I feel like throwing up
You sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I'd have liked to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
That you did it on Halloween
I had no choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me
