Song Name: could this be love?
The chain on her pants, she looks at the ground
She laughs to herself and puts her hair down
She looks at me strange, then pushed me away
But then the next day, what game will she play?
I've never felt like this before
Oh, she's making me feel new things
I've never felt like this before
Oh, I've never had this feeling, till I saw her
She's making me feel like this could be love
But who knows, could it be love?
The way she fucks up, my heart just feels stuck
Right to the point where she doesn't give a fuck
She gives me a smile, I stare for a while
What do I do? (Do I do)
I've never felt like this before
Oh, she's making me feel new things
I've never felt like this before
Oh, I've never had this feeling, till I saw her
She's making me feel like this could be love
But who knows, could it be love?
Why, oh, why does she make me wanna scream? (She makes me wanna scream)
Why, oh, why, oh, how she tempts me (She tempts me)
Why, oh, why does she makes me wanna scream? (She makes me wanna scream)
Why, oh, why, oh, how she tempts me
I've never felt like this before
Oh, I've never had this feeling, till I saw her
She's making me feel like this could be love
But who knows, could it be love?
I've never felt like this before
Oh, I've never had this feeling, till I saw her
She's making me feel like this could be love
But who knows, could it be love?
But who knows, it's not love
