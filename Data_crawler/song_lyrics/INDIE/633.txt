Song Name: Ghost
Nobody can touch me, I'm a fuckin' ghost
Shadow in the corner while you out doing the most
Nobody can know me, keep it on the low
'Til I'm in the spotlight, giving you a show
Nobody can run me, yeah, I'm in control
Never gonna love me when my heart is so cold
Nobody can touch me, everybody knows
Never dead and gone, no, you can't kill a ghost
Baby, I did it all for you
Did it all for you
All I needed was endless devotion
Baby, I did it all for you
Did it all for you
But I'm better without your devotion
Cross my heart, never die
When I pull up you know I
I'm that bitch, ain't no lie
You can't touch this if you tried
Try to call, no one's home
Leave a message at the tone
At a party, on the low
If you show up, I'm a ghost
If you show up, I'm a ghost
Nobody can touch me, I'm a fuckin' ghost
Nothing in your hand if you tryna catch smoke
Nobody can cut me when I'm in my zone
Never take the mask off, never see the soul
Nobody can own me, single player mode
If you ain't a day one, I'd rather be alone
Nobody can touch me, everybody knows
Never dead and gone, no, you can't kill a ghost
Baby, I did it all for you
Did it all for you
All I needed was endless devotion
Baby, I did it all for you
Did it all for you
But I'm better without your devotion
Cross my heart, never die
When I pull up you know I
I'm that bitch, ain't no lie
You can't touch this if you tried
Try to call, no one's home
Leave a message at the tone
At a party, on the low
If you show up, I'm a ghost
If you show up, I'm a ghost
