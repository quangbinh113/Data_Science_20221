Song Name: They Don't See Us
Future's soul came to me
Said I'm tired of seeing
What I'm feeling
You must know
That it's been the time
For trying and fighting
Cause we are dying
But they don't see us
Think they don't need us at all
No they don't
Don't see us
Think we're replaceable
We are songbirds of peace
And we demand to sing
And to dream
You are a hounding hawk
Like we are born to bleed
And you eat
You don't see us
Think you don't need us at all
No you don't
Don't see us
Think we're replaceable
Oh Oh The fire is burning
The fire is burning
The bullets and blood
They don't leave much behind
For us to trust the power
You call yourself divine
But love it's time
But love it's time
Future's soul came to me
Said I'm tired of seeing
What I'm feeling
You must know
That it's been the time
For trying and fighting
Cause we are dying
But they don't see us
Don't see us
Don't see us
