Song Name: Heal
Take my mind
And take my pain

Empty bottle takes the rain

And heal, heal, heal, heal
And take my past
And take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind

And heal, heal, heal, heal
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
Take a heart
And take a hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, heal, heal
Take my mind
And take my pain
An empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
