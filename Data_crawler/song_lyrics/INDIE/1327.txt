Song Name: Possibility
There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All that I had was all I'm gon' get
There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All I gon' get is gon' be yours then
All I gon' get is gon' be yours still
So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one that knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know
Know that when you leave
Know that when you leave
By blood and by me
You walk like a thief
By blood and by me
And I fall when you leave
So tell me when you hear my heart stop

You're the only one that knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know
So tell me when my sigh's over
You're the reason why I'm closed

Tell me when you hear me fallin'
There's a possibility it wouldn't show
By blood and by me
And I'll fall when you leave
By blood and by me
I follow your lead
