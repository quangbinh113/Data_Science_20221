Song Name: Nothing Left To Lose
I was only 19, you were 29
It's just ten years, but it's such a long time
In a heartbeat, I would do it all again
Late night sex, smokin' cigarettes
I try real hard but I can't forget
Now in a heartbeat, I would do it all again
Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be, now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose
Callin' out sins just to pass the time
My life goes by in the blink of an eye
I know you want me
I was only lookin' for a friend
And everything that I was
And everything that I've become
Just falls into the end and
Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be, now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose
Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be, now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose
