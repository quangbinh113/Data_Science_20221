Song Name: Love Plus One
I went off to the right
Without saying good, goodbye
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake I fear?
Ay-yah-yah-yah, yah-yah
Ay-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah, yah-yah
(Then I call)
Ring, ring, ring, ring
La, la, love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
When I call love
Give love some soul
If I may, quite so bold
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake I fear?
Ay-yah-yah-yah, yah-yah
Ay-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah, yah-yah
(Then I call)
Ring, ring, ring, ring
La, la, love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
La, la, love plus one
Ring, (and a) ring, (and a) ring, (and a) ring, (and a)
La, la, love plus one
Ring, (and a) ring, (and a) ring, (and a) ring, (and a)
When I call love
Love, love, love, love plus one
Love, love, love, love plus one
Love plus one
Love plus one
