Song Name: Will o' The Wisp
Like fire
You know, you know even the stars you'd inspire
Like flame
I know, I know that loving you will bring me pain
I know I've taken all leave of my senses
I want to be closer to you
Nearing your sight I become the nothingness
Lose myself in your light
How can I make you take me away to the land that you call your own?
Give your love to me, make me so happy
I won't ever want to go home
Will o' the wisp
I can't turn away or resist
White fire deep in the blue
Hopelessly drawn into you
Like truth
You know, you know everybody loves you, adores you
Like air
I know, I know I'm invisible, I'm not there
Can't be too quick to deny my heart
It's beating so fast in the dark
I'm like a planet revolving around you
Why then can't you want me too?
How can I make you take me away to the land that you call your own?
Give your love to me, make me so happy
I won't ever want to go home
Will o' the wisp
I can't turn away or resist
White fire deep in the blue
Hopelessly drawn into you
Drawing me closer, leading my heart away
It's getting darker, longing for you this way
You're like a beacon, leading me through the night
Do I deserve you? Do I deserve your light?
Will o' the wisp
I can't turn away or resist
White fire deep in the blue
Hopelessly drawn into you
Will o' the wisp
I can't turn away or resist
White fire deep in the blue
Hopelessly drawn into you
Will o' the wisp
I can't turn away or resist
White fire deep in the blue
Hopelessly drawn into you
