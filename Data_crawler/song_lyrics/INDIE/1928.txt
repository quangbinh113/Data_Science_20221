Song Name: New Gold (feat. Tame Impala and Bootie Brown)
But in the magic cove
There's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes, 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder
Moved to a spot, I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything
But nothing to do
I'm tilted in a Tesla
Partna, ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca
They on them Xanies
Liposuction scheduled for Granny
She wants to save some, add to her fanny
Girls trip, Miami at the end of the year
Polluted filled skies, trying to think clear
I heard the bad news while I was shedding a beer
Watch out for them cults, Paul Revere
We all play our part in the devil's cheer
Run to the hills cause the end is near
But in the magic cove
There's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder
A desolate city
Where it hurts to smile
Ran into the reverend
He said, "It's been a while"
I'm raining in a rando
She's a social scandal
We gave ourselves a handle
When it's too much to bare
ABC Boys
Raided the mayor
Like Shawn he's a ryder
Took on the dare
Now he's singing like a birdie
Pulling on his hair
Trending on Twitter
Is what some of us live for
Friendships in and out
Fucking revolving door
All of this is a joke, Pauly Shore
Bullshit keeps coming
Maybe I'm a Matador
What are we living for?
Are we losing our minds
Because life got in the way
They will be here just in time
Your replacement is here to stay
(Ahhhhh)
New gold
Fools gold
Everything will disappear
Someone
Out here
I've travelled far too many years
To nowhere
Nowhere
Nothing here is ever real
New gold
Fools gold
Everything will disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
But in the magic cove
There's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder (new gold)
But in the magic cove
There's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes, 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder (new gold)
But in the magic cove (Ahhh)
There's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes, 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder (new gold)
But in the magic cove
There's a pretty one (new gold)
I asked her where it goes, 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater (new gold, fool's gold)
That's the way it goes in this silly wonder (everything will disappear)
