Song Name: Smithereens (with Rachel Chinouriri)
You listen to The Smiths, and we never go out
Then you tell me how you feel, and we kiss
Then we fuck, then you shut me out
When you leave my house
There's a light that never goes out
I'll never turn it off
You can find it the next time you let me down
But you look so fine
Yeah, you look so cool
And you waste my time
Even when you're not around, I still talk about you
And you know I tried
But you look so cool
I'm too bored to let go
So I'll sit in my room, and I'll cry over you
And I leave the light on when I go to bed
It takes me three hours
So I'll sit, and I'll think about you instead
But you look so fine
Yeah, you look so cool
And you waste my time
Even when you're not around, I still talk about you
And you know I tried
But you look so cool
I'm too bored to let go
So I'll sit in my room, and I'll cry over you
You look so (you look so)
And you're so, oh (and you're so, oh)
You look so (you look so, oh)
And you're so, oh (and you're so, oh)
You look so, oh (you look so, oh)
You look so, oh (you look so, oh)
You look so, oh (you look so, oh)
You look so, oh (you look so, oh)
You look so (Mm)
