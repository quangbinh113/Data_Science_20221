Song Name: Hate Me!
Walk with the flowers
Talk with me for hours
Tell me all that brings you grace
Tell me 'bout your powers
I give you all my power
Something to rewind today
Walk with the flowers
Talk with me for hours
Tell me all that brings you grace
Tell me 'bout your powers
I give you all my power
Something to rewind today
'Cause you could say you hate me
And I would say I love you
You could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
'Cause you could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm right here
You could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm not scared
You could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm right here
You could try to break me
And I would say I love you
I know I'm fucking broken
I'm right here
Walk with the flowers
Talk with me for hours
You could make me walk through flames
Tell me when it's over
Swear we're never sober
Sun is burning on my face
I'll tell you till we're older
I'm never getting over
The way you made me feel that day
This will make you hate me
But you could never break me
'Cause you could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm right here
You could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm not scared
You could fucking hate me
And I would say I love you
You could act just like that
I'm right here
You could try to break me
And I would say I love you
I know I'm fucking broken
I'm right here
Walking with the flowers
Talking for hours
Tell me it brings you grace
Telling my powers
Giving my powers
Rewinding today
