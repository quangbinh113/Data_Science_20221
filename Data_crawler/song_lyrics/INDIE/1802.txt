Song Name: wide eyed
I saw her dancing at a funeral and that's where it starts ya
In Asbury Park
There's something absolutely beautiful about who you are, yeah
A smile in the dark
All my songs about you
Heaven's lost without you
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
Life has no meaning it's inherently a gift
Find acceptance in absurdity in the meaninglessness
Found a lady who's a little bit of crazy and the right amount amazing
But still fit into this phrasing
So, I say that
All my songs about you
Heaven's lost without you
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
Hey, you got my heart in a holster, babe
I wanna live in your goddamn veins
If that's okay, yeah
The wide eyed tongue tied, three, four
