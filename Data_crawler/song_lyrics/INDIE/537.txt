Song Name: Apollo
Yeah, woah, woah, woah
Ahh, woah, woah, woah, ah
Oh baby (Baby)
Let's (let's) fuck one more time
If your nigga keep runnin' you down
Put your phone on D.N.D and pay him no mind (fuck that nigga)
And this bitch really listen to me
And it's so sad, this hoe out of line
But I'm with the fuckery
I like em' touchin' me just don't get close to my .9 (Yeah)
Ksubi's on, I'm feeling wavy as ever (Feeling wavy as ever)
If you do me wrong, I'ma move on to the better (I'ma move on to the better)
Yeah, and I'm paranoid, so I just hold on my Beretta
This bitch she a 'lil baddie
Told the bitch to add me it's now or never (Yeah)
And we met at New Apollos (New Apollos)
And she fucked me for a ride (For a ride)
And I'm turnt in the spot
If he get to actin' stupid
Imma get to shootin' watch his body drop (Bow)
This night, it will never end
I can't take a L all I do is win
This hoe she just fronted on me now I'm mad
I'm boutta go try up on her best friend
These bitches be actin' hot, but they trash
That's why I act blind in these Ray Bans
I'm really a sex addict
I just fucked Kesha now I'm boutta go link Raven, yeah
It's really a litty night, this gold Magnums is gon' get me right
They saved me from babies and girls going crazy
I won't have a baby through the night (Can't have my baby)
You know we be buggin, you know we be thugging
You drop a four, then we start a fight
You know we be buggin, you know we be thugging
You drop a four, then we start a fight (Bow)
Oh Baby
Let's (let's) fuck one more time
If your nigga keep runnin' you down
Put your phone on D.N.D and pay him no mind (fuck that nigga)
And this bitch really listen to me
And it's so sad, this hoe out of line
But I'm with the fuckery
I like you touchin' me just don't get close to my .9 (Yeah)
And we met at New Apollos (New Apollos)
And she fucked me for a ride (For a ride)
And I'm turnt in the spot
If he get to actin' stupid
Imma get to shootin' watch his body drop (Bow)
Step out of my house, and look down
I'm dripped out
This bitch flirting with me
Imma back my big dick out (Suck It)
This big glizzy on my side, watch the bullets spit out (Bow)
And I can't forget the gang all my niggas really dripped out (Yeah)
I just seen my ex, and I rode by
Nappy Boy from the 4 and I don't say hi
Let's turn up a little more, that boat she drive
Ice cup from the corner store, and we gettin' high
Ksubis on, I'm feeling wavy as ever (Feeling wavy as ever)
If you do me wrong, Imma move on to the better (Imma move on to the better)
Yeah, and I'm paranoid, so I just hold on my beretta
This bitch she a little baddie
Told the bitch to add me it's now or never (Yeah)
And we met at New Apollos (New Apollos)
And she fucked me for a ride (Ride)
And I'm turnt in the spot
If he get to actin' stupid
Imma get to shootin' watch his body drop (Bow)
Yeah, ooh, baby
Yeah, ooh, ooh, baby
