Song Name: hate to be lame
It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the Internet
Told me that that's how you know you're fallin' in love
Don't really trust what's on the Internet
But maybe just this once
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you
It's always on the tip of my tongue
But I stop myself from sayin' it
Tell myself it's not the right time or something dumb
But then you kiss me like you do
And we're right back where we started from
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you
Do I love him? Do I need him?
Do I want him? Do I care enough to say
That I love him, that I need him?
'Cause I don't, but I want to feel okay
If I love him, if I need him
Maybe that will make him stay
If I lie, will I still feel this way?
It's always in the back of my mind
Maybe my mistakes are the reason
That I made it back to you in time
If I could rewind, would there be some butterfly effect?
What if we never met? What if the stars never aligned?
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you
Alright, you ready?
Two bars
