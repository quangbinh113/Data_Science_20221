Song Name: Dreams Tonite
Rode here on the bus
Now you're one of us
It was magic hour
Counting motorbikes
On the turnpike
One of Eisenhower's
Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who starts a fire just to let it go out?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonite?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite?
On a weird guitar
Said you wrote a while
In the waking hour
In fluorescent light
Antisocialites
Watch a wilting flower
Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who builds a wall just to let it fall down?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonite?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite?
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
Don't sit by the phone for me
Wait at home for me, all alone for me
Your face was supposed to be
Hanging over me like a rosary
So morose for me, seeing ghosts of me
Writing oaths to me, is it so na√Øve to wonder?
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
If I saw you on the street (Don't let motion)
Would I have you in my dreams tonite, tonite? (Distort everything)
