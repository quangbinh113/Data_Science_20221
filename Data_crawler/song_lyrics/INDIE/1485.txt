Song Name: The Sway
Stick shift and a boatload of Brio
Counting every day we non-zeroed
Caught sifting through our clothes on the way home
Soft split a bar of 12 and Modelo with me
Had some discourse on the nuance and confusion
'Bout the difference between your lovers and your muses
I can't help the way that I've been cruising, oh but
Please share all your stains and your bruises with me
You're leaning in
I'm leaning away
You think that you could love me through the sway?
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Post that can't help but bite on your lower lip
I slept while you were twirling an е-cig
Takes gumption to be brave and еmpathic
Made sense to get your confidence polished with me
You're leaning in
I'm leaning away
You think that you could love me through the sway?
You could love me through the sway
And this is all that matters
The kitty corner patterns
Our favorite friends' catchphrases
The flat collage of faces
And when you fell from my mouth
Crashed on the corduroy couch
You couldn't bear to bring me downstairs in the morning
I'm leaning in
You're leaning away
You think that you could love me through the sway?
You could love me through the sway
You could love me through the sway
Aah
Aah
Aah
