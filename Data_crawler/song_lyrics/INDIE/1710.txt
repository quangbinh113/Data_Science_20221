Song Name: Pictures of You
I didn't want to say it
Thought it would occur to you
I tried to just forget it
Wasn't something I could do
I never want to let it get to
Where it got with you
Now I can't depend on you
Lately
I've been at home and I'm all alone
Thinking of you
Because baby
I know that it's wrong
I've been holding on
To pictures of you
Lately
I've been at home and I'm all alone
Thinking of you
Because baby
I know that it's wrong
I've been holding on
To pictures of you
I don't know where things are headed
It's something that I never knew
It's not what I intended
Wanted to be clear with you
But now that things have endеd
I'm finding things to get me through
Since now I can't dеpend on you
Lately
I've been at home and I'm all alone
Thinking of you
Because baby
I know that it's wrong
I've been holding on
To pictures of you
