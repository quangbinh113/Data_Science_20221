Song Name: The Dress
Do you still take a long time to get ready?
'Cause you used to make too much out of that kind of stuff
When you turn your head around and it kills
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I wait a long time just to see you
I'm happy to be catching up
No, we don't have to patch things up
Just turn the lights down, the thrill
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will (so)
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's a question, answer I don't have
(I can't tell)
Okay, I took a long time to get ready too
'Cause I didn't remember it and my hair got heavy like it tends to do
When I know that ain't part of the deal
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I hated myself for some time
For the things that I said, the things that I put in your head
And I tried and I tried and I failed
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will, so
We should go out and dance like we used to dance

We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Maybe that's a question, answer I don't have
Maybe that's a question, answer I don't have, mhmm
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Maybe that's a question, answer I don't have
Maybe that's a question, answer I don't have
(Maybe that's a question, answer I don't have) we should go out
We should go out
Go out
