Song Name: Boys Will Be Bugs
I'm a dumb teen boy
I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government
And I really need a hug
I feel stupid (stupid), ugly (ugly)
Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong, but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs
It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world?
I bet it's just so much better
I just turned 14
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now, and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Boys will be bugs, right?
I'm a dumb teen boy
All I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried
And I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me
Their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don't say much, but
They have always listened to me
The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they're lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it
I just turned 14
And I think I know everything
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now, and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Boys will be bugs, right?
Just turned 14
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
Just turned 14
And I think I know everything
Just turned 14
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
Just turned 14
And I think the world revolves around me
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now, and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now, and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now, and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
