Song Name: The Problem Song
Oh, this is my favourite song
I am not my name
I am not my job, I am not my fate
I am not my lover
But I love her
I am not okay
Smiling through the pain, life's a give and take
But we love like no other
Yeah, I love her
Yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we need fixin'
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of patience
I put paper to pen and therapy said
Maybe we can start again
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know we can fix them
So what we've got our problems
And sometimes we hit rock bottom
'Til we cuss and cry and cuddle
It ain't perfect but I love it, yeah
'Cause when I fall down, you're lifting me up (you're lifting me up)
Glass half empty, you're fillin' me up (fillin' me up)
Can't feel high if you ain't been low
So I need to know that you know that
(Yo, guys, come get in this)
Yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we need fixin'
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of patience
I put paper to pen and therapy said
Maybe we can start again
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know we can fix them
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems
'Cause yeah, we got some problems
Baby, we're surviving
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of pavement
And baby, I put paper to pen and therapy said
Maybe we can start again
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know we can fix them
