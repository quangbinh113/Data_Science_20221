Song Name: This Is Home
Often I am upset
That I cannot fall in love but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here
I'll cut my hair
To make you stare
I'll hide my chest and I'll
Figure out a way to get us out of here
Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
There's too many colours
Enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead?
Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
My eyes went dark
I don't know where
My pupils are but I'll
Figure out a way to get us out of here
Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this trainwreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh
Time is
Slowly
Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place
