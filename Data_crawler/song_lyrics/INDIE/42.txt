Song Name: temporary nothing
How does it feel
To feel nothing at all, I wonder
I imagine it's grey
Like the world has suddenly lost its colour
But I'd be lyin' if I said
I hadn't wished to feel nothing at times
To feel nothing
'Cause feelings are painful
And I don't wanna suffer through
All those moments without you
When I lost you
Anger and sadness they're always there
They're always pretty rough to cope with
Feelings, oh feelings, you tear me apart
And I wish I could start again
But I know that there's the other side
The one that I can't see right now, but I'll find it
And when I do I'll be
So better for the rest
So much better in my chest
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
And when you do you'll be
So happy that you felt
So happy that you dealt with it
Yeah, you dealt with it
Feelings, oh feelings, you tear me apart
And I wish I could start again
Again
But I know that there's the other side
The one that I can't see right now, but I'll find it
And I used to think
That being numb would ease the pain
But I was wrong
I was so wrong
It's just better to feel and know you're alive
While reminding yourself that it's temporary
Oh, it won't last for long
