Song Name: The Butterfly Effect
Here we are
Tears are dripping to your lips
Who would ever guess
We got here from that kiss
Now you say
Everything that you would change
But we pushed too far
With no chance to erase
Like the butterfly effect
It was only just a speck
That made into a broken hearted mess
Like the butterfly effect
It's so easy to regret
But I would never change the way we left, whoa-oh
Though I wish you never broke my heart
I don't want a brand new start
I'm not me without my scars, whoa
Though I wish we never fell apart
It made us who we are
And at least we left a mark
Don't you dare
Say it was all a waste
'Cause we would never be
The way we are today
Now we find
Beauty in all the pain
There's a reason for
The rainbow through the rain
Like the butterfly effect
It was only just a speck
That made into a broken hearted mess
Like the butterfly effect
What you get is what you get
But I would never change the way we left, whoa-oh
Though I wish you never broke my heart
I don't want a brand new start
I'm not me without my scars, whoa-oh
Though I wish we never fell apart
It made us who we are
And at least we left a mark
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, butterfly effect, oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Like the butterfly effect
Wonder if we never met
Would I have lost my heart inside my chest?
Like the butterfly effect
It's so easy to regret
But I would never change the way we left
