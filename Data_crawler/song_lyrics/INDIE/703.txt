Song Name: I Was Sad Last Night I'm OK Now
My palm been itchin' for some days now
I was sad last night, I'm okay now (Yeah)
Got some money from the bank, put a 20 in the tank
Best friend gave me five, that's a Paypal (Paypal)
'Cause lately this shit been trickin' on me
My bad lil' bih' went missin' on me
All my confidence sure went missin' on me
Ain't seen you in a while, are you checkin' on me?
'Cause I was sad last night, I'm okay now
I was hungry as fuck, I just ate now
But the state that I'm in got me anxious again
Are these checks comin' in? (Any day now)
I'm on the grind everyday like Pretty Ricky
I want a house by the lake like Ricki, Ricki
I don't really need much, I just need a couple bucks
Man, this broke shit suck like a hickey, hickey
I was sad last night, I'm okay now
You ever been so hungry you just lay down? (Yeah)
You ain't even eat, you just went to sleep (Yeah)
Just so you could dream 'bout some takeout? (Takeout)
Number five with a Sprite, yeah (Number five, number five)
Supersize on them fries, yeah (Supersize, supersize)
Apple pie on side (Extra fries)
Wait, add some chicken nuggets
You hungry?
My palm been itchin' for some days now
I was sad last night, I'm okay now (Yeah)
Got some money from the bank, put a 20 in the tank
Best friend gave me five, that's a Paypal (Paypal)
'Cause lately this shit been trickin' on me
My bad lil' bih' went missin' on me
All my confidence sure went missin' on me
Ain't seen you in a while, are you checkin' on me?
'Cause I was sad last night, I'm okay now
I was hungry as fuck, I just ate now (Yeah)
But the state that I'm in got me anxious again
Are these checks comin' in? (Any day now)
I'm on the grind everyday like Pretty Ricky
I want a house by the lake like Ricki, Ricki
I don't really need much, I just need a couple bucks
Man, this broke shit suck like a hickey, hickey
I was sad last night (Night)
I was sad last night (Last night)
I was sad last night (Yeah)
I think I'm okay now
Fuck it up, yeah (Fuck it up)
Give me everything that you got, yeah (Yes)
