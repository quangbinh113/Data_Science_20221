Song Name: Wishful Thinking
Not like I think about it night after night
Your name is echoing inside of my mind
Then I got to know you
All false hopes rued
And then I opened
Right up to you
This stupid act, that thing's aren't bad
We could never be like that
Live far away now, that's no joke
No way to reach you when I'm low
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
I do remember everything that you said
Won't let that pointless talk stay trapped in my head
Then I got to know you
All false hopes rued
Those days are gone now
You left too soon
This stupid act, that thing's aren't bad
We could never be like that
Live far away now, that's no joke
No way to reach you when I'm low
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Everything you said
Makes sense to me right now
You were just transparent
Afraid that'd I'd work out
Everything you said
Makes sense to me right now
You were just transparent
Afraid that'd I'd work out
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Everything you said (You said)
Makes sense to me right now (Right now)
You were just transparent
Afraid that'd I'd work out (Work out)
Everything you said (You said)
Makes sense to me right now
You were just transparent
Afraid that'd I'd work out
(Afraid that'd I'd work out)
