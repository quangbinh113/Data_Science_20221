Song Name: For Now
Sometimes I think about the ones that we've replaced
All the millions underneath the burnt and waste
And I get sad, because of course we'll be the same
All of history collapsing in its wake
Maybe it's enough that I have laid here
Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head, and
Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together
And that we are the ones
We are the ones
We are the ones for now
I heard that someday when they look up at the night
They'll see nothing, but a black and starless sky
And they'll tell stories of some old and callow time
Claiming spectacles of brilliant burning lights

Maybe it's enough that I have laid here
Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head, and
Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together
And that we are the ones
We are the ones
We are the ones for now
So, maybe this is what it takes to realize
I am grateful just that I have been alive
And I'll be happy if I look back on my life
Been a sister, been a mother, been a wife
Maybe it's enough that I have laid here
Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head, and
Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together
And that we are the ones
We are the ones
We are the ones for now
