Song Name: B4
I'm not sure if I want to go
Or maybe anytime at all
Funny how things process too slow
Tell me if you felt this before
Hide all your blatant inhibitions
Can't see if I'm not searching for
All your expensive superstitions
Tell me if you felt this before
Before, before, before, before
Before, before, before, before
Before, before, before, before
Oh, I can't tell, I can't tell
You felt this before
I wish I didn't have to go
Tell me, what are you looking for?
Some days, now seem to go too slow
Tell me if you felt this before
Before, before, before, before
Before, before, before, before
Before, before, before, before
Cuz I can't tell, I can't tell
You felt this before
I can't tell, I can't tell
You felt this before
I can't tell, I can't tell
You felt this before
I can't tell, I can't tell
You felt this before
