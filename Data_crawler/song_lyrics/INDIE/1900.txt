Song Name: Good For You
My swollen (lightning rod)
Lying face down in my bed
I think I'm dying (like a dog)
Every time I get upset
It takes a lifetime (to understand)
I don't remember what I said
It happened slowly (on the clock)
I missed the messages you sent
Full of love and full of sadness
I miss everything you said
Full of love and full of sadness
I miss everything you send
Be specific (this could last a long time)
If there's something that you need
For some reason (this could be the last time)
You don't think that I am real
I'm not nervous (this is a good plan)
But I don't know what I feel
I think about it (I am)
And I feel like I can breathe
And you could imagine the rest of your life
Well, good for you
And I could imagine the end of the world
And nothing else
Take it in turns
To tell everyone else about it now
(This is a good plan)
She always forgets that I'm here
I don't think about it now
(I am a good man)
And you could imagine the rest of your life
Well, good for you
And I could imagine the end of the world
And nothing else
Take it in turns
To tell everyone else about it now
(This is a good plan)
She always forgets that I'm here
I don't think about it now
(I am a good man)
(I am a good man)
(I am a good man)
(I am a good man)
(I am a good man)
