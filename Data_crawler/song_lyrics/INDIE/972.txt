Song Name: Crazy Love
(Nobody do it like-)
Livin' in a hurricane
We're too busy cleanin' up the mess we've made
But the colors never fade
We're so good at cuttin' to the chase
You got me locked into a gaze
We're in this forever
You're more than just a phase
Girl, you make me better
I'll do all that it takes to remember
What we've got together
I'm into this crazy love (ooh-oh)
Nobody do it like we do (like we do)
This crazy love (crazy love)
Your touch got me feelin' new
I'm into this crazy love (crazy love)
A crazy love (nobody do it like-)
We put in the overtime
We're workin' beyond the nine-to-five
Stayin' on our grind
To keep the joy and to make it right
You got me locked into a gaze
We're in this forever
You're more than just a phase
Girl, you make me better
I'll do all that it takes to remember
What we've got together
I'm into this crazy love (ooh-oh)
Nobody do it like we do (like we do)
This crazy love (crazy love)
Your touch got me feelin' new
I'm into this crazy love (crazy love)
A crazy love (nobody do it like-)
Minding our own business
Just me and you
We're dancin' in our element
I'll follow your cue
Minding our own business
Just me and you
We're dancin' in our element
I'll follow your cue
I'm into this crazy love (crazy love)
Nobody do it like we do (like we do)
This crazy love (crazy love)
Your touch got me feelin' new
I'm into this crazy love (your touch got me)
A crazy love (nobody do it like-)
