Song Name: Feels Like a Dream
They said this phase wouldn't last
But do you still got my heart beating fast
This feeling never gets old
You got me locked and I've lost all control
Lets run away and fall together
Baby we can make our love last forever
It still feels like a dream
It still feels like a dream
Playing over and over
This can't be what it seems
I'm scared of waking up
Don't want this dream to be over
They said I'd get over you
But when I'm leaving my heart breaks in two
This feeling's never the same
You got me falling when you say my name
Lets run away and fall together
Baby we can make our love last forever
It still feels like a dream
It still feels like a dream
Playing over and over
This can't be what it seems
I'm scared of waking up
Don't want this dream to be over
Lets run away and fall together
Baby we can make our love last forever
It still feels like a dream
It still feels like a dream
Playing over and over
This can't be what it seems
I'm scared of waking up
Don't want this dream to be over
It still feels like a dream
It still feels like a dream
Playing over and over
This can't be what it seems
