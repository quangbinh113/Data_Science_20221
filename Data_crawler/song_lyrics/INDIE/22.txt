Song Name: Dissolve
No flask can keep it
Bubble up and cut right through
But you're someone I believe in
You heat me like a filament
Anytime you're in the room
But you burned me and I'm smoking
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
Can't find an exit
I wander in a maze alone
If I find you will you shock me?
Left left and right right
Pretty sure that I've been here before
And it isn't what I wanted
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
Your voice's like an angel
Been chain smoking all month long
Like you're someone I believe in
Am I only a lab rat?
Someone you can test things on?
This isn't what I signed up for
I just wanted you to
I just wanted, wanted
I just wanted you to

I just wanted, wanted
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
