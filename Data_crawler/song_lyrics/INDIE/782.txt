Song Name: Seize the Power
Woke up this morning, I feel so fucking important
I looked in the mirror, I'm different, I finally made a decision
All the rejected that lost a lack of respect in
Themselves 'cause people get hectic
They hurt you and make you feel helpless
They're not brave like you, they're too scared to do
Anything that's different, anything that's new
I don't need lessons, I do what I want, it's refreshing
As soon as you taste independence, you start living life in the present
Hey there, how you been?
I'm that voice in your head, and I know you been aching
When you find me, let me in
I got power in my hands, and it's yours for the taking
Give me a rule and I'll break it, your conscience needs a shaking
I've been here before, I know the mistakes you'll be making
Forget the past, it's over, forget being the joker
Let 'em know that you're home and you're in control
Gather 'round, here's how to get what you want
Introduce a new religion of feeling like a boss
You don't need lessons, you do what you want, it's refreshing
As soon as you taste independence, you start living life in the present
Hey there, how you been?
I'm that voice in your head, and I know you been aching
When you find me, let me in
I got power in my hands, and it's yours for the taking
Hey there, how you been?
I'm that voice in your head, and I know you been aching
When you find me, let me in
I got power
This power is yours for the taking
This power is yours for the taking
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm, I'm, I'm a believer
This power is yours for the taking
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm, I'm, I'm a believer
This power is yours for the taking
This power is yours for the taking
This power is yours, take it
