Song Name: Paper Bag
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality, I knew, was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances were
Approaching to be grabbed, but as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love
And I went crazy, again today, looking for a strand to climb
Looking for a little hope
Baby, said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine
A fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on, put a little love here in my void
He said it's all in your head
And I said so's everything, but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man, but he was just a little boy
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills 'cause
I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works when it costs
Too much to love, hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works me when it costs
Too much to love, hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
Because I know that I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving
It works when it costs too much to love, mmm
