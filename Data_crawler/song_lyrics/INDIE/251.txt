Song Name: Beachboy
I swear to fucking God, Chris
I'll turn this fucking car around
Shut the fuck up!
I don't get parties or getting high
I just get low most of the time
And I'll be there for you, baby, but I've got to have some room
And you gotta keep your eyes on the new guys in the room
And the way they dance is crazy, I have never seen this shit
And the strobe light's way too hot, so let's get this over with
She says, "Your lips tasted like they did way back in July"
Headaches and overdose, I hope that we never die
October's always here, November's never leaves, December disappears
She says to me, "Well, I dance so fast, so you've gotta dance real fast
And my friends are all passed out in the back of my friend's van"
And she's got this sexy hair braid that goes over her forehead
Lindsey, let me kiss your forehead
And I know that you think that I don't care
About all the friends I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night
Screaming out their shattered minds
I know that you think that I don't care
About all the friends that I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night
Screaming out their shattered minds, hey!
And she's on top of me, and it is hot, hot, hot
She says, "Come on, sweetheart, take 'em off"
So I will take 'em off, and then we take 'em off
And then her dad walks in, oh shit, her dad walks in
She says to dance really fast, "'Cause I like to dance real fast
And my friends are all passed out in the back of my friend's van"
And she's got this sexy hair braid that goes over her forehead
Lindsey, let me kiss your forehead
And I know that you think that I don't care
About all the friends I left behind
The one's who stay up late at night
Screaming out their shattered minds
I know that you think that I don't care
About the friends that I left behind
The one's who stay up late at night
Screaming out their shattered minds
It's always a head game with you, Nick
You've never had a shot at any of this
So just smash your guitar
Smash your dreams
Grow up now is just what I mean
Its always a head case with you, Nick
You've never had a shot at any of this
So just smash your guitar
Smash your dreams
Grow up now is just what I mean, oh
Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean
Oh, fuck
(Well, we're here kids)
(No, daddy, no!)
