Song Name: U&ME
Summer holiday, having fun
Happiness is between two buns
Feeling funky on a rolling boil
Smiles bend all over, can't control how I feel
It's just you and me now
Round of Kimonos for my girls in the sun
Sending videos to friends in London
Strut like Stellan Skarsg√•rd to and from the bar
Playin' my candy tangerine Telecaster
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now

It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
Two hot palms pressing down on my face
Dragged by my sockets to a better place
Flashing in the dark, my luminescent tongue
Summer holiday, having fun
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
Ooh, I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
