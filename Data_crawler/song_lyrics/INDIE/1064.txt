Song Name: i was all over her
Don't know what I wanted, I have a memory
Back at that party, I was all over her
We didn't make out or do anything
I just remember I was lonely
I guess I am always, it's not a problem
It's just something, I got used to it
Every stranger makes me feel safer
And every person seems more beautiful
