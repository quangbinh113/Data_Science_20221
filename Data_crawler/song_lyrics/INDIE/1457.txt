Song Name: Hey Michael
I heard you're pretty good at drums
I think that's pretty cool
But if you try to fuck my pretty friend
I'll push you in the pool
You talk for so long about Mad Men
I've never seen that show
You don't gotta say you love Pulp Fiction
I already know
Hey Michael, you American psycho
Where the hell did my night go?
Should have seen all your red flags
Your tattoos look so bad
You're old for your friends
You're the life of the party
But the party is finally over
I think I'm gonna lose my shit
I'm gonna lose my composure
I think I wanna start a fight
Which one is your girlfriend?
This party has got no life
I think it's time for an end (end)
My band's about to hit it big
And pretty soon I won't have time
You think that I could bum a cig?
You got a light?
I forgot mine
I've got self-diagnosed ADHD
So if I catch you crying on my sidewalk
You can't blame me
Hey Michael, you American psycho
Where the hell did my night go?
Should have seen all your red flags
Your tattoos look so bad
You're old for your friends
You're the life of the party
But the party is finally over
I think I'm gonna lose my shit
I'm gonna lose my composure
I think I wanna start a fight
Which one is your girlfriend?
This party has got no life
I think it's time for an end
