Song Name: Honey
I like my girls just like I like my honey sweet
A little selfish
I like my women like I like my money green
A little jealous
'Cause I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone-cold neck, yeah, I'm charming
All the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
Heartache would stay with you
Fly great escapes with you
I countdown to the clock, saw you awake
Don't walk away, or would you wait for me?
I go out to the bar, fuck hangin' with the stars
Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me
All, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
My heartache would stay with you
Escape with you

I like my girls just like I like my honey sweet
A little selfish, huh
I like my women like I like my money green
A little jealous
Oh, I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone-cold neck, I'm so charming, oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do do-do
Da-da-da da-da
Do-do-do do-do
Isn't love all we need? Is it love?
Do-do-do do-do
The Beatles say prophecy is love
Do-do-do do-do
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti, is it love?
Do-do-do do-do
Love, do-do-do do-do
