Song Name: Good News
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleaning
I'm always too busy dreaming
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Well, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing
Get everything I need then I'm gone
But it ain't stealing, can I get a break?
I wish that I could just, get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time in the day
Maybe I'll lay down for a little
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh, it make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
So tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
So what I do? If you know me it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky is still blue
Heard they don't talk about me too much, no more
That's the problem with a closed door
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
When I'm flying oh, it make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
There's a whole lot more for me waiting on the other side
I'm always wondering, if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waiting
That there's a whole lot more for me waiting
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad
Ain't so bad
When it ain't that bad
At least it don't gotta be no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more
