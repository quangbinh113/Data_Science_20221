Song Name: Dance with Me
If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you
Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don't have to speak
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you
