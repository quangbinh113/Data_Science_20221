Song Name: We Get High
Hey
Sit back, watch how I let, I let it roll off, yeah
Days go bad, that's just how they get
Now add them all up, yeah
Feel good now, chin up and move by
Sometimes is nothing right
So when we get low
Woah, we get high
And we don't know how it goes
No one at our show
Our money's been getting tight
But when we get low
Woah, we get high, ha-ha-ha
I'm looking for the light at the end of the night
I light a match and watch it all burn down
Can't always be a good one
Everyone knows one
Where everything start going south, yeah
Feel good now, chin up and move by
Sometimes is nothing right
So when we get low
Woah, we get high
And we don't know how it goes
No one at our show
Our money's been getting tight
But when we get low
Woah, we get high, ha-ha-ha
Sit back, watch how I let, I let it roll off, yeah
Days go bad, that's just how they get
Now add them all up, yeah
Feel good now, chin up and move by
Sometimes is nothing right
So when we get low
Woah, we get high
And we get high
And we get high, oh-oh-oh
We get high
And we get high, we get
Woah, we get high, ha-ha-ha
Haha, skrr
