You said your favorite kinda weather is a rainy day
And it's raining in L.A
You said let's drive, I wanna take you to my favorite place
And it's not that far away
I know you're afraid of jumping in too fast
Because your heart is still healing
It'd be shame to waste the chemistry we have
So let's stay in the feeling and
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now
Even if we burn this down
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy now
My heart is begging not to let my head get in the way
And I think you feel the same
Scared I might be falling for you way too fast
Because my heart is still healing
But how can I say no when you've been look at me like that
So let's not overthink it and
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now
Even if we burn this down
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy now
And all that I know is here in this moment
Sun is still setting over the ocean
And you're still kissing me so
Can we just be happy
Here in this light, the green in your eyes is all that I see
I'm right where I wanna be so
Can we just be happy now
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
Can we just be happy now
Even if we burn this down
And we can't be friends
Can we just be happy
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now
Even if we burn this down
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy now
And all that I know is here in this moment
Sun is still setting over the ocean
And you're still kissing me so
Can we just be happy
Here in this light, the green in your eyes is all that I see
I'm right where I wanna be so
Can we just be happy now
Can we just be happy now
Can we just be happy now
Can we just be happy now
Can we just be happy now
