Song Name: What If
I'm
Just
Tryna
Figure it out
How
Would
I
Be without you?
If
There's
A kind
Of situation
That
Brings
Us
The disconnection
As you are
Far away
I've got so many
Questions that
What if
I could see
You there every sunrise?
Or what if
I couldn't see
You there every moonshine?
Would it
Be different from these confusions
Cause there's no any explanation
For awhile
Or what if
You and I
Better say goodbye
As you were
Far away
I've got so many
Questions that
What if
I could see
You there every sunrise?
Or what if
I couldn't see
You there every moonshine?
Would it
Be different from these confusions
Cause there's no any explanation
For awhile
Or what if
You and I
Better say goodbye
Whatever you'd say
It could change my world
By just your words
But could push me up and
It might pull me down
You could say it right now
That's fine anyway
Whatever you'd say
What if
I could see
You there every sunrise?
Or what if
I couldn't see
You there every moonshine?
Would it
Be different from these confusions
Cause there's no any explanation
For awhile
Or what if
You and I
Better say goodbye
