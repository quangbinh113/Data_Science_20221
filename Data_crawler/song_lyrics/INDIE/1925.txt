Song Name: Always Forever
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
Say you'll stay, never be severed
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
Heard you say things could be better
Darling, don't get a wandering eye
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down
Oh, darling, it's alarming to think of us apart
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we could settle down
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
