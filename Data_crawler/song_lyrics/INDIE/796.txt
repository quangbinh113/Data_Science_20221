Song Name: Worst in Me
I saw you standing there, and I knew
I'm done for, it's over, I'm through
Playing games from the start
Sinking your nails in my heart
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
Looking back in my rear view
Nothing, no nothing can change you
I decided to play when I knew you were fire
It started off warm and now I hear the choir
Who do you think you are?
Leaving your keys in my car
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
