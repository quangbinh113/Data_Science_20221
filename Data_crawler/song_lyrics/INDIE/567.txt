Song Name: Death Of A Strawberry
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation
And learned to live with a little sensation
Hey, just for the day, we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey, let's make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place
Swinging back and forth
All my faults are peaking past the surface
Is it worth it to fall back down?
Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent
We're way too caught up in the race with time
It's getting hard to take it in
We're trying hard to be the first in line
Just wanna be a kid again, a kid again
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
Over, over, overwhelmed again
Singin' out, out
Bury it away
Hey, just for the day, we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey, let's make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place
Killing all the flies, I'm not done swinging back and forth yet
Forgive me for what I will do
Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent
I know we trust each other; don't fail the litmus
We all need partners for the pain of existence
My bedroom chemistry set ended up on your Pinterest
Pledging allegiance to a few common interests
Claw my way to the top of the centipede
The sum of its parts is prescribing me symmetry
Every bone picked and decision was orchestrated
Cut the head off and the legs'll call the action complacent
