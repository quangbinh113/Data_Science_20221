Song Name: You're Gonna Live Forever in Me
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately
But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word in my seat
But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see
