Song Name: Violets
She don't want no roses
My baby wants violets
Said her heart is blue and mine is too
Her heart is blue and mine is too
That's how we like it
You got demons I can tell
You remind me of myself
You sure make it feel like heaven
For a match that made in hell
I don't usually get this far
Always end things 'fore they start
But you know every move I'm making
Cause you're playing the same cards
You feel your best when you're sad
You look your best in all black (goddamn)
Yeah, you a different type bad
She don't want no roses
My baby wants violets
She said her heart is blue and mine is too
That's how I like it
Beautifully broken
We don't got to hide it
She said her heart is blue and mine is too
Her heart is blue and mine is too
That's how we like it
That's how we like it, violets
You don't need me to love you and I don't need you to miss me
I'm not trying to save you, and you're not dying to fix me
You feel your best when you're sad
You look your best in all black (goddamn)
You a different type bad
She don't want no roses
My baby wants violets
She said her heart is blue and mine is too
That's how I like it
Beautifully broken
We don't got to hide it
She said her heart is blue and mine is too
Her heart is blue and mine is too
That's how we like it
