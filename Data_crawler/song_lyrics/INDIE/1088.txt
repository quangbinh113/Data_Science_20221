Song Name: Can I Call You Tonight?
I feel close
Well, maybe I'm not, heaven knows
It's a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things that I'm feeling?
There's so much time
For me to speak up, but I keep quiet
I'll complicate the most of the mantra
The power is out and I can't turn the fan on
So can I call you tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know
Voice so low
Sneaking around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Picking up things that I can fidget
Circle speed, pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo
I think that I might have to let you go
So can I call you tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know

Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, go
So can I call you tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know
