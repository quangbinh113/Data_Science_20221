Song Name: My Foolish Heart
The scene is set for dreaming
Love is knocking at the door
But oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start
'Cause we have been here before
The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the madness of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine
Take care, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love my foolish heart
Her lips are much too close to mine, take care
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, ah, it's love this time, it's love
This time, it's love my foolish heart
