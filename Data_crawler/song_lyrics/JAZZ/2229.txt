Song Name: Youâ€™re Driving Me Crazy
You, you're driving me crazy
What did I do? What did I do?
My tears for you, make everything hazy
Clouding the skies of blue
How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy
What did I do to you?
How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you
You, you're driving me crazy
What did I do to you?
