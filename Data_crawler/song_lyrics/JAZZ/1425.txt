Song Name: You Stepped out of a Dream - 2007 Remaster
You
Stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful
To be what you seem
Could there be eyes like yours?
Could there be lips like yours?
Could there be smiles like yours,
Honest and truly?
You
Stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away
Away from the crowd
And have you all to myself
Alone and apart
Out of a dream
Safe into my heart
You
Stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away
Away from the crowd
And have you all to myself
Alone and apart
Out of a dream
Safe into my heart ...
Wa-dee-la-la
Out of a dream!
