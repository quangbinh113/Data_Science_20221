Song Name: Shower Me With Your Love
My heart is filled
With so much love
And I need someone
I can call my own
To fall in love,
That's what everyone's
Dreaming of
I hold this feeling,
Oh, so strong
Life is too short
To live alone
Without someone
To call my own
I will care for you,
You will care for me
Our love
Will live forever
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
That I long for
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
I've been waiting for
I close my eyes
And pray all my wishes
Come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine,
I'll wait for you endlessly
Can't you see?
Fairy tales,
They do sometimes come true
If you believe It
Could happen to you
Like the stars that shine
Way up in the sky
Our love
Will live forever
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
That I long for
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
I've been waiting for
Like the stars that shine
Way up in the sky
Our love
Will live forever
(Live forever)
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
That I long for
Shower me
With your love
Shower me
With the love
I've been waiting for
