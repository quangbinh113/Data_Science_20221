Song Name: Itâ€™s Alright
Sealed my lips
Merceliss
With no shame I blame
Bring freeze in June, rain in May
Oh, now I see
Can't shake these memories
(You see, it ain't how it used to be)
How low of me
Dastardly
Thought I could hide
All I've been told, that I'd loose you both
Oh, now I see
How selfish I can be
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
Why did I push myself from between
The most beautiful ones I've ever seen
Was I aware that you'd care
Was I there
Such a loss
Like it or not
The two I see are all I need
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
Truly you see
You look right through me
I will show you nothing that I wouldn't do
Truly you see
You look right through me
I will show you nothing that I wouldn't do
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
To make it right, but it's alright
I keep on fighting, I keep fighting
It's alright, it's alright
