Song Name: Virtual Insanity - Remastered
Ooo Heh heh, Oh, what we're living in, let me tell ya
It is a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, It's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Now there is no sound if we all live underground
If there was virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
As a man-made man, oh yeah, I know yeah
Ooh
I know what can go wrong
Ooh, of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change
Yeah, things will never be the same
And it can go wrong, while we're living in
Ooh, ooh, virtual insanity
Ooh, this world has got to change
Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
Now vrtual insanity is what it is
Yeah
Ooh
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless, twisting, of the new technology
Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Now this life that we live in
It's so wrong
Shout out the window
Do you know that
There is nothing worse than a man-made man
Still there's nothing worse than a foolish man, hey
Virtual insanity is what we're living in
Yeah, it is alright
