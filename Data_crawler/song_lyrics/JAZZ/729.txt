Song Name: Miss You
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Hm hm hm hm, yeah
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
Been staring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
Just some friends of mine that says
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah, yeah
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Hm hm hm hm, hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm, yeah
Ooh, baby, why you wait so long?
Ooh, baby, why you wait so long?
Don't you? Come on, come on
Wanna move to walk, to walk, to walk
While I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
People ask me
"What's the matter with you girl?"
(Hey, what's the matter girl?) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(I'm here with some Puerto Rican friend) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(That are just dying to meet you) Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(We will bring that case of wine) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Let's make some fool around) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Like we used to) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Ooh, baby, why you wait so long?
Ooh, baby, why you wait so long?
Don't you? Come on, come on
(I guess I'm lying to myself) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(It's just you and no one else) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Lord, I miss you) Ooh ooh ooh ooh
To walk, to walk
(You've been fooling with my mind) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Messing with my time) Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Oh, I miss you, baby, yeah) Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Lord, I miss you child)
(Lord, I miss you child)
(Hm hm hm hm, hm hm hm)
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah)
(Hm hm hm hm)
