Song Name: She Chose Me
Not much to talk to, I know how I look
What I know about life comes out of a book
But of all of the people there are in the world
She chose me
Most of my life I've been on my own
Whatever I did, I did it alone
And then she came along, now I'm not alone
Since she chose me
Every night I thank the lucky stars above me
Someone as beautiful as she could freely love me
And she really loves me
From time to time I ask myself
Why was it I and nobody else?
The most beautiful girl that I'd ever seen
And she chose me
And she really loves me
From time to time I ask myself
Why was it I and not someone else?
The most beautiful girl in all of the world
And she chose me
