Song Name: Heart & Soul
Come my love, come and shine with your light on me
Come and play with the chimes in the belfry
Come with me and hold me in your arms
Let me feel your tenderness and your warmth
When the rain is falling hard
And the storm is far from over
My lady love, that's you
You give me warmth in the night
You take away my sadness
My lady darling it's true
I give my world to you
Let me show you how
Let me show you now
I long to hear your voice 'neath the night forlorn
And to gaze for a while into your eyes reborn
On my mind sometimes gets weak and cold
You'll remain like a song in my heart & soul
When the rain is falling hard
And the storm is far from over
My lady love, that's you
You give me warmth in the night
You take away my sadness
My lady darling it's true
I give my world to you
Let me show you how
Let me show you now
