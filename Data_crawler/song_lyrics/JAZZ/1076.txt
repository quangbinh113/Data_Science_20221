Song Name: Supermassive Black Hole
Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?
You set my soul alight
You set my soul alight
(You) Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul alight)
(You) glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul)
I thought I was a fool for no one
But mmh, baby I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth?
You set my soul alight
You set my soul alight
(You) Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul alight)
(You) glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul)
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(You) Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul alight)
(You) Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (Set my soul)
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
