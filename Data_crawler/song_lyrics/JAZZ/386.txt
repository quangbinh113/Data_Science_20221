Song Name: Hey Mama (feat. Nicki Minaj, Bebe Rexha & Afrojack)
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Yes, I be your woman
Yes, I be your baby
Yes, I be whatever that you tell me when you ready
Yes, I be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't never gotta worry
I'm down for you, baby
Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it
Beating my drum like dum di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Banging the drum like dum di-di-day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Yes, I do the cooking
Yes, I do the cleaning
Plus, I keep the na-na real sweet for your eating
Yes, you be the boss, and yes, I be respecting
Whatever that you tell me
'Cause it's game you be spitting, oh
Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it
Beating my drum like dum di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Banging the drum like dum di-di-day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Whole crew got the juice yo' game the truth
My screams is the proof them other dudes get the deuce
So when I speed in the coupe, leaving this interview
It ain't nothin' new I been f---in' with you
None of them b----s ain't taking you
Just tell 'em to make a U, huh
That's how it be, I come first like debut, huh
So, baby, when you need that
Give me the word, I'm no good
I'll be bad for my baby
So I make sure that he's getting his share
So I make sure that his baby take care
So I make sure I'm on my toes, on my knees
Keep him pleased, rub him down
Be a lady and a freak, oh
Beating my drum like dum di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Banging the drum like dum di-di-day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl, and I'll be your man
