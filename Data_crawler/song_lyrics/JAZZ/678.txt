Song Name: Path of Nothing
C'est toujours la même chose avec toi
Pas moyen d'y échapper
Dire qu'on s'était promis d'y croire
Et pas seulement d'en rêver
If we really think about
All the things we've never tried
I'd better go
And if we really doubt about
In the dark we'll spread the light
You'd better go
Does it really mean
We've lost our mind
I'll straigh to
Does it really mean
I've lost our time
How dare you
Confusion
God of our mind
Here to spend some quiet nights
I don't want to wake her
I don't want to wake her
Night will fall
On our playground
Early distance
Committed no crime
I don't want to wake her
I don't want to wake her
Does it really mean
You know
I'll straigh to
Does it really mean
Oh no
I won't tell you
I won't tell you
I don't want to wake her
I don't want to wake her
No matter how
We've toss the dice
No matter
Signs we're gonna find
I'd better go
The heat is oppressive and dry
In our souls illusion time
You'd better know
Does it really mean
We've lost our mind
I'll straigh to
Does it really mean
I've lost our time
How dare you
Confusion
God of our mind
Here to spend some quiet nights
I don't want to wake her
I don't want to wake her
Night will fall
On our playground
Early distance
Committed no crime
I don't want to wake her
I don't want to wake her
Does it really mean
You know
I'll straigh to
Does it really mean
Oh no
I won't tell you
I won't tell you
And so we walk on the path of the tears
And so we walk on the path of nothing
And so we walk on the path of the tears
And so we walk on the path of nothing
Of nothing, of nothing
