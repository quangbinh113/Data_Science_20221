Song Name: Can't Get Out of This Mood
Can't get out of this mood
Can't get over this feeling
Just can't get out of this mood
Last night, your lips were too appealing
And the thrill should've been all gone by today
In the usual way, but it's only your arms I'm out of
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you
It wasn't part of my scheme
To sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm saying it, and I'm playing it dumb
Can't get out of this mood
Heartbreak here I come
Can't get out of this mood
Can't get over this feeling
Just can't get out of this mood
Last night, your lips were too appealing
And the thrill should've been all gone by today
In the usual way, but it's only your arms I'm out of
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you
It wasn't part of my scheme
To sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm saying it, and I'm playing it dumb
Can't get out of this mood
Heartbreak here I come
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you
It wasn't part of my scheme
To sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm saying it, and I'm playing it dumb
Can't get out of this mood
Can't get out of this mood
Can't get out of this mood
Heartbreak here I come
Can't get out of this mood, woo
