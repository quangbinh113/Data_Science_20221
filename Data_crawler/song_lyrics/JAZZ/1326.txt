Song Name: You?
Girl (girl, girl)
Don't tell me your problems (Problems, problems)
I don't wanna solve them (Solve them, solve them)
I don't really care (I don't really care)
And you had a lot on your mind now (your mind now)
Your mind, (your mind) it's true (Your mind)
So tell me the truth, was it me then (me then)
Who needed you? (You)
Who needed you
Girl (girl, girl)
I'm twistin' and turnin' (I'm Twistin' and turnin')
This room here is burnin' (This room here is burnin')
There's smoke in the air (There's smoke in the air)

And you had a lot on your mind now (your mind now)
Your mind, (your mind) it's true (Your mind)
So tell me the truth, was it me then (me then)
Who needed you? (You)
Who needed you
Who needed you
Tear me to pieces
Why is the time so slow?
Don't got no reasons
Everything I don't know
Tell me you need it
Tell me to take it home
All that I'm thinkin'
Wonderin' where we'll go (go)
Who needed you
Who needed you
