Song Name: It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)
It don't mean a'thing, if it ain't got that swing
Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop,
It don't mean a'thing, all you got ta'do is sing
Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop,
It makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm every thing you got
It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a'thing, if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a'thing, all you got ta'do is sing
Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop,
It makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm every thing you got
It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop, Do Wop
