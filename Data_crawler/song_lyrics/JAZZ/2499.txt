Song Name: So In Love
Strange dear, but true dear
When I'm close
To you dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love, with you, am I
Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling why
So in love with you am I
In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with the joy delirious
Oh when I knew, mm, that you could care
So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me and desert me
I'm yours until I die
Said so in love
So in love
So in love with you am I
Mmm my love
So haunt me and hurt me
You deceive me
Ohh yeah desert me
I'm yours until I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you am I
My love
