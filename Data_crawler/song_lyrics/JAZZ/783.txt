Song Name: Mind Trick
I missed the opportunity
To get you, babe, to stay with me
Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made
Like a song, it will fade
If there's music in the night and it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need
It intoxicates your mind all your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead
It's not just me who feels it, music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you, oh oh
So I put my feelings out to dry
Love, one day again I'll have to try
Falling out, making up it seems such a silly game
Why do I never gain?
If there's music in the night and it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need
It intoxicates your mind all your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead
It's not just me who feels it music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you, oh oh
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, na, na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, na, na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, na, na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, na, na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, na, na
Na na na, na na na
Na na
If there's music in the night and it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need
It intoxicates your mind all your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead
It's not just me who feels it music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you (Na na na, na na na, na na na na na)
Watch me forget about missing you (Na na na, na na na, na na na na na)
Na na na na
