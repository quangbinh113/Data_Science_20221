Song Name: Body and Soul
For you, I sigh, for you, dear only
Why haven't you seen it, I'm all for you
Body and soul
I spend my days in longing
Wondering why it's me that you're wronging
I tell, you I mean it, I'm all for you
Body and soul
I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away, romance
Are you pretending, it looks like the ending
Unless, I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck, you're making
You know, I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you
Body and soul
Are you pretending, it looks like the ending
Unless, I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck, you're making
You know I'm yours for just the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you
Body and soul
