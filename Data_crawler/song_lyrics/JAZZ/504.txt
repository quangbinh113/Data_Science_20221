Song Name: Take On Me
Nananananana Talking away, I dont know what I'm to say I'll say it anyway, Today is another day, to find you, shine away, I'll be coming for you love okay, take all of me.
Take me all.
I'll be gone, in a day or two.
So needless to say, I'm ordinary, but that's me.
Stumbling away, slowly learning that life is okay.
Say after me, it's no better to be safe than sorry.
Take all me.
Take me all.
I'll be gone, in a day or two.
The things that you say, is life or just a clean my worries away, youre all the things I got to remember.
You shine away, I'll be coming for you anyway.
Take all me.
Oh you take me all.
In a day or two.
Nanananananana.
