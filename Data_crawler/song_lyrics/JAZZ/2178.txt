Song Name: Bidin My Time
Some fellows love to tiptoe through the tulips
Some fellows go on singing in the rain
Some fellows keep on painting skies with sunshine
Some fellows must go swinging down the lane
But I'm bidin' my time
'Cause that's the kind of guy I'm
While other folks grow dizzy
I keep busy
Bidin' my time
Next year, next year
Somethin's bound to happen
This year, this year
I'll just keep on mappin'
And bidin' my time
'Cause that's the kind of guy I'm
There's no regrettin'
When I'm settin'
Bidin' my time
I'm bidin' my time
'Cause that's the kind of guy I'm
Beginnin' on a Monday
Right through Sunday
Bidin' my time
Give me, give me
Glass that's bright and twinkles
Let me, let me
Dream like Rip Van Winkle
He's bided his time
Like that Winkle guy
I'm chasin' 'way flies
How the day flies
Bidin' my time
