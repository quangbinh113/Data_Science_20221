Song Name: Bad Boy (feat. Luana Kiara)
Rolled up sleeves yeah
24k smile to match his red eyes
Commas in his hair and a
Chain with a saint, but he ain't none
Inked up neck and the
Letters on his fingers speak of trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Don't go flexing boy, you'll get trouble
Oh, bad boy, messing with the boom boom
Oh, bad boy, riding on the vroom vroom
Oh, bad boy, bad boy, hah
Bad boy, bad boy, hah
Oh, bad boy, messing with the boom boom
Oh, bad boy, riding on the vroom vroom
Oh, bad boy, bad boy, hah
Bad boy, bad boy, hah
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Messing with the boom boom, riding on the vroom vroom
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, on that boom boom
Messing with the boom boom, riding on the vroom vroom
Rolled up sleeves and he's
Coming on hard
He's gonna hurt the ones he loves
'Cause no savage can be trusted, no, no, no
Eh, riding lambos, hitting bandos, yeah, yeah
Trapping and hustle, trouble trouble (trouble trouble)
Don't go flexing boy, you'll get trouble
Oh, bad boy, messing with the boom boom
Oh, bad boy, riding on the vroom vroom
Oh, bad boy, bad boy, hah
Bad boy, bad boy, hah
Oh, bad boy, messing with the boom boom
Oh, bad boy, riding on the vroom vroom
Oh, bad boy, bad boy, hah
Bad boy, bad boy, hah

Na-na-naughty na-na-naughty, ba-ba-ba, boom boom
