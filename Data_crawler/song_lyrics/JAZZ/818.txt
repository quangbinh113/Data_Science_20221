Song Name: Myamy
You're my queen of punk, you're the best of fuck, you're turning all the trash into a piece of jazz,
You're making me sick, but I have to admit: I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling in love...
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
You're so jazzy, you're so trashy, you're so retro, you're like the signs in the metro??
You're my princess of sleaze, listen to my confession please...
I give my brain an evening off and listen to your stuff???
Your face undoubted my thought cause you give me hope???
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
You're getting dressed like a widow cause you don't hate yourself in the morning cause you sleep till noon,
And you say rehabs for quitters and for shitters
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
Amy, my Amy, don't blame me for falling in love
