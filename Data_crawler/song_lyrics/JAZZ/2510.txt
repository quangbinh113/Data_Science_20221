Song Name: I Just Couldn't Stand It No More
When I was trying... When I was trying...
Everything I could to satisfy him...
When I won't lookin
When I won't Lookin...
Some no good woman came and took him!
I had to cry... cause I just couldn't stand it no more!
I seen them walkin
I seen them walkin...
Holding hands and a talking!
I seen them kissing...
Yes, they was kissing!
Then I knew just what I would be missin!
I had to cry... cause I just couldn't stand it no more!
Well I'm standing... and crying
Just thinking and crying...
Watching the man that use to be mine... oh yes!
My heart is aching, My heart is aching,
He don't know how much it is a breaking
I need somebody, yes I need someboyd
To take my love and help me to forget him...
I had to cry, Lord, I just couldn't stand it no more!
Well I'm standing... and crying
Just thinking and crying...
Watching the man that use to be mine... oh yes!
Finish out ...with,
I just couldn't stand it no more
I just couldn't stand it no more
I just couldn't stand it no more
