Song Name: I Cover the Waterfront
Away from the city, that hurts and mocks
I stand alone, by the desolate docks
In the still and the chill of the night
I see the horizon, the great unknown
My heart has an ache, it's a heavy as stone
Will the dawn, comin' on, make it light?
I cover the waterfront
I'm watchin' the sea
Will the one I love
Be comin' back to me
I cover the waterfront
In search of my love
And I'm covered by
The starlit sky above
Here I am
Patiently waiting
Hopin' and prayin'
Lord, how I yearn
Well are you
Are you forgettin'
I hope you're rememberin'
When you return
I cover the waterfront
I'm watchin' the sea
Oh you're the one that I love
Must soon come back to me
Well are you
Are you forgettin'
I hope you're rememberin'
Will you return
I cover the waterfront
I'm watchin' the sea
For the one I love
Must soon come back to me
