Song Name: Let The Music Play
Could I have a ticket please
Oh everybody here, everybody here
No he's at home, he's at home
Let the music play
Cause I just wanna dance this night away
Right here is where i'm gonna stay
All night long
Let the music play on
Just until i feel this misery is gone
Moving, kicking, grooving, keep the music strong
On and on and on and on
Let it play on and on
Let it play on and on
And on and on yeah
Im out here dancing but still
I can't erase these things I feel
This tender love we used to say
It's like its not longer there
I've got to hide what's killing me inside
Let the music play cause I just wanna dance the night away
Right here is where i'm gonna stay
All night long
Let the music play on
Just until i feel this misery is gone
Moving, kicking, grooving, keep the music strong
On and on and on and on
Let it play on and on
Let it play on and on
And on and on yeah
Let the music play
And on and on and on yeah yeah
Im out here dancing but still
I can't erase these things I feel
This tender love we used to say
It's like its not longer there
I've got to hide what's killing me inside
Let the music play cause I just wanna dance the night away
It's where I'm gonna stay
All night long
Let the music play
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Moving, kicking, grooving, keep the music strong
Let it play on and on and on and on
Keep that music strong, let the music play
