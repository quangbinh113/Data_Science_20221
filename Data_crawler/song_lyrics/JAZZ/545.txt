Song Name: Give Me the Night - Chill Night Mix
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
'Til the day is dawning
We can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night, give me the night
Gimme the night, give me the night
You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
We'll see the people of the world coming out to dance
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night, give me the night
And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street 'til the morning light
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night, give me the night
Gimme the night, give me the night
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night, give me the night
Gimme the night, give me the night
