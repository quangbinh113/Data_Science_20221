Song Name: GLOW
I could wait a thousand days
You never wait for me
Even when I ran away
You were all that I could see
When I could hardly walk on my own
I had to lift myself out of the trench below
How then I suffered enough to let you go?
Let you go, let you go now
You love me right for a minute
Even though I try so hard to forget it
All you do is pave the way, so I could reinvent myself
You can watch me glow
You can watch me glow
I could wait a thousand days
You never wait for me
Even when I ran away
You were all that I could see
When I could hardly walk on my own
I had to lift myself out of the trench below
How then I suffered enough to let you go?
Let you go, let you go now
You love me right for a minute
Even though I try so hard to forget it
All you do is pave the way, so I could reinvent myself
You can watch me glow
You can watch me glow
