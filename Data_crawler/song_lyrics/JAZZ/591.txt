Song Name: No I Ain't
I'm looking for a place to hide,
It seems we're crossing a line.
My love for you is making me blind,
But I want you, oh I want you.
I think we're out of control,
It feels like I'm losing ground.
I know we had it all,
Now I'm chasing, oh I'm chasing.
No I ain't going too far,
I will love you where ever you are.
Even if my spot, you are the light in my dark.
I think we're out of control,
It feels like I'm losing ground.
I know we had it all,
Now I'm chasing, oh I'm chasing.
No I ain't going too far,
I will love you where ever you are.
Even if my spot, you are the light in my dark.
Oh no.
No I ain't going too far,
I will love you where ever you are.
Even if my spot, you are the light in my dark.
So I start looking at me.
Tear drops, falling free.
Now I am facing fear.
We both know, that our love is ending.
It's time to say goodbye.
Even if you're far away, we should give it another try.
No I ain't going too far,
I will love you where ever you are.
Even if my spot, you are the light in my dark.
Oh no.
You are the light in my dark.
