Song Name: flaws
If I showed you my flaws
Would you run away
Or would you stay
If I showed you my scars
Would I have a chance
A chance at romance
I know
You said that you'd stick around and
I hope you're right
Lets go slow
I am still having doubts cause
I've failed many tries
Is she really gonna stay?
I'm too scared to think that right now
Will you tell her everything?
At some point it all just comes out
Is it gonna be okay?
I don't really know so I'm asking
Oh I'm asking
If I showed you my flaws
Would you run away
Or would you stay
If I showed you my scars
Would I have a chance
A chance at romance
With you
With you
Wanna tell you my secrets
Hoping you'll keep them to yourself
I know you're something different
You make feel things I've never felt
Is she really gonna stay?
I'm too scared to think that right now
Will you tell her everything?
At some point it all just comes out
Is it gonna be okay?
I don't really know so I'm asking
Oh I'm asking
If I showed you my flaws
Would you run away
Or would you stay
If I showed you my scars
Would I have a chance
A chance at romance
With you
Give
Give me a chance
Chance at romance
Give me a chance
