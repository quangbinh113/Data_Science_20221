Song Name: Honeymoon
I live a lifetime every moment
When I'm holding you close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
Honey, I won't ever let go
Because you pulled me like a magnet
Now, I'm right where I belong
I'm gonna love you the same for the rest of my days
And on, and on, and on
'Cause as long as we keep dancing
We'll stay young at heart
And every time I hold you in my arms
You give me deja vu
Like l've been waiting my whole life to find that view
'Cause when I'm lookin' at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you, baby, everyday's a honeymoon
Oh-oh, it's a honeymoon
Baby, everyday's a honeymoon
I wanna spend some time in Paris
Serenade you on the beach
We'll take a picture for our parents
But we're never gonna leave
Nobody knows you like I know you
Nobody loves you like I do
And if I'm never a star, but I've got my guitar
I'll be singing songs to you
'Cause as long as we keep dancing
We'll stay young at heart
And every time I hold you in my arms
You give me deja vu
Like l've been waiting my whole life to find that view
'Cause when I'm lookin' at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you, baby, everyday's a honeymoon
Oh-oh, it's a honeymoon
Baby, everyday's a honeymoon
Maybe we'll end up in New York city
Maybe we'll end up out in L.A
Maybe we'll decide to stay right here forever after
I will love you all the same
You give me deja vu
Like l've been waiting my whole life to find that view
'Cause when I'm lookin' at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you, baby, everyday's a honeymoon
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, it's a honeymoon
Oh-oh-oh
Baby everyday's a honeymoon with you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, it's a honeymoon
If I got you, baby, everyday's a honeymoon
