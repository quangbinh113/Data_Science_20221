Song Name: The Times They Are A-Changin' - Outtake
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
For your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
The old road is rapidly fading
Please get out of our way now
If you can't lend a hand
For the times they are a-changin'
