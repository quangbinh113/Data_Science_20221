Song Name: Can't Help the Way That I Feel - David Penn Remix - Radio Edit
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't, I just can't
'Cause I can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
'Cause I can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
'Cause I can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
'Cause I can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't, I just can't
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't, I just can't
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel (I just can't)
