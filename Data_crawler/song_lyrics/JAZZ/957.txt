Song Name: Night Out - Original Mix
Put on your shoes
I wear my best looking suit
A silk satin tie
We're gonna fly high
A night out
A night out
A sharp looking dress
But you under arrest
Everybody shall see
That you belong to me
A night out
Night out
You ready?
S'up madam
Yeah
Your high class perfume
Fills up the room
Like all the big girls
You wear diamonds and pearls
That grand belly tour
And the bamboo river
Your champagne smile
It will last for a while
Night out
Yeah, night out
A night out
Night out
Yeah, night out
A night out
