Song Name: Stay This Way
Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole world? s on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
Feeling the sun on my head
Where a cloud used to follow instead
Singing a song in my heart
In a place where all my troubles depart
If our dreams are falling down to the ground
Let them fly
Let the rain keep falling down
'Cause baby I? m high
Now it will fly
Now that we? re together
Love is so high
Stay this way forever
With you in my life
Is like feeling the whole world? s on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
If our dreams are falling down to the ground
Let them fly
Let the rain keep falling down
'Cause baby I? m high
Now it will fly
Now that we? re together
Love is so high
Stay this way forever
Our love, yeah yeah
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we? ll stay together
Our love will be here forever
If we? ll stay together
