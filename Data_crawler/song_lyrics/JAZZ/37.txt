Song Name: Icarus
I flew too high
Left fear on the ground
I touched the sky
And never looked down
You were the light I couldn't resist
And I asked for love
But I asked amiss
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
Now look at the state of us
What have we done?
(We're far too gone)
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
You shone so bright
You gave me hope
You knew that I couldn't ignore
I gave love a try
Love tried me with fire
I flew too high
Such is desire
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
Now look at the state of us
What have (what have) we done? (We done?)
(We're far too gone)
I loved you as Icarus
Loved the sun
(Too close, too much)
I flew too high
Please catch my fall
I flew too high
Please catch my fall
I flew too high (I flew too high)
Please catch my fall (please catch my fall)
I flew too high (I flew too high)
Please catch my fall
I flew too high (I flew too high)
Please catch my fall (please catch my fall)
I flew too high (I flew too high)
Please catch my fall (please catch my fall)
I flew too high (I flew too high)
Please catch my fall (please catch my fall)
I flew too high
Please catch my fall
