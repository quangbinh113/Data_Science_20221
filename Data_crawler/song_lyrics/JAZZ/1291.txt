Song Name: I Want It
I think that I want it
It's all I really need
You say that you want it
Just tell it straight to me
I think that I want it
It's all I really need
You say that you want it
Just tell it straight to me
(I think that I want it)
(I want it, I want it, I want it)
(You say that you want it)
(Yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah)
I think that I want it
It's all I really need
You say that you want it
Just tell it straight to me
I gotta be with you forever, ooh, ooh, ah
You say we can drink till September, ooh, ooh, ah
I think that I want it
It's all I really need
You say that you want it
Just tell it straight to me
I think that I want it
It's all I really need
You say that you want it
Just tell it straight to me
I think that I want it
I think that I want it
I think that I want it
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
