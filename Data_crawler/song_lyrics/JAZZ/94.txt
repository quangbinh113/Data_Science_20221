Song Name: Fly You to the Moon
I'll Fly You to the Moon
A place for me and you
Tell me what you wanna do
I wanna take you to the moon

Can I take you? Yeah
I sing you this lullaby
Oh close your eyes
And listen to my heart beat yeah
Something about you girl makes me wonder
What you doin' tonight
I'll Fly You to the Moon
A place for me and you
Tell me what you wanna do

I wanna take you to the moon
Oh oh
Two, yeah
Where it's peace and quiet (Peace and quiet)
There's nowhere else to go (There's nowhere else to go)
Yeah, I got your arms around me (I got your arms around me)
While we're floating in the air (Floating on the air)
There's nobody else there (There's nobody else there)
I'll Fly You to the Moon

A place for me and you
Tell me what you wanna do
I wanna take you to moon
Oh ooh ooh oh, yeah
Can I take you to the moon?
I'll Fly You to the Moon yeah
Can I take you to the moon babe
I'll Fly You to the Moon (Fly You to the Moon)
A place for me and you (Place for me and you)
Tell me what you wanna do (Tell me what you wanna do)
I wanna take you to the moon
Oh oh ooh
