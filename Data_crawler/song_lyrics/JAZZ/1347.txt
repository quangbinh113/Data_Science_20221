Song Name: Love You
Lipstick stain in the water
Six sad sips from the wine
Wasted on occasion
With the lights on and I face it
Does the fact that I'm yours or you're mine
I don't wanna sing sad songs forever
I don't want to, but maybe I might
I tried to erase him, to replace him
I forgave him and he's back right to my arms tonight
The sun will always go down (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The sky will always be blue (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you
Love the taste of all the bitches
Seven sad sips of the wine
Wasted on occasion
And the cry says I'm amazing
'Cause I leave and you remain here in my mind
I don't wanna sing sad songs forever
I don't want to, but maybe I might
I tried to erase him, to replace him
I forgave him and he's back right to my arms tonight
The sun will always go down (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The sky will always be blue (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you
And I cried so many times
To find the peace of mind
Look me in the eye
Oh, my, oh
The sun will always go down (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The sky will always be blue (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And, and as hard as I pray to change it
As much as I hate to say this
I, I, I, I will always love you
