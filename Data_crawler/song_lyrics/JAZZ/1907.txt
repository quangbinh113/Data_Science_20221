Song Name: I Wanna Be Around (with Ricardo Arjona)
I want to be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I
Yo quiero estar ahí
Para saber que hay alguien
Que te hace justo lo que tú a mí
Sentarme a observar tus lagrimas caer
Para mi placer
I mean, I want to be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine
Y ver como caen al suelo
Tus sueños
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
Y verte en mi butaca en primera fila
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine
