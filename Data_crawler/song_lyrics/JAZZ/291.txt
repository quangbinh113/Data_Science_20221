Song Name: Beethoven
If you, if you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (with the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes, Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots
If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (and the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes, Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots
I've, I've been running 'round the city on the same thing
Got the city locked, I see why I'm in the chain gang
Reach for my neck, I'ma make it go "Bang, bang"
They don't really want me, they just want me for my ding-a-ling
Style with no stylist, ride with no mileage
She giving me brain like she just finished college
I'm just being honest, I don't carry wallets
The bands in my hands can't fit in my pockets
Rich bitch take dick, that's my type
Simp with the blue strips, that's what I like
You know I'm a big dawg, but I don't bite
Done helping niggas out, I ain't finna ghost-write
It's a miracle, niggas tryna be lyrical
Town have the general, eating niggas like dinner roast
Niggas making it difficult, effort I give it minimal
All you niggas disposable, diamonds looking invisible
If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (with the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes, Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots
If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (and the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes, Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots
