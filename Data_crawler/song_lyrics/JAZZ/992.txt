Song Name: Cut for My Condition
Keep me level on a high
Breath into me, I'm alive
Got me begging for the ride
So I'll live for
You touch my soul
Can't let you go
So I'll live for this
Live for this
Live for this
Live for
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
Take me up from them high skies
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Ooh
Give it cut for my condition
Ooh
Yeah, give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
That aching
Cold shaking
I'm taking
What you're making
Near breaking
But I'll live for this
Live for this
Live for
You touch my soul
Can't let you go
So I'll live for this
Live for this
Live for this
Live for
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
Take me up from them high skies
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Ooh
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Ooh, yeah
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
That aching
Cold shaking
I'm taking
What you're making
Near breaking
But I'll live for this
Live for this
Live for
That aching
Cold shaking
I'm taking
What you're making
(Near breaking)
(But I'll live for this)
(Live for this)
(Live for)
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
Take me up from them high skies
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Ooh
Give it cut for my condition
Oh, it's my condition
Ooh
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
Cut for my condition
(It's my condition)
Give it cut for my condition
It's my condition
It's my condition
