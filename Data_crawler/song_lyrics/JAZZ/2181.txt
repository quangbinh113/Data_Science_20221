Song Name: Say It Isn't So
You can't stop people from talking
And they're talking, my dear
And the things they're saying
Fill my heart with fear
Now I could never believe them
When they say you're untrue
I know that they're mistaken
Still I want to hear it from you
Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Everyone is saying you don't love me
Say it isn't so
Everywhere I go, everyone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so
People say that you
Found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it isn't true
Say that everything is still okay
That's all I want to know
And what they're saying
Say it isn't so
