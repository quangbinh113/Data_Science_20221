Song Name: Last Nite
Last night she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down"
"Oh, it turn' me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen, oh, minutes now
Oh baby, I feel so down, and I don't know why
I keep walking for miles
And see, people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down"
"Oh, it turn' me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie, 'cause I left that night, yeah
Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down"
"See, it turn' me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door, yeah
