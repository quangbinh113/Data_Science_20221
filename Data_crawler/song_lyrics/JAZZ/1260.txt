Song Name: Ghost
Young blood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life
Young blood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (whoa)
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-yeah-yeah
More than life, oh
So if I can't get close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life
