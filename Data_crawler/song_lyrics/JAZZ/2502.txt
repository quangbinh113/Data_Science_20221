Song Name: I Understand
I understand
And darling you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
No it's not your fault
Because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you
Maybe far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill
And no one can fill your place
Here in my arms
What if you find
Our love was really meant to be
Then daddy hurry home to me
And I'll understand, yes, oh yes
Baby I'll understand
