Song Name: Often - Kygo Remix
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious (so vicious)
My God white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (baby)
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, oh
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man, it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bi-bi-bitch down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that, make that rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it (often)
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Na-na-na-na (do it how I want to)
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bi-bi-bitch down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that, make that rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it
Often
Pop, pop, pop (baby, baby)
Pop, pop, pop (do it how I want it, baby, baby)
Pop, pop, pop (baby, baby)
Pop, pop, pop (often)
Pop, pop, pop (baby, baby)
Pop, pop, pop (do it how I want it)
Pop, pop, pop
(Do it how I want it)
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bi-bi-bitch down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that, make that rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pop-pop and do it how I want it
Often
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (do it how I want it)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na (do it how I want it)
