Song Name: Sing
Baby
You've been going so crazy
Lately
Nothing seems to be going right
So low
Why do you have to get so low
You're so
You've been waiting in the sun too long
But if you Sing, Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
For the love you bring
Won't mean a thing
Unless you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing
Colder
Crying over your shoulder
Hold her
And tell her everything's gonna be fine
Surely
You've been going too early
Hurry 'cause no one's gonna be stopped
Na na na na na
But if you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
For the love you bring
Won't mean a thing
Unless you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
Baby
There's something going on today
But I say
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
It's all na na na na na
But if you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
For the love you bring
Won't mean a thing
Unless you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
Oh baby Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
For the love you bring
Won't mean a thing
Unless you Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing
