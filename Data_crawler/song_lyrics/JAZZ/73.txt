Song Name: across the room
I've thought about that night from all the angles
Feels like a million ways
I had to know your name
Remember being glad you came
You're the kind of love I could get high on
Never been the girl you could rely on
Tried to run away from where you are
Then you
Baby, you
Captivating from across the room
You are my love
Then you
Baby, you
Love me despite all I put you through
You are my love
But I'm still afraid
Baby will you comfort me?
I'll let you hold my shame, will you help me find my way? (Yeah)
And you're the love I can get high on
Never been a girl you can rely on
Tried to run away from where you are
Then you
Baby, you
Captivating from across the room
You are my love
Then you
Baby, you
Love me despite all I put you through
You are my love
