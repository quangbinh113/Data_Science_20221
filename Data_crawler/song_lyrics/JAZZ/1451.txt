Song Name: I Could Write A Book
If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper
And look.
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget.
And the simple
Secret of the plot
Is just to tell them
That I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers
As my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends
