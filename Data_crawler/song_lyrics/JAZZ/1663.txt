Song Name: Softly as in a Early Morning Sunrise
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
A vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And take you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let it fall to hell
So ends the story
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
A vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And take you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let it fall to hell
So ends the story
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away
