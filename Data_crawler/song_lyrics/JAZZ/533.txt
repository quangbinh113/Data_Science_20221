Song Name: Dreaming Of You
Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star
That somewhere you are thinking of me too
'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow
I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming about you and me
Wonder if you ever see me (see me)
And I wonder if you know I'm there (am I there? Am I?)
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?
I just wanna hold you close
But so far
All I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day and the courage to say
How much I love you, yes I do!
I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow
I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming about you and me
Coraz칩n
(I can't stop dreaming of you)
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
(I can't stop dreaming)
C칩mo te necesito
(I can't stop dreaming of you)
Mi amor (c칩mo te extra침o)
Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe
That you came up to me
And said, "I love you"
I love you too!
Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow ('til tomorrow) and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming with you endlessly (dreaming with you, tonight)
With you tonight (I want you to know I'll be holding you tight)
And there's nowhere in the world where I'd rather be
Than here in my room
I'll be dreaming (endlessly) of you tonight (endlessly)
And I'll be holding you tight ('til tomorrow)
Dreaming with you tonight (endlessly, endlessly)
Dreaming (endlessly)
