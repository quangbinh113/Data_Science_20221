Song Name: Blue Moon
Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Not a love of my own
Blue Moon, you knew just what I was there for
You had me saying, pray for someone I really could care for
And then it suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I had somebody wished, please adore me
When I look to the Moon and it turned to gold
Blue Moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own!
And then it suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I had somebody wished, please adore me
When I look to the Moon and it turned to gold
Blue Moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own!
Without a love of my own!
Without a love of my own!
