Song Name: My Life Is Going On (MÃºsica Original De La Serie De TV La Casa De Papel / Money Heist)
If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now
But I'm winning late
That's all I want
Now we need some space
'Cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone
It seems so short
I can't explain
Whatever happens in the future
Trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time
My life is going on
I will be so strong
Looking for a new version of myself
'Cause now all I want
Is to be a part of my new world

Whatever happens in the future
Trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Why not have it all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time
My life is going on
