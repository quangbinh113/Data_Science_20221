Song Name: Castle In The Snow
The light is fading now
My soul is running on a path that I can not reach
My brain is turning, and my head is hurting
Everyday a little bit more
The light is fading now
My force is being sucked by a bloody leech
My fear is smiling, and my dread is singing
Every night a little bit more
I can not see anything
I am blindfolded
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's a battle cry
I'm a zombie
I don't know what to do
I should be hidden in a place
But I gotta stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's a battle cry
I can hear the birds
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see the sky
It's a battle cry
I'm so lonely
I don't know if I'll get through
I wanna be floating in space
But I gotta stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's a battle cry
I can hear the birds
