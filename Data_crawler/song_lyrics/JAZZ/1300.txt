Song Name: Watch Me Burn
Don't lie to me
Oh baby, I've been thinking about it
You know that I've been dreaming about it
I'm gonna teach you some French
Headlight, hold tight (No, no, no, no)
Oh baby, you know I've been thinking about it
You know that I've been dreaming about it
You know the deal
Don't make any promises, promises
Got me flying high
Right where you want me to
Watch it, watch me burn
Right where you want me to
Dim the light, my lullaby
Touch me now, stop pretending
Fuck it, watch me burn
Say what you think
Oh baby, I could lose my mind
You know that I can lose my mind, yeah
What do you want me to be?
Headlight, hold tight (No, no, no, no)
Oh baby, you know I've been thinking about it
You know that I've been dreaming about it
You know the deal
Don't make any promises, promises
Got me flying high
Right where you want me to
Watch it, watch me burn
Right where you want me to
Dim the light, my lullaby
Touch me now, stop pretending
Fuck it, watch me burn
