Song Name: like i do
I see you pulling up to meet me in your car
I know you didn't have to drive, you don't live far from me
I know we're friends but baby, something's on my mind
So I apologize for taking all this time
But I got to tell you
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do (Yeah)
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do
No, so why should I pretend that the feeling isn't true?
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do
Love you like I do
I know at times you find it really hard to sleep (but I could)
But I could fix that if you're sleeping next to me (me baby)
You're so confused about the way I look at you
It's not intentional, I'm trying to find the right time to tell you, no
If the whole world breaks, seeing what's at stake
Would you be my girl? Would you be my world?
No, I can't break now, let me show you how
Loving me is what you need, it's a fact, it's simple
Loving me is what you need and it's so simple
Loving me is what you need and it's so
Loving me is what you need, girl, it's so simple
It's a fact, it's simple (Yeah)
Cause loving me is what you need, I can feel it when you go
Loving me is what you need
Don't you get it? Don't you know, baby?
So loving me is what you need and baby it's so simple
Trying to tell you, baby, but you just don't seem to see it, so I
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do (Yeah)
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do
No, so why should I pretend that the feeling isn't true?
No, I cannot pretend I don't love you like I do
Love you like I do
