Song Name: I Don't Mind
Let's go back again
I wanna be around you and I can't pretend
Lines I cross, all the rules I bend
I don't mind
So let's fall in deep
Baby that's a promise I know how to keep
You know I think about you and I just can't sleep
I don't mind
Sometimes I go too far to know if I can ever leave (ooh)
Sometimes I stay so far away, what's going on with me?
Let's go back again
I wanna be around you and I can't pretend
Lines I cross, all the rules I bend
I don't mind
So let's fall in deep
Baby that's a promise I know how to keep
You know I think about you and I just can't sleep
I don't mind
Sometimes I go too far to know if I can ever leave (ooh)
Sometimes I stay so far away, what's going on with me?
