Song Name: Night and Day
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you day and night
Night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's oh, such a hungry, yearning, burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
Night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
The silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's oh, such a hungry, yearning, burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night
Night and day, night and day
I love you, night and day
