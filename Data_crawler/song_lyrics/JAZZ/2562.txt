Song Name: You Can't Lose A Broken Heart - Single Version
Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart
If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start
Take a walk, think it over
While strolling 'neath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June
Weigh your remarks before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon
Don't be erratic, be diplomatic
To keep your hearts in tune
Cruel harsh words, often spoken
Will upset your applecart
So don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
'Cause you can't lose a broken heart
Look out, don't lose your head
Then lose your gal
You can't lose a broken heart, babe
If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start
Take a walk and think it over
While strolling 'neath the moon
Don't say things in December
Baby, you'll regret it too soon
Weigh your remarks before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon
Baby, don't be erratic, be diplomatic
To keep your hearts in tune, baby
Cruel harsh words, often spoken
Will upset your applecart, babe
So don't lose your head
Then lose your girl
'Cause you can't lose a broken heart
No, you can't, no, you can't
Lose a broken heart
