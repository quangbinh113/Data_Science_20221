Song Name: Let's Call The Whole Thing Off
Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that
Goodness knows what the end will be
Oh, I don't know where I'm at
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done
You say either, I say either
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either, neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off, yes
You like potato and I like potahto
You like tomato and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto
Let's call the whole thing off
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart
So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas
For we know, we need each other
So we better call the calling off, off
Oh, let's call the whole thing off, yes
You say laughter and I say larfter
You say after and I say arfter
Laughter, larfter, after, arfter
Let's call the whole thing off
You like vanilla and I like vanella
You saspiralla and I saspirella
Vanilla, vanella, chocolate, strawberry
Let's call the whole thing off
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart
So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters
For we know, we need each other
So we better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off
Yes, you say either and you say either
You say neither and you say neither
Either, either, neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off, oh, yes
You like potato and you like potahto
You like tomato and you like tomahto
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto
Let's call the whole thing off
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart
So if you like pyjamas (I like pyjahmas)
I'll wear pyjamas (you got pyjamas)
For we know, we need each other
So we better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off
Let's call the whole thing off (yes)
