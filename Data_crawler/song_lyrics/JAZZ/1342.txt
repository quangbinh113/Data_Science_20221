Song Name: Too Little
You got any like... oh
Come and sink on in it by the warm fire
Love you once you've paid it
Breathing under pressure for a pink sky
Wishing not for wet eyes
You got any like... oh
Come and sink on in it by the warm fire
Love you once you've paid it
Breathing under pressure for a pink sky
Wishing not for wet eyes
