Song Name: I'll Walk Alone
I'll walk alone
Because to tell you the truth
I'm being lonely
I don't mind being lonely
When my heart tells me you
I'm lonely too
I'll walk alone
They ask me why
And I'll tell I would rather
There are dreams
I must get them
Dreams they flash in the night
You hold tight
I'll always be near you
Wherever you are each night
And every prayer when you call out
I'll hear you
No matter how far
Just close your eyes
And I'll be there
Please walk alone
And send your love and your kisses
To guide me
Till you walk in beside me
I'll walk alone
You hold tight
I'll always be near you
Wherever you are each night
And every prayer when you call out
I'll hear you
No matter how far
Just close your eyes
And I'll be there
Please walk alone
And send your love and your kisses
To guide me
Till you walk in beside me
I'll walk alone.
