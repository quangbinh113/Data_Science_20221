Song Name: How Deep Is The Ocean - 1993 Digital Remaster
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How many times a day
Do I think of you?
How many roses
Are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
And if I ever lose you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
And if I ever lose you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
