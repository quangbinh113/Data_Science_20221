Song Name: Bonita - Special Edition
What can I say to you, Bonita?
What magic words would capture you?
Like a soft evasiveness you are, Bonita
You fly away when love is new
What do you ask of me, Bonita?
What part do you want me to play?
Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita?
I will be anything you say, ooh Bonita
Don't run away, Bonita
Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita
If you love me, life would be beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita
If you love me, life would be beautiful
Beautiful
Bonita
Bonita
Bonita
