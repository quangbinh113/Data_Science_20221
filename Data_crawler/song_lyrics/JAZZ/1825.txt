Song Name: Come Away With Me - Alternate Version
Come away with me in the night
Come away and I will write you a song
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us with their lies
And I want to walk with you on a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try?
To come away with me
And we'll kiss on a mountain top
Come away and I'll never stop loving you
I wanna wake up with the rain fallin' on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is
Come away with me in the night
Come away with me, oh, away
Come away with me in the night
