Song Name: If You Had My Love
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all
I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you
Play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly
Spend eternity
That's what you told me
That's what said
But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you realy want to Bae
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first there are some things
You need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love
Or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt
And I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
