Song Name: Flower
No one's awake, except for me
The silence is growing
Can I finally be me
See the oven glowing
Feel the dough folding
Morning's close, but far from plain sight
Will I see you on my way
Everything is closed, my heart is too
Fold the covers, back to bed
Goodnight moon
Birds begin to sing, "Bring the bread"
As they fly over my head
Picking the petals
Will I see you on my way
There must be a reason that I feel this way
I felt this before as you passed by the gate
There must be a reason
I saw you before and I felt this way
No one's awake, except for us
The girl with the flower
The boy with the flower
In his hair, In her hair
There must be a reason that I feel this way
I felt this before as you passed by the gate
There must be a reason
I saw you before and I felt this way
I felt this way
The boy with the flower (I felt this way)
The girl with the flower (I felt this way)
The boy with the flower (I felt this way)
