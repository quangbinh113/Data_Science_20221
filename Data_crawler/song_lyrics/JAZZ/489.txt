Song Name: Eenie Meenie
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla(if, if, if she holla)let her go
She's indecisive
She can't decide
She keeps on lookin'
From left to right
Girl, come a bit closer
Look in my eyes
Searching is so wrong
I'm Mr.Right
You seem like the type
To love em and leave em
And disappear right after the song
So give me tonight
To show you hold you
Don't leave me over here dancin' alone
You can't make up your mind mind mind mind mind
Please don't waste my time time time time time
I'm not tryna rewind wind wind wind wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
But shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova (oooh)
Let me show you what your missin'
Paradise
With me your winnin' girl
You don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for (here for)
Them other guys
I can see right through ya
You seem like the type
To love em and leave em
And disappear right after the song
So give me tonight
To show you and hold you
Don't leave me out here dancing alooone
Can't make up your mind mind mind mind mind
Please don't waste ma time time time time time
Not trying to rewind wind wind wind wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
