Song Name: It's a Beautiful Day
It's a beautiful day
Waking up in your arms
And I still feel sleepy.
I really really really
Don't wanna face the day
So many??? things to do that I can escape
But maybe there's something else
I'd like to stay here with you,
It'll be a beautiful day...
Sneaking out of the sheets
Snuggling up to you
Wanna wake you up slow??? to you
From our bed to Heaven's gate
And back again
So please treat me nice and gentle
Wrap my body around yours
It's a beautiful day
We'll be out of breath feeling drained
A lil' tingle in my feet
And shivers down my spine
I'm getting??? from the afterglow
Oh I'm feeling contented
I wanna do this again
It's a beautiful day
Getting up with the smile
Ready to face the day now
Feeling I've got all the world
Back and our lil' secret with me
But when I see you lying there looking at me
I think the day can wait till later
I wanna do this again
It's a beautiful day
