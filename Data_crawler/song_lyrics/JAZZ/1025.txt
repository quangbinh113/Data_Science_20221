Song Name: No Witness
Ah
I ain't got no problems with no niggas I don't know (I know personal problems)
And I don't know none of you niggas (I don't)
Ain't gotta keep in touch with no niggas I don't owe (Woah, let me see)
And I don't owe none of you niggas (Nobody)
Can't nobody tell on me if they don't know my business (Who the fuck know I did that?)
And they don't know my fucking business (Nobody)
I would've had an L if the feds had a witness (Who saw that shit?)
But ain't no motherfucking witness (Nobody)
Playing with me, boy, you know how close you is to dying
Talking 'bout how I'm winning, boy, you know how close I am to God (Amen)
If I went out my way just to prove I was certified
Then some bullshit happened to me, you know how that'd hurt the guys
Chopper cut the skin of your head, get 'em circumcised
I'm hopping in the Benz off the meds, I'm on a Perky flying
Free my mama, yeah, she saw more birds than a turkey drive
This shit was happening to you boys, I got it out the dirt with mine
Yeah, nigga, out the mud, clutching walking out the club
Nike slides, T-shirt on, still can pull out a dub
Spilled some food on my shirt, ain't worried with the stain on it
Still'll see you in the club take your bitch and rain on it
I ain't got no problems with no niggas I don't know (I don't know you niggas, man)
And I don't know none of you niggas
Ain't gotta keep in touch with no niggas I don't owe (Owe niggas nothing)
And I don't owe none of you niggas (Nah)
Can't nobody tell on me if they don't know my business (Nobody know shit)
And they don't know my fucking business (Nah)
I would've had an L if the feds had a witness (Acting like I'm 14)
But ain't no motherfucking witness (Bitch)
Niggas ask me why I ain't been calling, nigga, for what
Bro be looking like he down, but believe me, he up
Pull up on your mans, drop him then tease him, "Get up"
I don't like them niggas, they like, "What's the reason?" Ain't one
I just don't like niggas that ain't my niggas, that's how I'm feeling
Niggas greedy, niggas rats, niggas snakes, niggas bitch
I ain't even rushing to it, it just be coming to us, we different
It's a blessing that you rich, it's a blessing that we livin'
And then I say us a blessing 'cause I don't believe in love before I was up
I prayed for it, envisioned it, yeah, I seen me it
You can eat with us, but dawg, just don't think you sweet with us
'Cause I'm just like a pimple, I'll squeeze and bust
I ain't got no problems with no niggas I don't know
And I don't know none of you niggas
Ain't gotta keep in touch with no niggas I don't owe
And I don't owe none of you niggas
Can't nobody tell on me if they don't know my business
And they don't know my fucking business
I would've had an L if the feds had a witness
But ain't no motherfucking witness
