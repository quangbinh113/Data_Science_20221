Song Name: Adieu
Been a fool, been a clown
Lost my way from up and down
And i know, yes i know
And i see it in your eyes
That you really weren't suprised at me at all
Not at all
And i know by your smile it's you.
Don't care for me, don't cry
Let's say goodbye, adieu.
It's time to say goodbye, i know that in time
It will just fade away, it's time to say goodbye.
I stand alone, and watch you fade away like clouds
High up and in the sky
I'm strong and so cold
As i stand alone
Goodbye, so long, adieu.
Oh how i love you so, lost in those memories
And now you've gone
I feel the pain, feeling like a fool, adieu
My love for you burns deep
Inside me, so strong
Embers of times we had
And now here i stand lost in a memory
I see your face and smile.
Oh how i love you so, lost in those memories
And now you've gone
I feel the pain, feeling like a fool, adieu
My love for you burns deep
Inside me, so strong
Embers of times we had
And now here i stand lost in a memory
I see your face and smile
