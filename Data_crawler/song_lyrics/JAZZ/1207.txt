Song Name: Silver Haze - Jack Laboz Remix
Mama said "Stay to my dear
We on the verge of a darker year"
My heart is tired of this place
New York, New York, I think it's time
I've lost touch with your state of mind
My heart is tired of this place
Gotta get out of here, gotta get out of this race
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here, I can't make it this way
Gotta get out of here
Silver haze, take my mind
Silver haze, just you and I
Silver haze, take me tonight
Silver haze, just you and I
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
4 am, cleanin' up the bar
Makin' a dollar just to play guitar
My feet are tired of this place
Throwin' down lines in the studio
Keep you dancin' while you're at my show
My voice is tired of this place
Gotta get out of here, gotta get out of this race
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here, I can't make it this way
Gotta get out of here
Silver haze, take my mind
Silver haze, just you and I
Silver haze, take me tonight
Silver haze, just you and I
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Silver haze, take my mind
Silver haze, just you and I
Silver haze, take me tonight
Silver haze, just you and I
Silver haze, take my mind
Silver haze, just you and I
Silver haze, take me tonight
Silver haze, just you and I
