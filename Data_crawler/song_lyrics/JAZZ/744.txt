Song Name: Marvin & Miles
Tall guy in the corner
Tenor sax at hand
I guess i had to warn her
She wouldn't understand
She's freaking out on music
A variety of styles
And now she's stuck in the middle
With the moods of marvin & miles
You know you've got me so excited
The tenor softly said
I don't know how to hide it
Let's have a ball instead
She slipped into his nightmare
For longer than a while
And now she's stuck in the middle
With the moods of marvin & miles
She really doesn't know it's plain to see
He's not working on her family tree
You see it's all part of the show
It's only tenor men's job to blow
So now the blue notes flow
And she's free to go
And rise to the occasion of an all time low
I guess she knows how it feels to be blown
Away in be bop style
Ooh i know...
It's like you're stuck in the middle
