Song Name: Long Live the (D)Evil
Time to go now
On the last way
We're invisible below these clothes
Made of night
It's time to ride I follow
That devilish night
To a place where we all know
We won't ever need a fight
And when the devil sets me free
Long live the devil
And if the good becomes the bad
Long live the evil
This toy was set on fire
By a man with no name
A man who was never ever granted
Neither peace nor fame
Well if the devil sets him free
Long live the devil
And if the good becomes the bad
Long live the evil
But how evil is a man
Oh how evil is a man
Who can set us eternal
I say how evil is a man
Tell me how evil can he be
And if the planes are higher
Will he die in vain
He'll burn it in labour
And birth still remains
Oh devil set me free
And long life the devil
And if the good becomes the bad
Long live the evil
But how evil is a man
Oh how evil is a man
I said how evil is a man
Who can set us eternal
I say how evil is a man
Tell me how evil can he be
