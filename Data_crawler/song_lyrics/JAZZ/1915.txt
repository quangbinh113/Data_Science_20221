Song Name: The Shadow of Your Smile (Love Theme from "The Sandpiper")
One day we walked along the sand, one day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand to mend its broken wing
Now I'll remember many a day and many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song, the shadow of her smile
The shadow of your smile, when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I
Now when I remember spring, all the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering the shadow of your smile
