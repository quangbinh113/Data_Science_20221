Song Name: Someone To Watch Over Me - Demo
There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad
I've had in mind
Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
But he's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome to my heart
He carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch
Over me
Now he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
But to my heart he carries the key
Ooh, ooh, ooah
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over it
