Song Name: Slow Down
I'm on my second guess
Or maybe my second best
What do I have to do?
To know that I'm getting through
I don't have much to say
Just hoping you'd come my way
What do I have to do?
To come and get close to you
Come get close to you
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' round again
I'm ready to go again
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say no
Just one look and I think it starts to show
I think that I already know
Coloring in the greys
I see your every shade
I'm runnin' back around
To tell you I hold you down
I could say everything
Pullin' me by the string
What do I have to do?
Tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' round again
I'm ready to go again
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say no
Just one look and I think it starts to show
I think that I already know
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' round again
I'm ready to go again (Ready to go)
Baby I won't slow down and I won't say no
Just one look and I think it starts to show
I think that I already know
