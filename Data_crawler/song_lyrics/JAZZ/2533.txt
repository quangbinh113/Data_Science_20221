Song Name: I'll Close My Eyes
Heaven sends a song through its doors
Just as if it seems to know, I'm exclusively yours
Knowing this, I feel but one way
You will understand too, in these words that I say
I'll close my eyes to everyone but you
And when I do, I'll see you standing there
I'll lock my heart to any other caress
I'll never say yes to a new love affair
I'll close my eyes to everything that's gay
If you're not there, to share each lovely day
And through the years, those moments
When we're far apart
I'll close my eyes and see you with my heart
I'll close my eyes to everything that's gay
Lord, if you are not there, to share each lovely day
And through the years those moments
When we're far apart
I'll close my eyes oh and see you with my heart
