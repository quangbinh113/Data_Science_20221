Song Name: You'll Never Find Another Love like Mine (with Laura Pausini) - Live
Good evening, everybody
You'll never find, as long as you live
Someone who loves you tender like I do
You'll never find, no matter where you search
Someone who cares about you the way I do
I know I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else, no one else. No one else
And you'll never find, it'll take the end of all time
Someone who understands you like I do
I know I'm not tryin' to make you stay
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else, no, no one else. No one else
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my love), yes you are
And you'll never find another love like mine
Someone who needs you like I do (are you sure, baby)
I know I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else, and there is no one else, no
There's just no one else (no one else)
You're gonna miss my love
I'm gonna miss your love
You're gonna miss my love
You're gonna miss my love
Laura Pausini
Thank you, very kind, arrivederci
