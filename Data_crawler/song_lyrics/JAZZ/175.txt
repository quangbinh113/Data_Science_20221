Song Name: Skechers
I tried to stop, but I can't stop
I just can't stop thinking about her
I don't know
All I remember was she wear the Skechers
The light-up ones
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light up, light up, Skechers
Light up, light up, my world
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light up, light up, Skechers
Light up, light up, my world
I like your Skechers, you like me my Gucci shoes
I'll buy you the purse, only if you show me your boobs
I like your Skechers, you like me too
Bring your friends, all of us in the pool
Bad lil' bitch, all my drip make her drool
Brand new whip, come and sit in the coupe
Hmm, I just wanna make you mine
Hop inside the ride
Nina by my side, promise you it'll all be fine
I-I just wanna make you mine
Hop inside the ride
Nina by my side, promise it's gon' be all right
Shawty bad with a Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light up, light up, Skechers
Light up, light up, my world
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand make you my girl
Light up, light up, Skechers
Light up, light up, my world
