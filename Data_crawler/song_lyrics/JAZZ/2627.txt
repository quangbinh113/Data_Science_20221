Song Name: Since I Fell for You
You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now youre gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess Ill never be the same
Since I fell for you
Its too bad, its so sad, Im in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do, Im still in love with you
I guess Ill never see the light
I get the blues bout every night
Since I fell for you, since I fell for you
