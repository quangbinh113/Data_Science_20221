Song Name: This Bitter Earth
This bitter earth
Well, what a fruit it bears
What good is love
Mm, mm, that no one shares?
And if my life is like the dust
Ooh, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows
Lord, this bitter earth
Yes, can be so cold
Today, you're young
Too soon, you're old
But while a voice within me cries
I'm sure someone may answer my call
And this bitter earth
Ooh, may not, oh, be so bitter after all
