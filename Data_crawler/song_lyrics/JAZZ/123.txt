Song Name: right here
I think some words are overdue
Could we just do it over?
Can we just talk it out like friends
Because I need your shoulder?
I know we ended on the wrong terms
But I said we're past it
So why you texting me with questions
You don't gotta ask me, like
"I know it's random, how you've been?"
"Do you remember 'bout this band you said you listened to?"
"When we were younger"
"When we were softer"
"When we were all about each other"
"Hope life is treating you better"
Better, better
Girl, what's with that?
Yo, cut the act
'Cause I don't got time for laughs
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me
Because I'm here

If you need me I'll be here
Right here
Said I'm here
If you need me I'll be here
Right here
And how you liking this new guy?
I know you always want the new life
I hope you taking care of you, like
The way you cared for me in my time
See you got yourself some new friends
No, you don't need to go to Houston
You got me thinking back about then
Girl, I wonder why you texting (Girl, what's with that?)
Yo, cut the act
'Cause I don't got time for laughs
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me
Because I'm here

If you need me I'll be here
Right here
Said I'm here
If you need me I'll be here
Right here
