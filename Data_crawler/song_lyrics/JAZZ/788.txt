Song Name: Scarred Hearts at War
Distance between us
We're two worlds apart
You are in hiding
While my heart's been marked
From your love
With your words
The promises you broke
I don't believe in miracles anymore
You were the wish I couldn't hold
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
You left me here alone to bleed
I feel us fading
Our scarred hearts at war
Tears they are flowing
Now we're at ocean floor
Because of your love
And your choices
The hurt that you've caused
I don't believe in miracles anymore
You were the wish I couldn't hold
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
I've been thinking why you did that
Why you wanna break like a Kit Kat
Late night calls don't you miss that
Too much pride can't admit that
And that something I know
If you don't want me then go
Just go on like a show
I'm cool, my heart on snow
Yeah, I'm just glad I didn't buy you no ring
Matter of fact I need back everything
Got me out here just stressing
Guess this was a blessing
'Cause you were something I didn't need
Now you gone I need something to fill it
Pour me up I need something to heal it
Don't try to need me
You know where to see me
Gon' be at the top like a ceiling
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
Is love a losing game?
How will I ever be the same?
Is hurt my company?
You left me here alone to bleed
Scarred hearts at war
How will I ever be the same?
Scarred heart at war
You left me here alone to bleed
