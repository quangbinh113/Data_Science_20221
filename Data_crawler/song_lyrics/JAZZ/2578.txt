Song Name: Night and Day - Take 1
Night and day you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you
Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Under the hide of me
There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
'Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night
Under the hide of me
There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
'Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night
