Song Name: I'm Shy
You say it's below me but no
I cannot control it
I still love you
I do, I do do, ahh
I don't want forever
Just want that smell on your sweater
When I hold you
I do I do I do
Tell me what you wanna say honey
I know I'm giving more than what you wanna take from me
I been on the grind, but tonight let me let loose
Oh you got my head under pillows
Like a loose tooth
Do you wanna dance?
Get real close?
I can pop an MJ
Have me on my toes
I wrote this letter
Now or never
I'm shy
Aye yi yi yi
Middle of the dance floor
Look so fly
Let's talk, baby
Do you wanna dance?
Maybe
I'm shy
Ay yi yi yi
I can't wait another full night so let's
Please talk
Baby
What you wanna say, babe?
Tell me
Yeah
Come on, come on
Yeah, feels like I caught a red shell
Super stars round my head, well
If she blowin up your phone she can catch a fade
I got your heart locked up with a key blade
I can't help it you look too good
Phew
Come and a catch a vibe with your YFU
Oh my god, I like you
Oh my god, I I I
Phew!
So baby call
212-956
Extension with 3 555s
And I'll do it for you
Baby please on my knees
Am I coming through?
Ain't nobody gonna do it like the way I do
Know you need me, nekomimi
Keep it milky ooh
So let me get to know you more, Can I?
Do it right there with your spirit sword, Senpai!
I'm shy
Aye yi yi yi
Middle of the dance floor
Look so fly
Let's talk, baby
Do you wanna dance?
Maybe
I'm shy
Ay yi yi yi
I can't wait another full night so let's
Please talk
Baby
What you wanna say, babe?
Tell me

Ooh, ooh
Tell me what you wanna say, aye
Ooh, ooh
Cmon, woo!
