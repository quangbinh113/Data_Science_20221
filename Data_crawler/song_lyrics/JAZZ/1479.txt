Song Name: I Think I Love You Again
There are times that I
Think that I've had enough
And I feel that I
Think that maybe I'm done
No matter how hard I try
I just can't walk away
So I think that I
Think that I'm here to stay
I think I love you again
I think I love you again
I think I love you again
I think I love you again
(Oh)
You see when it comes to love
I'm not the best that there is (I'm not the best that there is)
And when the times get rough
Loving doesn't come easily
But my skin is tough
And I know that you're the one that I want
So I won't give up on us
I promise you I'm down for the run (I think I love you again)
(I think I that I love)
I think I love you again
(I think I that I love)
I think I love you again
I think I love you again
Girl, you stole (girl, you stole my heart)
You stole my heart
Every single (every single)
Every single part (every single part)
And girl you are (girl, you are)
Girl, you are the one (you are the one)
And now I think (then I think)
I think I love (I think I love you again)
I think I love you again
(I think I that I love)
I think I love you again
I think I love you again
(I love)
