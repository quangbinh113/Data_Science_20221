Song Name: Loving You
Loving you is not a choice
It's who I am
Loving you is not a choice
Not much reason to rejoice
But it gives me purpose
Gives me voice
To say to the world
This is why I live
You are why I live
Loving you is why I do the things I do
Loving you is not in my control
But loving you, I have a goal
For what's left on my life
I will live
And I would die
For you
Loving you is why I do the things I do
Loving you is not in my control
But loving you, I have a goal
For what's left on my life
I will live
And I would die
I will live
And I would die
For you
