Song Name: Stripes + Squares - Penguin Prison Remix
Are we stripes? Are you square?
Do you see me falling everywhere?
See those strings in the sky?
Do we always gotta waste our time?
Da-da-da, da-da-die, you got a funny way
Never know what you're tryna say, la-la-la-la
Should I fall away or stay here and crack another joke
Just blowing smoke
All the girls lookin' for the picture-perfect guy
I just wanna feel alive
All the boys lookin' for a quiet little trophy wife
I wanna
Kick it back down the river with you
And if we float away, I think it's cool
You know I'm down just to lose it with you
Are we stripes? Are we square?
Do we really even need to care?
Are we stripes? Are we square?
Do we really even need to care?
All the girls lookin' for the picture-perfect guy
I just wanna feel alive
All the boys lookin' for a quiet little trophy wife
I wanna
Kick it back down the river with you
And if we float away, I think it's cool
You know I'm down just to lose it with you
Are we stripes? Are we square?
Do we really even need to care?
(Are we stripes? Are we square?)
Are we stripes? Are we square?
Do we really even need to care?
