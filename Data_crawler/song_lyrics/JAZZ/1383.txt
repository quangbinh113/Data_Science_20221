Song Name: Moonlight In Vermont
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves of sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Moonlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
As they travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely.
Evening summer breeze
Warblings of the meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
You and me and moonlight in Vermont
