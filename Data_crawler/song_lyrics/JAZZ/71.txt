Song Name: May I Ask
May I ask you how you've been
Would I have the words to say
I've forgotten how to feel
How to call you by your name
Barely recognize you now
All your words have turned to stone
You've forgotten all my songs
You've forgotten all my love
Don't you know
You make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind
Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love
And by now your smile has changed
You don't look at me the same
It's naive of me to think
That one day you'll miss my name
Promises you said you'd keep
Empty lines between the scenes
Was it wrong for me to trust
I'm still only seventeen
Don't you know
You make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind
Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love
It's just my natural reaction to you
Making me feel like I've lost sanity
And I can't help but to miss you though I know there's never a chance
Don't you know
You make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind
Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love
Don't you know
You make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind
Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love
