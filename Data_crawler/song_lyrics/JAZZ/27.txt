Song Name: by my side
You were there every time
Every time that I needed a shoulder
And you kept me warm
When my world grew darker and colder
You gave your strength
When mine had gone
And I could not go on
Where were you when
I hurt the most?
Where were you when
I needed hope?
I needed you close
You were by my side
Where were you?
Where were you?
You were by my side
Where were you?
Where were you?
You were by my side
You pick me up
Anytime that I start sinking lower
And I think to myself
What would life be if I didn't know ya?
You were the spark
That lit the path to carry on
Where were you when
I hurt the most?
Where were you when
I needed hope?
I needed you close
You were by my side
Where were you?
Where were you?
You were by my side
Where were you?
Where were you?
You were by my side
You were by my side
So sweet
Sweet as love you gave to me
And I swear, I swear oh
That I will love you 'till the end
You were by my side
You were by my side (you were by my side, you were by my side)
You were by my side
