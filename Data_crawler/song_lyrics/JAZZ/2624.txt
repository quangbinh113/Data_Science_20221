Song Name: See-Line Woman
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright now
Du-du-du
Alright
See-line woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And then go home
See-line woman
See-line woman
Dressed in green
Wears silk stockings
With golden seams
See-line woman
See-line woman
Dressed in red
Make a man
Lose his head
See-line woman
See-line woman
Black dress on
For a thousand dollars
She wail and she moan
See-line woman
Wiggle wiggle
Purr like a cat
Wink at a man
And he wink back
Now, child
See-line woman
Empty his pockets
And wreck his days
Make him love her
And she'll fly away
Woman, yeah
See-line woman
Take it on out now
Empty his pockets
And she wreck his days
And she make him love her
Then she sure fly away
She got a black dress on
For a thousand dollars
She wail and she moan
