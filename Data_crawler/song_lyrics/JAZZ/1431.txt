Song Name: Georgia On My Mind
Georgia, Georgia the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Yeah man
Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you
Yes
Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
