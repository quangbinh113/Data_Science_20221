Song Name: Just The Same
Smash all the pictures
Where I am in the frame
Toy with my emotions
As if it is a game
In the heat of the moment
Call someone else's name
I would love you just the same
Drag me through the dirt
Cut me to the bone
Leave me for dead
Laugh your way back home
I'd still be smiling like a madman in the rain
I would love you just the same
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I'd still love you just the same
Flood me with malice
'Til the river's running red
Make me an outlaw
Put a price upon my head
And cast me to exile or a house for the insane
And I will love you just the same
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I still love you just the same
'Cause I still love you just the same
