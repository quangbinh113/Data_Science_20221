Song Name: What a Wonderful World
I see trees of green, red roses too
I watch them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
Bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
They're really saying, "I love you"
I see babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
