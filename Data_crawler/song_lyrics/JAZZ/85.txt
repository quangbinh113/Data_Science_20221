Song Name: If I Could Ride a Bike
If I could ride a bike
I'd zoom around the world
With you sitting there behind me
I'll take you to places
Pass several faces
Just livin' life so carefree
If I could sail a boat
I'd cruise across the seas
A sweet adventure for us two
I'll be Jack, and you, Rose
Just please don't let me go
'Cause I'd be nothing without you
Oh, when you call me
I'm drifting on clouds
Like I'm dreaming
But in the morning
I'll wake up and see that you're stuck
Here with me
Oh, when you call me
I'm drifting on clouds
Like I'm dreaming
But in the morning
I'll wake up and see that you're stuck
Here with me
If only you knew
What I would do for you
I'd jump up and hold you
So tightly
But I will never be
Able to do these things
So I'm just left imagining
