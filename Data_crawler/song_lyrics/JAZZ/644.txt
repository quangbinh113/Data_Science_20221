Song Name: Moon river
Moon river
Wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh dream maker
You heart breaker
Wherever you're going
I'm going your way
Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
It's moon river and me
