Song Name: Que Sera
A record of the delightful piece
They're going to play this evening
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
La-la-la-la-la-ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
Your-your-your attention please!
And the moment we've been waiting for is here
I, I have something to tell you
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
The future's not ours, future's not ours, future's not ours...
I believe in the future
I believe in the future
I don't believe in miracles
Ca-ca-can it be true
It must be true! No doubt!
Life is going on as normally as ever
But suddenly something seems to have happened
(Suddenly something seems to have happened)
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction
People seem to be frightened, even te-te-terrified
[Sample: To Be or Not to Be (dir. Ernst Lubitsch, 1942)]
I want everybody to understand this
I-I don't understand
I don't understand
There are a lot of things we don't understand
I don't understand either
We need answers from you
What did you expect to find
What did you expect to find
What's going to be our future
It's your responsibility to do something about it
Well I, I have the key
All I have to find is the lock, the lock, the lock...
Now listen to me, all of you
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
Dam sim sam da la da la la la
Oh you're divine
