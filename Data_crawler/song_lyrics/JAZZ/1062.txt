Song Name: Donâ€™t Go (with Justin Bieber & Don Toliver)
Don't go, don't
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't
Don't go
My Mona Lisa, baby
My masterpiece, bae (my masterpiece)
When I'm pieces, baby
You give me peace of mind
You tell me we'll be fine
You always get me right
When it's dark you're my light
Baby, that's why I need you on the regular
And if it wasn't you, you know it would never work (work, work, work)
Got me goin' out my way to show what you're worth
Don't go (don't go)
I put in the work to hear you say (don't go, don't)
Misery missin' your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (don't go, don't)
Ooh, this is where you supposed to be (don't go)
I woke up in the city, I ain't seen your face
Almost lost my mind, medication (woah)
Five stars for participation (yeah)
It's a COVID operation (woo)
Hope you hear this where your stationed (stationed)
I lost my Bonnie, by that time you already banged it (Banged it)
She armed and dangerous, that long hair got me tangled up (Yeah)
You are my Topanga, stood your ground, even when they aimed at us (yeah, yeah)
Even through all of that pain, none of it was in vain (none of it was in vain, yeah)
And I'm proud of who you become, hope you feel the same (the same, yeah)
Frozen, don't let me go (don't go, don't), but let it go, please
We've been so close, don't go ghostin' me (don't go, don't go)
My vital OG, that's on the record, you make me better (don't go)
I put in the work to hear you say (don't go, don't)
Misery missin' your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (don't go, don't)
Ooh, this is where you supposed to be (don't go)
Peace and love (peace and love, don't go, don't)
You talk about him like he's decent enough (decent enough, don't go, don't go)
I see you moving, is he keeping up? (keeping up, don't go, don't-)
Don't know what you're doing but you needing love (needing love, don't go, don't)
Needing love (needing love, don't go, don't)
How far can you get, girl?
You know I've been in love with you since the beginning, girl (don't go, don't go)
Talking out of tone to me, gotta be kidding, girl (don't go, don't)
Get you all alone with me, gotta be committed, yeah
Girl, I need to see your face, hit the gas to win the race
Thirty pounds of loaded bass, move it, babe, I love the chase
Do your dirt, I keep the taste, pop that shit and make me wait
Shorty like that (shorty like that), call me up but I might be late
I put in the work to hear you say (don't go, don't)
Misery missin' your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (don't go, don't)
Ooh, this is where you supposed to be (don't go)
Don't go, don't
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't
Don't go
