Song Name: Tell It To My Heart
I can't work you out
Are you thinking 'bout something better?
Holding on to you
While you drag me through stormy weather
The only time you smile is in the photographs
And when I pull you close, it's like you're holding back
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing if it's me you're missing?
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dying
Tell it to my heart, heart, oh-ah

Tell it to my heart, heart, oh-ah
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing if it's me you're missing?
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dying
Tell it to my heart
Before a light goes out
Come and tell me now if something's fading

'Cause I can feel it in every single thing that you're not saying
And you move close to me, but I can feel the space
Whatever time we have, I'm not gonna waste
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing if it's me you're missing?
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence
Tell it to my heart, heart, oh-ah
Tell it to my heart, heart, oh-ah

Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing if it's me you're missing?
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dying
Tell it to my heart
