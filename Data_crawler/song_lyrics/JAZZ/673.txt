Song Name: Weapon of Voice
So what was it about the market in town
You really thought that you could bucket in a tuxedo
But then they put you in a bracket and now
You are convinced that you could somehow, somehow make it though
You're really concentrated selling, selling celery salt
You're measuring, measuring minute by minute the cost
The risk that we are meaning for you
But you're missing the point, missing the point
I heard sometimes they call you Patrick
Because you panic when your name's not on the radio
And that regardless of the season
You're drinking champagne without any reason
Come and lift me in the air, lift me forth and back
I'm a little leaf, I'm swinging, but I will not crack
Come and jump into the mud, let me see you slide
I'm a little leaf, I'm falling, but I will not hide
Come and take me in your palm, I don't weigh a pound
But I keep on ringing, ringing when I come around
And I keep on singing, and I keep on singing, singing
And I keep on singing, singing singing
And I keep on singing singing, singing singing
So what was it about the market in town
You really thought that you could bucket in a tuxedo
But then they put you in a bracket and now
You're still convinced that you can somehow, somehow make it though
The su-su-sugar atop your cake is exploding
You sh-sh-should have reloaded your guns
The sons of your nuns are claiming explanation of choice
So here's the weapon of voice
Come and lift me in the air, lift me forth and back
I'm a little leaf, I'm swinging, but I will not crack
Come and jump into the mud, let me see you slide
I'm a little leaf, I'm falling, but I will not hide
Come and take me in your palm, I don't weigh a pound
But I keep on ringing, ringing when I come around
And I keep on singing, and I keep on singing singing, singing
And I keep on singing, singing
And I keep on singing, singing singing
Singing singing
And I keep on singing, and I keep on singing singing
And I keep on singing, singing singing
Singing singing
