Song Name: That's Amore - Remastered
In Napoli, where love is king
When boy meets girl, here's what they say
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine like
You've had too much wine, that's amore

Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay, like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
When you dance down the street with
A cloud at your feet, you're in love

When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see, back in old Napoli, that's amore
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore
(That's amore)
When the world seems to shine like
You've had too much wine, that's amore
(That's amore)
Bells will ring (Ting-a-ling-a-ling), ting-a-ling-a-ling
(And you'll sing "Vita bella") Vita bella, vita bella
Hearts will play (Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay)
Like a gay tarantella
Lucky Fella
When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
(That's amore)
When you dance down the street with
A cloud at your feet, you're in love

When you walk in a dream, but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see, back in old Napoli, that's amore (Amore)
That's amore
