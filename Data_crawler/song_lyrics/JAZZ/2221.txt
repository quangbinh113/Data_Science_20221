Song Name: The touch of your lips
The touch of your lips
Upon my brow
Your lips that are cool
And sweet
Such tenderness
Lies in their soft caress
My heart forgets to beat
The touch of your hands
Upon my head
The love in your eyes ashine
And now, at last
The moment divine
The touch of your lips
The love in your eyes
The touch of your lips
On mine
