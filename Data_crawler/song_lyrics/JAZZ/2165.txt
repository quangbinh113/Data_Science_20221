Song Name: Whatever Lola Wants - Gotan Project Remix
What ever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have(your mind to have)
No regrets(no regrets)
Reline yourself resign yourself you're through
I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul is what I came for
What ever Lola wants(Lola wants)
Lola gets(Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win(can't win you'll never never win)
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible you fool
Give in (give in you'll never win)
I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul is what I came for
What ever Lola wants(Lola wants)
Lola gets(Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win(can't win you'll never never win)
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible you fool
Give in (give in you'll never win)
