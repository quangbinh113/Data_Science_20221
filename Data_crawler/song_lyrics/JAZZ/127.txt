Song Name: atlas
I can't take it
Tired I'm falling to my knees
I'm weighted
Carry me home like you used to
When I burn my organs, pour the bourbon
Bear my burdens for the moment
Can I get some help that's a hell no
But I bet she'd break her neck for that cell phone
Atlas shrugged his shoulders
Said he'd drop that boulder
Call me in the morning when I'm sober
Find me in the corner in a coma
Bottoms up
Never stop, I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not yeah I think I'm falling off, falling off
I don't belong here, lemme start over
I wanna sleep so wake me up when I'm older
Do not disturb, lost when I'm dreaming
Kick to that curb all my angels and demons
Guess I'm a little bit scared
Of the things I don't understand
Finding semblance of comfort
That nothing will go like I planned
Atlas shrugged his shoulders
Said he'd drop that boulder
Call me in the morning when I'm sober
Find me in the corner in a coma
Bottoms up
Never stop, I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not yeah I think I'm falling off, falling off
Bottoms up
Never stop, I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not yeah I think I'm falling off, falling off
