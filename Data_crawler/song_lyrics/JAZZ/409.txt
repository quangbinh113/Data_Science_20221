Song Name: Bored
Ah-ah-ah


Ah-ah-ah
The games you played were never fun, mm
You'd say you'd stay, but then you'd run (ah-ah-ah)
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore, what makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored
I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you're God knows where, mm
I hope you don't think that shit's fair (ah-ah-ah)
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore, what makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored
I'm so bored, so bored
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore, what makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
