Song Name: Castles in the Air
I try to make you happy
And hope you'll never stray
I try and every time it's all in vain
And when you say you love me
It's only for today
And as the glow of new love fades
This simple spell is bound to break
Love's not always here to stay
Fickle as the wind that changes daily
The world keeps breaking its promises
All the foolish games we play
Castles in the air and paper daydreams
But you keep breaking your promises
And when the day is over
I'll know the end is near
When every star above has disappeared
I will remember clearly
How I was once in your embrace
And as the moonlight fades away
I'll find you weren't here to stay
Love's not alway here to stay
Fickle as the wind that changes daily
The world keeps breaking its promises
All the foolish games we play
Guaranteed to leave me lost and crazy
But you keep breaking your promises
All the foolish games we play
Castles in the air and paper daydreams
But you keep breaking your promises
Your promises to me
Your promises to me
Your promises to me
Your promises to me
