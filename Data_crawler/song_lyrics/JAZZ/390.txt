Song Name: You
All my friends talk about the night we met
Can't remember what I said?
But bet it wasn't cool (bet it wasn't cool)
I was close to death with you in that perfect dress
Knowing that it's heart or head
Breaking all the rules (breaking all the rules)
Just like, don't fall in love, before I know your name
Holding out hoping that you feel the same
No, I've never been one for sounding clich√©
But it's true
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how your leap of faith made me put all my faith in you
So all I do is think about
No regrets, not even the nights we spent
Finding out what patience meant?
Holding up a mirror to myself
Learning to reflect
Because, love like this doesn't come around all the time
Letting you get away would be a crime
'Cause half of your heart makes a hole out of this heart of mine
Ooh, all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how your leap of faith made me put all my faith in you
So all I do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how long I can't wait until I get to say, "I do"
So all I do is think about
How all my friends talk about the night we met
Can't remember what I said?
But it worked out, beautiful
All do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All do is think about how your leap of faith made me put all my faith in you (all I do is think about you)
So all I do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how long I can't wait until I get to say, "I do"
So all I do is think about you (all I do is think about you)
