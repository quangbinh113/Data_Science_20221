Song Name: Embraceable You - 1940 Single Version
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty papa,
Come to baby, come to babydo
My sweet embraceable you
Instrumental
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty papa
Come to baby, come to baby do
My sweet embraceable you
