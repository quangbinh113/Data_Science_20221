Song Name: Stronger Than
Is it my fault I can't speak
Or that my body becomes weak
Or that I can hardly move
At the very thought of you
Nothin' ever really got to me
I could always turn the other cheek
Could it be those days are gone?
I could've sworn that I was strong
Or at least stronger than these emotions
That are takin' over me
I swear I'm stronger than these emotions
But they're takin' over me
No no no, this can't be it
The less you are the less she is
No no no, I can usually handle this
Wasn't ready for these
Wasn't ready for these emotions
That are takin' over me
I swear I'm stronger than these emotions
But they're takin' over me
You're the silence in a roaring crowd
You're the equivalent of a fluffy cloud
A genie in a bottle
I'll make a wish to wish the wishes will never end, and it'll never end
You're the platinum in my treasure chest
You're the answer I never woulda guessed in my love life test
And I don't mind at all, I don't mind at all
I swear that I'm stronger than these emotions
But they're takin' over me
I swear that I'm stronger than these emotions
But they're takin' over me
