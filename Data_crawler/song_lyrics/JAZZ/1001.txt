Song Name: The River with No Name
Maybe this time we will get it right
Every step's just a step until the one where you stop
They say the third time's a charm
Yeah, well, how about the ninth?
Or maybe I look at this a different way
You only know where you've been
Not where you're going to be
If you learn as you go, you gotta go just to learn
So take a step into the river with no name
And you'll be carried off into a horizon that you've never known
Don't close your eyes, it'll all be okay
Come dry yourself beside the fire
Made of all those former worries that you've carried inside you
There's no need for names
Just let them burn and warm yourself by the flames
We thought this time would be a different case
That we know where we are and we know what we want
It only lasted two years
But hey, that's better than one
So back to throwing ideas at the wall
My throwing arm's getting good
Yeah, I could do it all day
And you know I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun
Let's take a step into the river with no name
And we'll be carried off into a horizon that we've never known
Don't close your eyes, it'll all be okay
Come dry yourself beside the fire
Made of all those former worries that you've carried inside you
There's no need for names
Just let them burn, we'll warm ourselves with the flames
