Song Name: Lovesong (The Way) [feat. Bluets]
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh
Why is your voice so sonically pleasing to me?
I can't figure it out
Slight undertones of sadness while you tell me you're gonna leave
I cannot bear to see you smiling in that picture with your friends
I could go on about your smile, it's so grand
But you take your time, my love
Don't ever tell me that it just takes time to love
As long as I'm writing this song about your loveliness
Is it too much to ask
For a reply?
Or a text?
Or a way to tell you love me like before
Now you're away with nothing to say
My heart aches like never before
Filled with desire, you've inspired me to write another verse
I think we're alone now
You can tell me it was all just a game
Yes, we're alone now
But the feeling's slightly changed
But you take your time, my love
Don't ever tell me that it just takes time to love
As long as I'm writing this song about my love for you
Is it too much to ask
For a reply?
Or a text?
Or a way to tell you love me like before
In your eyes I see something I don't want to hear
In your eyes I see poems and
Novels, short stories I don't want to hear
But you tell me anyway, anyway
But you take your time, my love
Don't ever tell me that it just takes time to love
As long as I'm writing this song about your loveliness
Is it too much to ask
For a reply?
Or a text?
Or a way to tell you love me like before
Or a way to tell you love me like before
Or a way to tell you love me...
