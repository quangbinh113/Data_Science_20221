Song Name: Come Meh Way
Land throw free throw
I can't jump high, but I hear all the notes
I can't beat you no
I can't beat you, but I can be true tho
I want to be friends
I wan't to be friends 'til time ends yes
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
And I can't escape, I get blown away
When you come meh way (when you come meh way)
