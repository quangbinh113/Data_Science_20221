Song Name: It Had to Be You (Big Band and Vocals)
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
Or even be glad, just to be sad
Thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Try to be boss
They wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
Baby, it had to be you, wonderful you
Had to be you
