Song Name: Warriors
As a child, you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'll be
The one that work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things you that would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town, from dust
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town, from dust
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town, from dust
