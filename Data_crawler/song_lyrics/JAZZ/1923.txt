Song Name: Staying Alive
Now, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women's warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The new york times effect on man
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get enough, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin man and I just can't lose
Now it's all right, it's ok
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The new york times effect on man
Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Sayin' life goin nowhere, somebody help me
Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
