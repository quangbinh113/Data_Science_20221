Song Name: One In A Million
I've been thinkin' 'bout you again
Secret just for me and my friends
I didn't wanna tell you
'Cause I knew that shit would go to your head, yeah
But now I've got this drink in my hands
I take another sip and say
You're one in a million
You give me that feelin', I want it all day
I know that we're different, but it makes no difference
I think you should stay
Why don't we dance?
Fuck, you look good when I'm faded
I'll give you a chance, let you be my new favorite now
Get everybody talkin' 'bout us
No more playin' tough, now I've drank enough
So why don't we dance, so I can finally say how I feel?
I take another sip and say
You're one in a million
You give me that feelin', I want it all day, yeah
I know that we're different, but it makes no difference
I think you should stay, yeah
Everything about us is nice
Everything about it is right
We're sweet like sugar and spice, baby
Everything about us is nice
Everything about it is right, baby
Sweet like sugar and spice, baby (ooh!)
You're (you're) one in a million
Girl, you're one in a million (one in a million)
You give me that feelin' (you give me that feelin')
I want it all day (well, I want it all day now)
I know that we're different (girl, I know that we're different, baby)
But it makes no difference
I think you should stay (oh, baby, baby, baby)
You're one in a million
You give me that feelin', I want it all day
