Song Name: Prisoner of Love
Alone from night to night you find me
Too weak to break these chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
For one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring
When someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Though he has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
He's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to him I'm creeping
My very soul is in his keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring
When someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Though he has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
I'm yours awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to you I'm creeping
My very soul is in your keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
I had a heart so true
Now I have none, and you have two
So don't give me the runaround
'Cause you know I'm forever bound
To be your prisoner
Of love
