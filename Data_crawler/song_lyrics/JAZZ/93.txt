Song Name: Waves
Is there something after there was nothing to say?
We're just moving in circles but we're losing our shape
Oh, where did all the good things go?
(Where did they go? Where did they go?)
Oh, falling out of love too slow

It's a beautiful morning, don't throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you'd wish for the rain
Do you even notice what I'm tryna say?
If I gave you the ocean, you'd complain 'bout the waves
Guess there's nothing, feels like I'm not doing this right
Like a star that slowly disappears in the night
Oh, where did all the good things go?
(Where did they go? Where did they go?)
Oh, falling out of love too slow
(It's too slow)
It's a beautiful morning, don't throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you'd wish for the rain
Do you even notice what I'm tryna say?
If I gave you the ocean, you'd complain 'bout the waves
It's a beautiful morning, don't throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you'd wish for the rain
Do you even notice what I'm tryna say?
If I gave you the ocean, you'd complain 'bout the waves
