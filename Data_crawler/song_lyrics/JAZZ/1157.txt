Song Name: Alien Boy
I fell down to Earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
Three doors down so you can't ignore it
I'll hunt you down like a tyrannosaurus
My teeth are sharp like a great white shark
Let me taste that flesh, it's my favourite part
Got an eagle beak with the ostrich feet
Seven spider eyes for every day of the week
Means I'm still up working while your bitch ass sleeps
I'm an alien among the human beings
I fell down to Earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
Ten doors down but you still can't see me
I talk a lot of shit so you won't believe me
I really wouldn't say anything else
I shouldn't be standing here all by myself
'Cause I'm out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I told you I was out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I fell down to Earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
I won't be here long at all
I fell down to Earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
