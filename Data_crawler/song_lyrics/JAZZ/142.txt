Song Name: Light Switch - Acoustic
Yeah, uh
Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh-huh-uh)
But I hit right back 'cause you got that, that, yeah (uh)
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each other's (uh-huh-uh)
I say don't look back, but I go right back, yeah
All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (yeah)
You know how to just make me want you, baby
Do you love it when you keep me guessin'? (Me guessin')
When you leave and then you leave me stressin' (me stressin', uh-huh-uh, uh-huh-uh)
But I can't stay mad when you walk like that, no (uh)
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each other's (uh-huh-uh, uh-huh-uh)
I say don't look back, but I go right back, yeah
All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized (hypnotized)
You're the one that I can't deny (can't deny)
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away (yeah)
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch (switch)
When you're movin' your body around and around ('round)
You got me in a tight grip (grip)
You know how to just make me want you, baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and show me how you do (you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wanting you (me wanting you, girl)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and show me (how you) how you do (how you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want (oh-oh, yeah)
You wanna keep me wanting you
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this
You know how to just make me want to
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip
You know how to just make me want you, baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and show me (how) how you do (how you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want (wanna keep me wanting you)
You wanna keep me wanting you (baby)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and show me how you do (you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wanting you
