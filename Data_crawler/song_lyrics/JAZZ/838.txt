Song Name: Navajo
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I... until I...
I love you, I love you, I love, you
Until I find the...
Say the only words I know that you'll
Until I... until I... say the only words I know that you'll... until I...
I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She picks up another obstacle
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me
I thought she was an indian (Navajo)
Now she's slangin' thangs like a simian (now I know) uh
All my life, I wanted me an indian (there she goes)
Now she's far away
But I had to know
Listen, I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She picks up another obstacle, ah
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me
I thought she was an indian, woo (Navajo)
Now she's slangin' thangs like a simian (now I know)
All my life, I wanted me an indian (there she goes)
Ooh girl, let me in (oh-oh)
In the street
With a wedding ring
And she hit the bar
City babe, are you down to cheat?
He looked in her eye
Chivalry, is it really dead?
He pulled out a tip? (Pay up)
Jumpin' right on him
Thinkin' when's it good to intervene
Then I lost her
Lost her to the world and the girls and impostors
Entertain? I doubt it'll pay and it cost her
I ain't mad at me but it hurts
I thought she was an indian (Navajo), uh
Now she only worried bout' the Benjamin's, eh, ah (grab the gold)
She's been lookin' in my dreams (there she goes)
I swear that eye's on me
But I had to know
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
