Song Name: Like U
I love the way
You look away
You think you are
A freak, a whore
Let me tell you
A thing or two
I got a kink
'Bout girls like you
About girls
(About girls)
Like you
I'd like to have
Some time with you
My hand, your lips
My head, your grip
Let me tell you
A thing or two
I got a kink
'Bout girls like you
About girls
(About girls)
Like you
About girls
Like you
