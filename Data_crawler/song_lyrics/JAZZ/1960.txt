Song Name: You Are Woman I Am Man
You are woman, I am man
You are smaller, so I can be taller then
You are softer to the touch
It's a feeling I like feeling very much
You are someone I've admired
Still our friendship leaves something to be desired
Does it take more explanation than this?
You are woman, I am man
You are woman, I am man, let's kiss
Does it take more explanation than this?
You are woman, I am man
You are woman, I am man, let's kiss
