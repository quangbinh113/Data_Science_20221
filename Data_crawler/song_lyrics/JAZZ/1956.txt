Song Name: Come Fly With Me - Remastered 1998
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me
Let's take off in the blue
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say the words
And we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
You just say the words
And we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly
Pack up, let's fly away
