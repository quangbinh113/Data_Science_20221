Song Name: The Twelveth of Never
You ask how much I love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelveth of never
I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Love my heart
Like a brand new snow
I'll love you till the blue bells
Forget to bloom
And baby I'll love you
Till the roses have lost their perfume
I'll love you till the poets run out of rhymes
Until the twelveth of never
And that's a long long time
