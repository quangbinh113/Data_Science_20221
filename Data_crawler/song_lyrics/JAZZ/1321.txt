Song Name: Where Are You?
I've been trying to figure out
Where you're from?
What are you talking about?
Is it the moon? (Is it the moon?)
Is it earth? (Is it earth)
Is it a place where nothing is worth?
A million dollars, a thousand colors
A billion faces, a hundred death cases
Is it there or is it here?
Where you're hiding? I just want you to come in

Where you're hiding? I just want you to come in
Nothing can compare to the love we have
My dear, just grab my hand and let me take you
To my wonderland
A million dollars, a thousand colors
A billion faces, a hundred death cases
Is it there or is it here?
Where you're hiding? I just want you to come in
Where you're hiding? I just want you to come in
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
