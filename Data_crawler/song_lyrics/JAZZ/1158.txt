Song Name: Hurt
My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only one, your dying love
I've seen enough
I tried but, I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but
It seems like it never really was enough
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how, you've been let down
Don't speak unless you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life you had an attitude
One day, is this so bad for you?
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back
I tried but, I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but
It seems like it never really was enough
I changed my, whole life when
I learned to, ignore them
I changed my, whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back
I tried but, I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but
It seems like it never really was enough
