Song Name: Love, Me
I read a note my grandma wrote
Back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat
And he showed it once to me
He said
"Boy, you might not understand
But a long long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none
But I loved your grandma so
We had this crazy plan to meet
And run away together
Get married in the first town
We came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree
Where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter
And this is what it said
"If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down
Darlin', wait and see
And between now and then
Until I see you again
I'll be loving you
Love, me"
I read those words just hours
Before my grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church
Where me and grandpa stopped to pray
I know I've never seen him cry
In all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her
His eyes filled up with tears
"If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down
Darlin', wait and see
And between now and then
Until I see you again
I'll be loving you
Love, me
Between now and then
Until I see you again
I'll be loving you
Love, me
