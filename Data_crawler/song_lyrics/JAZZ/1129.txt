Song Name: Yee
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening
Or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people
Who don't even care about my wellbeing
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party
I'll be here somewhere in the corner
On the clouds on marijuana
With this boy who's hot and I can hardly hear
Oh, with this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh, here
Oh, here
Oh, I asked myself, "What am I doing here?"
Oh, here
Oh, here
Oh
Here
And I can't wait so we can break about the here
Keep me fasting
A little unimpressed with this, an antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't so bad to me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it
And just listen to some music with a message
And we'll discuss our big dreams, our weekends
And take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
Are we here?
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
Don't tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh, here
Oh, here
Oh, I asked myself, "What am I doing here?"
Oh, here
Oh, here
And I can't wait so we can break about the
Oh, here
Oh, here
Oh, I asked myself, "What am I doing here?"
Oh, here
Oh, here
And I can't wait so we can break about the here
Here
Here
