Song Name: A Lover's Concerto
How gentle is the rain that falls softly on the meadow
Birds high above in the trees serenade the flowers with their melodies oh oh oh
See there beyond the hill the bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above made this day for us just to fall in love
Now I belong to you from this day until forever
Just love me tenderly and I'll give to you every part of me oh oh oh
Don't ever make me cry through long lonely nights without love
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally
Someday we shall return to this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain, hear the bird's above sing once again oh oh oh
You'll hold me in your arms and say once again, you love me
And if your love is true everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms and say once again, you love me
And if your love is true everything will be just as wonderful
