Song Name: Get Lucky
Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning, ah-ah
We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon
You're a gift that keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you wanna live, I'm with it, ah-ah
We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Hoo, we're up all night to get lucky
