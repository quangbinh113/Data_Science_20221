Song Name: You've Got A Friend
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing oh nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
Soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend
If the sky, above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon, you'll hear me knocking upon your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
Well they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh but don't you let them
Call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you got to do is call and I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
