Song Name: Passing Strangers
(Billy)We seem like passing strangers now
How can you hurry by (Sarah)There where never two who loved
Half as much as you and IWe seem like passing strangers now
Funny how things can change (Billy)We where so inseparable
Now you're acting very strange (Both)The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello (Billy)How I miss your lips you'll never know (Sarah)If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then (Both)Strangers can be lovers again (Sarah)The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello (Billy)How I miss your lips you'll never know
If you would only turn to me (Both)Speak my name just once more (Sarah)You might find right there and then (Both)Strangers can be lovers again
