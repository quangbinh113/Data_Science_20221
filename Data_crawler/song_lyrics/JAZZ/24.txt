Song Name: Figment Of My Mind
I traveled into deep space to see what I could find
A purple angel led me to the universe inside
Welcome to the real world, not the dream you left behind
It was all a figment of your mind
We flew amongst the patterns, impossible designs
They'd been there the whole time hidden by my eyes
If I'd had a body, it surely would've cried
But tears were a figment of my mind
Waking with eyes closed from technicolor dreams
Crystal kaleidoscopes were singing blue and green
Realer than real in front of me
If only you could see what I could see
I was shown a few things I'd been getting wrong
She told me I'm a good man and have been all along
By the way I heard her say, there's no such thing as time
It's all a figment of your mind
Waking with eyes closed from technicolor dreams
Crystal kaleidoscopes were singing blue and green
Realer than real in front of me
If only you could see what I could see
I slowly found my body, color began to fade
I heard a piano playing a knowing serenade
This world feels backwards to my open eyes
'Cause it's all a figment of my mind
