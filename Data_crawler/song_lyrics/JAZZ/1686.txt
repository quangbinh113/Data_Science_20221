Song Name: If I Were a Bell
Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cozy and clinging
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I just got to behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light
Or if I were a banner I'd wave
Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch I'd start
Popping my spring
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong ding
Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bridge I'd be burning
Yes, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked
Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Pal, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a bell
Yes, if I were a bell, if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong ding
