Song Name: I Diddle
Hey diddle diddle
And the cat and the fiddle
And the cow jumped over the
Moon
A little dog lied to see such a
Sport
And the dish ran away with the
Spoon
There was a little girl
Who had a little curl
Right in the middle of her
Forehead
When she was good she was very
Very good
But when she was bad she was
Horrid
La lala lalala...
Humpty dumpty sat on the wall
Humpty dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the
King's men
Could'nt put humpty together
Again
Georgi porgi pudding and pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
When the boys came out to play
Georgi porgi ran away
La lala lalala...
Old king cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
He called for his pipe
And called for his bowl
And called for his fiddles three
And every fiddler had a fiddle so
Fine
And a very fine fiddle had he
There's none so rare as can
Compare
With old king cole and his fiddlers
Three
La lala lalala...
