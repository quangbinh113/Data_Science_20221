Song Name: Come As You Are
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As a known enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend
As a known memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As a known memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria (and I don't have a gun)
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
(Memoria)
(Memoria)
