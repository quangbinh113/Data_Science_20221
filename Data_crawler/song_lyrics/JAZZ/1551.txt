Song Name: I Didn't Know What Time It Was
I didn't know what time it was then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was you held my hand
Warm like the month of may it was and I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice
Say I'm all your own
I did not know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, hear your voice, feel your touch
Say I'm all your own
I did not know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now
I didn't know what time it was then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was you held my hand
Warm like the month of may it was and I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, hear your voice, feel your touch
Say I'm all your own
I didn't know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now
