Song Name: She Make It Clap
Draco, Soulja
She make it clap, clap, clap

She make it clap, clap, clap, ooh-uh
She make it clap
Ride around town with the strap in my lap, ooh, yeah
She make it clap
I'm tryna grab and then hit from the back
Told her, "Drop it down" 'cause I like that
After I hit then I be right back
I walk in the club then whip out them racks
I'm blowing on gas, she doing her dance
She making it clap, I might have a heart attack
I walk in the club, and I'm making it rain with them stacks
She drop it to the ground, she know that it fat
I run through that sack when I thumb through them racks
I whip up that dough, boy, I'm fresh out the trap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
I hit from the back
Walk in the club and I thumb through them racks (ooh)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it (ooh)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it (yeah, yeah-yeah)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap, yeah (uh)
