Song Name: Fantasy
Every man has a place
In his heart, there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship Fantasy
All your dreams will come true right away
And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one
Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to the kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship Fantasy
All your dreams will come true miles away
Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live love forever as one
Come to see victory in a land called Fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy
You will find (you will find) other kind (other kind)
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize (recognize), it's your life, now in review (ooh)
And as you stay for the play fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day all your dreams come true (ah)
Come to see victory in a land called Fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy (ah)
You will find other kind (ooh)
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life, now in review (ah)
