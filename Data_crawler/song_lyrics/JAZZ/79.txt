Song Name: Just You
I've been alone for a while
I've been lost and found
I don't know what I been doin'
I thought this loneliness
Will be for a while
I have no reason to keep this smile
And here comes the light
That really show me what is real
Deep in the ocean
You become my lover and my bestfriend
Tell me everything about you
Never felt like this before
The love feels so true
Every little thing that you do
Ain't exaggerating but no
I won't take two
Just you
Your kisses ease my doubts
Words of love like shooting stars
You pulled me outta dark
The heart you leave the mark
Like a sunset after the rain you're so colorful
Like the ocean so complexly beautiful
I wanna dive so deep
I wanna hear your story
I want to help you grow
I want you help me grow
My search is over (Search is over)
I got this covered (I got this covered)
I don't know what I be without you now
Tell me everything about you
Never felt like this before
The love feels so true
Every little thing that you do
Ain't exaggerating but no
I won't take two
Just you
Tell me everything about you
Your kisses ease my doubts
Words of love like shooting stars
You pulled me outta dark
The heart you leave the mark
Like a sunset after the rain you're so colorful
Like the ocean so complexly beautiful
