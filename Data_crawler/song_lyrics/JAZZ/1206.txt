Song Name: Cirque
Hear her talkin' 'bout that mainstream
Got it real easy, like she got the call back
Droppin' underneath that eave breeze
Wanna watch her knees weak
When they pass my name by
You know you sound cocky as fuck
But go and try, good fuckin' luck
So, if you ask to come and see me
Show some fuckin' dignity
Don't tell me how to live life
And I make it go (boom) back at it again
Don't need to be in love to have a little romance
Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
And even if they're petrified
I hear their hearts prance
And I can be free from raw tyranny
And fuck my emotions, they're ghostin'
And moanin', all day on repeat
We can fall in love or we can go insane
We can play it rough or we can, we can play it safe
Don't matter what's above, our destinies are made
Why give us fuckin' lemons
If I can just buy lemonade?
And I make it go (boom) back at it again
Don't need to be in love to have a little romance
Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
And even if they're petrified
I hear their hearts prance
And I can be free from raw tyranny
And fuck my emotions, they're ghostin'
And moanin', all day on repeat
('Round and around we go)
('Round and around we go)
