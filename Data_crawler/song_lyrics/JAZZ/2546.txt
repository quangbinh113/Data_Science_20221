Song Name: I'll Look Around
I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you
I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I'll look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew
I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I'll look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew
