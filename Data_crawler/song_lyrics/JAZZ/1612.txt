Song Name: My Funny Valentine
My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
You're looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
