Song Name: Rise
Our dreams will burn
Inside us like a fire, like a fire
This world will turn
Like the tides when we rise, when we rise
Nothing's gonna hold us down
No one's gonna stop us now
We'll push until we overcome, whoaaa!
This fire that burns inside
They can see it in our eyes
So far above it all we'll rise
We will rise, ooohh!
There's a change in the air
I can feel that electricity
That light will shine, shine so bright
When we rise, when we rise
Nothing's gonna hold us down
No one's gonna stop us now
We'll push until we overcome, whoaaa!
This fire that burns inside
They can see it in our eyes
So far above it all we'll rise
We will rise, ooohh!
Nothing's gonna hold us down
No one's gonna stop us now
We'll push until we overcome, whoaaa!
This fire that burns inside
They can see it in our eyes
So far above it all we'll rise
We will rise
Nothing's gonna hold us down
No one's gonna stop us now
We'll push until we overcome, whoaaa!
This fire that burns inside
They can see it in our eyes
So far above it all we'll rise
We will rise, ooohh!
