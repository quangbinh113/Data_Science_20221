Song Name: Again
Last night stuck in my mind
On the floor all of our things
Ten degrees, a bottle of wine
Won't you come over again?
How cold can it get here?
Should I wash my sheets?
Will you come back in?
I don't wanna get rid of your traces
And then you disappear with no mercy
Girl you did something to me
And tonight I want it again
One, two, three, four
I want more
One, two, three, four
You want more
One, two, three, four
I want more
One, two, three, four
You know you want more
