Song Name: We're Going U.F.O.-Ing
If you whan to get a thrill
If you want to see he sites
Jump right in
I got an Unidentified flying object, yeah
Lets go for a spin
Were goin u.f.o-ing
Were tryin saucer flyin'
We've flied across the skies
No body will believe there eyes
Just when they think they've seen us
We zoom away to Venus
One moment were in Mexico
Like that were over Idaho, just tell me were you wanna go in my ufo
Were goin u.f.o-ing
Were tryin saucer flyin'
We've flied across the skies
No body will believe there eyes
Just when they think they've seen us
We zoom away to Venus
One moment were in Mexico
Like that were over Idaho, just tell me were you wanna go in my ufo
Were goin u.f.o-ing
Were tryin saucer flyin'
We've flied across the skies
No body will believe there eyes
Just when they think they've seen us
We zoom away to Venus
One moment were in Mexico
Like that were over Idaho, just tell me were you wanna go in my ufo
Were goin u.f.o-ing
Were tryin saucer flyin'
We've flied across the skies
No body will believe there eyes
Just when they think they've seen us
We zoom away to Venus
One moment wee in Mexico
Like that were over Idaho, just tell me were you wanna go in my ufo
