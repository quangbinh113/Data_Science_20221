Song Name: Barking
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mokuba Lives Beats
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I'm icey
I got a tick from my head to my feet, that's Nike
And that's pricey
You see them guys over there they ain't like me
I got a Portuguese ting not wifey
She said my temper's tiny
I got two different worlds like Miley
You hit me up that's unlikely (Likely)
But I walked in the rain with a fresh trim (Fresh trim)
Showing my Colgate teeth (My teeth)
Yeah, they're looking like me (Lookin' at me)
Saying, can I get a pic for the 'Gram, just like AJ T
No wonder they hate on me
'Cause I'm making P's and they see these clothes
Yeah, I get 'em for free
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
Many guys
Many, many, many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, too bad I don't look like you
Like many many many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, like too bad
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
