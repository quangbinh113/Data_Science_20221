Song Name: Midnight At The Oasis
Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to a sand dune real soon
Kick up a little dust
Come on the cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on 'till the evening ends
'Till the evening ends
You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer
Prancer and you can be my sheik
I know your daddy's a sultan
A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him
They all send him
Jump at his beck and call
But you won't need no harem
Honey
When I am by your side
And you won't need no camel
No no when I take you for a ride
Come on the cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on 'till the evening ends
'Till the evening ends
Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Oh, come on (repeat)
