Song Name: Until I Found You - Piano Version
Georgia
Wrap me up in all your
I want ya in my arms
Oh, let me hold ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

Georgia
Pulled me in, I asked to love her
Once again you fell, I caught ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, l used to say
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
