Song Name: Your Home
It doesn't matter who you are with
It's doesn't' matter where you go
And I don't care if you are broke
You always can give me a call
And if we had a single dollar
For every time we screw it up
I guess we'd live inside a mansion
With Lamborghini and Porsche lined up
So when you're lost
I will always be your home
Open wide
Doesn't matter where you've roamed
So when you're lost
I'm gonna always be your home
When you're lost
When you're lost
When you're lost
