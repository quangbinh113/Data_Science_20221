Song Name: Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)
Who can I turn to
When no body needs me
My heart wantss to know and so Imust go where
Desitny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way and after the day
The darkness will hide me
And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away
