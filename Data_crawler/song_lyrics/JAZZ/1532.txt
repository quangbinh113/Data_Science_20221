Song Name: When I Fall in Love (feat. Chris Botti)
When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel
That you feel the same way too
Is when I fall in love with you
In a restless world, oh, like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart, oh, it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart, oh
And the moment I can feel
That you feel the same way too

Is when I fall in love with you
