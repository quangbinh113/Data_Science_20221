Song Name: Everything Black
Shadows fall over my heart
I blackout the moon
I wait for you to come around
You got me dancing in the dark
(Dancing in the dark)
I've closed my eyes
But I won't sleep tonight
Baby, you
Should come with me
I'll take you to the dark side
Me and you
You and me
Do bad things in the nighttime
Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout
Hit the lights let it blackout, blackout (woo!)
Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart, black keys, black diamonds
Blackout, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything, black
In a nocturnal state of mind
Children of the night
But it's the only way of life
This black hole's pulling me inside
Of this black heart, the black soul
Underneath this black, black sky
Baby, you
Should come with me
I'll take you to the dark side
Me and you
You and me
Do bad things in the nighttime
Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout
Hit the lights let it blackout, blackout (woo!)
Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart, black keys, black diamonds
Blackout, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything, black
Baby, you
Should come with me
Me and you
You and me
Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout
Hit the lights with a blackout, blackout
Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart, black keys, black diamonds
Blackout, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything
All black, everything, everything, black
