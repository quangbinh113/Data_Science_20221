Song Name: Jocelyn Flores
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've be feelin'-
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're somethin', we're nothin'
I've been stuck thinkin' 'bout her, I can't hold on (I've be feelin'-)
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl, that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
I wanna fuckin' end it
Pessimistic
Always wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'
At the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up
I've be feelin' pain
I've be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same
I'm so numb
I've been feelin' pain
I've be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

I know you so wellâ€”I know you, girl
I mean, I can do anything he can
I've been feelin'-
I know you so well
