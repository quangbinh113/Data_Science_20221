Song Name: Am I Blue? - Take 2
Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you?
Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Each plan with my man done fell through
Was a time I was his only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, Lordy
Was I gay 'til today?
Now he's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
Was I gay 'til today?
Now he's gone, and we're through
Am I blue?
Oh he's gone, he left me
Am I blue?
