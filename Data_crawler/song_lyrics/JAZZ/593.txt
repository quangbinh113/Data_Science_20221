Song Name: Before I Fall in Love
My heart says we've got something real
Can I trust the way I feel
Cause my heart's been fooled before
Am I just seeing what I want to see
Or is it true could you really be
Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know before I fall in love
Someone who'll stay around
Through all my ups and downs
Please tell me now before I fall in love
I'm at the point of no return, So afraid of getting burned
But I want to take a chance, Please give me a reason to believe
Say you're the one that you'll always be
Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know before I fall in love
Someone who'll stay around, Through all my ups and downs
Please tell me now before I fall in love
It's been so hard for me to give my heart away
But I would give my everything, Just to hear you say
Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know before I fall in love
Someone who'll stay around, Through all my ups and downs
Please tell me now before I fall in love
Before I fall in love
