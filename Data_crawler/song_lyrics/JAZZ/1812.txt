Song Name: Take My Breath Away
Watching in slow motion
In my foolish lover's game
In this endless motion
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated one
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Through the hourglass I saw you in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you and turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am not afraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
