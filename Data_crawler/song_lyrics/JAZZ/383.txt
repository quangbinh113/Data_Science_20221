Song Name: Way Too Long
Hey, yo, yo
It's Stack Rack
Nathan Dawe
Anne-Marie
Really wanna call ya, yeah, yeah
But if I called you up, would that be wrong?
It's funny how I love ya, yeah, yeah
Then suddenly you're nothing but a song
Summer in the back of your car
Singin' Drake in the dark
I've been reminiscing 'bout our love
I can't help but think about you and the way that it was
I wish I could let go of us
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Been way too long, long (hey, yo, yo)
Since you've been gone (stacka)
It's been way too long, come see me, please
She said it's way too long, she can't handle me (haha)
I know you're a good girl, be bad for me (bad)
My money pretty like Anne-Marie (pretty man)
Don't want one wife, tryna marry three (woo)
Forget quality, I want quantity (more)
If you done me wrong don't bother me (don't)
Forget sorry, no qualities
Ah, I like your style, could you whine for me?
Yeah, do that same dance as Cardi B (Bardi)
I can't lie, man, I need your girl (haha)
No, I'm jokin', I need Adele
Or even Mabel's good for me
Just fun, no label, that's good for me
You's the chick I need
Hmm, it's Jade from Little Mix for me, what you sayin' B?
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (oh, ooh-ooh)
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone
Summer in the back of your car
Singin' Drake in the dark
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
I can't help but think about you and the way that it was
Baby, I should let go of us
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Oh-woah, oh, oh, oh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Oh-woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Oh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone (it's been way too long)
