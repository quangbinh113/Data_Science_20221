Song Name: Sugar & Brownies
Some keep a diary
Seems like a fantasy
But it may require some love and desire
It's something to cover me
There's never a guarantee
That loving is so easy
Some may define it as sugar and brownies
But sour just as lime is
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
Some of the ocean breeze
Somewhere you promised me
A love like a fire, no fears, no denial
Just something to gladden me
I feel electricity
Your lighting is guiding me
I fear that I like it
No place we can hide it
So hard not to find it
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
The reason why we don't give up on our love is simple
We're like the sun and moon
We like to see each other shining bright
We have tonight, tomorrow
And the other days that follow
We have to try to make things right
I'll sing to you like
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
Ooh, nai-a-nai
Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
Nai, na-na-nai
The reason, the reason, the reason why
