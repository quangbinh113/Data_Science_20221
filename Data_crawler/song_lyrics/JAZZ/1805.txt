Song Name: The Look Of Love
The look of love is in your eyes
A look your smile can't disguise
The look of love
It's saying so much more than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard, well, it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got that look of love
Is on your face
The look that time can't erase
Be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you, don't ever go
Don't ever go, I love you so
I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you, don't ever go

Don't ever go, don't ever go
