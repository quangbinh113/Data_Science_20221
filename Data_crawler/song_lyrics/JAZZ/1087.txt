Song Name: What I Want
All I want is something new
'Cause I just want to be with you
All those fairy tales I know
Are like our story, kiss and go
I'll be walking every day
Up to meet you on my way
When you gotta let me know
What I want is to be with you
Nothing gonna set me from you, my baby
Everything I do is for you, my baby
What I want
What I want
Is there nothing we could do?
Is there something without you?
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to trust your lies
I'll be walking every day
Up to meet you on my way
When you gotta let me know
What I want is to be with you
Nothing gonna set me from you, my baby
Everything I do is for you, my baby
What I want
What I want
