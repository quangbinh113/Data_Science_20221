Song Name: If You Were the Rain
If you were the rain
I would pray
Lord it's too dry every night
Yes, if you were the rain
And I was outside, no
I wouldn't run
I wouldn't hide
I'd just look up to the sky and I'd say
That's okay, cause today
Well I wanna play in the rain
That's alright, I don't mind
A little time with no sunshine
Well someday you'll fall
Like rain into my arms
And finally leave the sky
You thought was home
Forecast calls for rain
Says you're coming soon, well
You know exactly what I'm gonna do
I'd just look up to the sky and I'd say
That's okay, cause today
Well I wanna play in the rain
That's alright, I don't mind
A little time with no sunshine
Girl go ahead and start raining
If you were the rain I'd be saying
Girl go ahead and start raining
If you were the rain I'd be saying
That's okay, cause today
Well I wanna play in the rain
That's alright, I don't mind
A little time with no sunshine
