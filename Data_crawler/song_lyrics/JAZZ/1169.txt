Song Name: Make Your Own Kind Of Music
Nobody can tell you
There's only one song worth singin'
They may try and sell you
'Cause it hangs them up
To see someone like you
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You're gonna be nowhere
The loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough going
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
So if you cannot take my hand
And if you must be going, I will understand
You've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
