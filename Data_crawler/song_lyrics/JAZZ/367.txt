Song Name: Worth It
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff, guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'ma call you bluff, hurry up, I'm waitin' out front
Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight, "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, see me in the spotlight, "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got now, come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue
Not a clue, I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because I don't like it, like it too soft
Not too much, but maybe just enough
Not too much, but maybe just enough
Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight, "ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, see me in the spotlight, "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got now, come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (Know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (Give me everything)
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight, "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got 'cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh, see me in the spotlight, "Ooh, I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got now, come and make it worth my while
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (Know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (Give me everything)
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
