Song Name: bandaids - live sessions
You should have told me
I dont know what to say
Why are you sorry
How did it get this way
My heart is broken
Down to my core
It's not what I wanted
I don't know what I want anymore
I'm afraid that band-aids are no good for heartache
Not okay so tell me when your world is falling down
Afraid of falling down
The fire has started right behind me
If I dont jump now
I fear that I can't take the burning
I can't hear a sound
Nothing that I say can hurt me
Dive into the ground
I fear that I can't take the burning
I'm afraid that band-aids are no good for heartache
Not okay so tell me when your world is falling down
Friends of flowers
Fragile silence
Stand beside you
Stop your crying
I'm afraid that band-aids are no good for heartache
Not okay so tell me when your world is falling down
