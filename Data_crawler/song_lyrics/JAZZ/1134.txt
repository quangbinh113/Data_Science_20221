Song Name: Way down We Go
Oh, Father, tell me
Do we get what we deserve?
Oh, we get what we deserve
And way down we go, go, go, go, go
Way down we go, go, go, go, go
Say way down we go
Way down we go
Oh, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all fall, go down
Yeah, but for the fall, ooh, my
Do you dare to look him right in the eyes? Yeah
Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down 'til the dark
Yes and they will run you down, down 'til you fall
And they will run you down, down to your core
Yeah, so you can't crawl no more
And way down we go, go, go, go
Oh, way down we go
Say way down we go, ooh
Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down to your core
Oh, way down we go
Oh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby, ah-ha
Baby, ooh
Way down we go
Oh, no
Yeah! No, oh, no
Way down we go, go, go, go, go
Oh, way down we go
Say way down we go, ooh
Way down we go
