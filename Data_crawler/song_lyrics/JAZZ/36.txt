Song Name: On Our Own
I tried to tell Him there's pain here
And suffering too
I tried to pray, but the angels said
"We're too busy for you"
I had a talk with my Mama about losing my beliefs
'Cause since she lost her Mama
The Lord's been helping with her grief
She said He might just be a big story
But there's more to life than truth
There's hope, my son in peoples faith
Gives them strength to pull through
But what if the world is a hopeless place?
We're just scared to admit we're alone
What if the world is a hopeless place?
And we're on our own
We're on our own
There's beauty in nature
And parables from kingdoms we knew
I'm not expecting much after
I'll make the most of my dues
'Cause I believe He's just story
And I'm looking for the truth
I have faith in my own journey
With those I love to help me through
'Cause I know the world is a beautiful place
Too full of love to be alone
I know the world is a beautiful place
But we're on our own
We're on our own
