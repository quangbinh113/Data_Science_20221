Song Name: skeletons
Stressed out
Feelin' lost and I don't what to do now
What I chose ain't really gonna work out
Fallin' six feet underneath the floor now
Think I'm gonna tap out
Feel bad, go to bed
Wake up even worse, yeah
So sad in my head
Feelin' like a curse
I need medicine, medicine, medicine
All my skeletons out for the taking
I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it
All my skeletons out for the taking
Somebody take 'em
I wanna ride away
The day to day is taking its toll on me
And I'm tearing at the seams
Throw it all away
Give a fuck about what they say
I gotta disagree
This ain't really fun for me
Feel bad, go to bed
Wake up even worse, yeah
So sad in my head
Feelin' like a curse
I need medicine, medicine, medicine
All my skeletons out for the taking
I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it
All my skeletons out for the taking
Somebody take 'em
