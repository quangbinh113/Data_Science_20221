Song Name: I've Got a Crush On You
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with such emotion
Could you coo, could you care?
For a little cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
Could you coo, could you care?
For a country cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
My baby, on you...
My baby, on you...
My baby, on you...
