Song Name: June
I had to go
I had to steal away
I left her love inside of yesterday
And still her words
They leave me wondering what I'm looking for

And im sing ooh I want I wanna find her
Back in the place she said she would wait
I want I wanna find her
Yes I will, ohh yes I will
Now I know I do it to myself
I get lost in the game thinking I need your help
But don't reach for me
I'll only push you away like I did before
Don't wanna hurt anymore
But ooh I want I wanna find her
I told her to go but I want her to stay
Ooh I want I wanna find her
Yes I will and I love you still
But you wanted this
You've given in to your heart again
And if, come next June
I find you without much to do
Would I join you?
