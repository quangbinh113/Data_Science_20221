Song Name: I'm Glad There Is You
In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures
And underrated treasures
I'm glad there is you
I live to love, I love to live
With you beside me
This role so new I'll muddle through
With you to guide me
In this world where many many play at love
But hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever
I'm glad there is you
