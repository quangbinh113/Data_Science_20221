Song Name: Never Mine (Acoustic)
Why do you say the things you say?
Then go and do the things you do
And then you act like you don't even care
One day you're asking if I'm free
The next you call to cancel on me
The night before our plans always fall through
Now I'm holding onto nothing
The whole time I was feeling something
But you, you were never mine
So don't be afraid to break my heart
Don't be afraid to speak your part
Don't be afraid to tell me you're tired of trying
I might be scared to let this go
But better you tell me so I know
I would just thank you later for being honest
What'd I do wrong? Was I not enough?
Were there other girls or did you just give up?
Said you needed time so I gave all mine to you
And I hate how I don't hate you
I hate how I don't blame you
I hate how you don't feel the same
Now I'm holding onto nothing
The whole time I was feeling something
But you, you were never mine
So don't be afraid to break my heart
Don't be afraid to speak your part
Don't be afraid to tell me you're tired of trying
I might be scared to let this go
But better you tell me so I know
I would just thank you later for being honest
I know that we weren't really a thing
Got me thinkin' 'bout what we could have been
You kept me holding on for too long
It's time I let you know that I'm so gone
I don't deserve to be second choice
These the type of feelings you just can't force
So man up, don't waste my time
It hurts, but you were never mine
You were never mine
Now I'm holding onto nothing
The whole time I was feeling something
But you, you were never mine
