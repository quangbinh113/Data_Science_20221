Song Name: Let's Spend The Night Together - Live
"Let's Spend The Night Together"
Now don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind, oh no
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time, oh no
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongue's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
I feel so strong, I can't describe, oh no
But I just won't apologize, oh no
I'll satisfy your every need (your every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh, my-my-my-my-my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
You know I'm smiling, baby
You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby, now
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
Yeah
I feel so strong, I can't describe, oh no
But I just won't apologize, oh no
I'll satisfy your every need (every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh, my-my-my-my-my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
Yeah, I need you baby
Yeah, more than ever now
Yeah, more than ever now
I need you, sugar, more than ever now
Yeah, my-my-my-my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, hey
