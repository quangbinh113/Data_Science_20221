Song Name: Love Never Felt So Good
Baby, love never felt so good
And I always knew it would
'Cause when you hold me, hold me
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I think about the time
Somebody told me, they told me
When you find the one who wants your heart
Give it up, never stop
Don't look back for a moment
'Cause, baby, every time I see you
In and out of my life, something tells me
Baby, I should try to get you
More and more in my life, 'cause when I'm with you
Baby, love never felt so good
Baby, love never felt so right
Like it does with you tonight
Taking it slowly, so slowly
Oh, baby, baby, feel the way I do
Second nature holding you
Why don't you show me, show me
When you find the one who wants your heart
Let it go, make the show
Don't look back, just go forward
'Cause, baby, every time I see you
In and out of my life, I go crazy
Baby, I just got to get you
More and more in my life, when I'm with you
Baby, love never felt so good
I know want to, want to, baby
Girl, why don't you let go
Don't look back, never stop
Don't look back, just go forward
'Cause, baby, every time I see you
In and out of my life, I go crazy
Baby, I just got to get you
More and more in my life, when I'm with you
Baby, love never felt so good
Love never felt so good
It never felt so good
Love never felt so good
It never felt so good
Love never felt so good
It never felt so good
Love never felt so good
It never felt so good
