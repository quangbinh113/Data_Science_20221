Song Name: Roses
Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know
You already know
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is-
Turn up baby, turn up
When I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
(And I know you won't tell nobody no)
Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell your girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the-
Turn up baby, turn up
When I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna-
Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know
You already know
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is-
Turn up baby, turn up
When I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna-
Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell your girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the God is
You know who the-
Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know
