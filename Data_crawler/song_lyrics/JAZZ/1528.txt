Song Name: The Sweetest Sounds
The sweetest sounds
I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words
I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said
The most entrancing
Sight of all
Is yet for me to see
And the dearest love
In all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere,
Somewhere for me
The sweetest sounds
I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words
I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said
The most entrancing
Sight of all
Is yet for me to see
And the dearest love
In all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere,
Somewhere for me
