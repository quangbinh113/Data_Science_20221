Song Name: New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York what the Apple's susposed to be
Ah New York, New York
New York, New York
New York is the headline galaxy
Ah yeah
Subway flights
Broadway brights
Lights and sights and a million delights
Thrill, thrill, thrill
Sugar, hill still
On Washington Heights
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
What the Apple's susposed to be
New York is a song
New York is the dance
New York is a summer-fall, spring-fall, winter-fall romance
New York is the glitter
New York is the glamour
New York is the sunswept star lit moonshine super grand-slammer
Ah yeah
Subway flights
Broadway brights
Lights and sights and a million delights
Thrill, thrill, thrill
Sugar, hill still
On Washington heights
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
What the Apple susposed
Susposed to be
Headline galaxy
But most most to me
What the Apple's supposed to be
Dancing, romancing, New York
