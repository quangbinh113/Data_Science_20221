Song Name: Do You Feel Like I Feel
Hey, little sister,
Have you heard the news today?
We're gonna shape the world away
Hey, little darling,
Have you seen the skies in grey?
Our love has cleared the clouds away
Stop, look and listen to your heart
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna make the church bells sing
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna let our freedom ring
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna give you everything
Oh do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna let our freedom ring, oh
Sweet, little sister,
Let's get together with our souls
And letï¸¿ move on beyond a goal
Hey, little darling,
I see the flowers in your eyes,
So innocent and wise
Start looking and listen to my heart
Oh do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna make the church bells sing
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna let our freedom ring
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna give you everything
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna let our freedom ring, oh
Hey, come on with me, sweet, soul sister;
My soul sister
(Do you feel like I feel?)
(Do you feel like I feel?)
(Do you feel like I feel?)
Sweet, soul sister; sweet, soul sister
(Do you feel like I feel?)
(Do you feel like I feel?)
(Do you feel like I feel?)
End
