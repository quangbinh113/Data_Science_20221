Song Name: Wouldn't Mean A Thing
I could climb the Himalayan mountains
Or the pyramids in West Peru
I could travel back in time and hear Al Green sing
It wouldn't mean a thing without you
I could sail across the Indian Ocean
And bathe in the reflection of the moon
I could find the buried treasure of ancient kings
But it wouldn't mean a thing without you
No, wouldn't mean a thing without you
You bring out the best in me
Help me see the world differently
Be a better man than I'd ever be on my own
I'll give you the rest of me
You're the reason I rest easily
It's the love and loyalty you've shown
I could work hard, make a fortune
Bet it all on red only to lose
If money comes my way I won't be complaining
It wouldn't mean a thing without you
No, it wouldn't mean a thing without you
You bring out the best in me
Help me see the world differently
Be a better man than I'd ever be on my own
I'll give you the rest of me
You're the reason I rest easily
It's the love and loyalty you've shown
I could climb the Himalayan mountains
Or the pyramids in West Peru
I could travel back in time and hear Al Green sing
It wouldn't mean a thing with out you
No, it wouldn't mean a thing without you
