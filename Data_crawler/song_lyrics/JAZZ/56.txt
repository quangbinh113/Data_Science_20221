Song Name: Twenty Something
We were young and bold
Twenty something years old
Where the eyes closed
We thought we know where we would go
We were a team, we were a tandem
Baby, we were really something
Maybe we're too young for the part
Don't you find yourself asking these questions
Like giving it another chance and
Maybe we're just better apart
I don't even wanna know why we became just a bunch of photographs
Doesn't make much sense if you ask me
What happened to the plans we made when we were young
Now they're just memories
Memories solely faded
What happened to all the plans we made
Was it all in vain when we were twenty something
How are we supposed to know
We're just twenty something years old
We could have taken it nice and slow
But I was always in a rush and you were on the go
We were a team, we were a tandem
Baby, we were really something
Maybe we're too young for the part
Don't you find yourself asking these questions
Like giving it another chance and
Maybe we're just better apart
I don't even wanna know why we became just a bunch of photographs
Doesn't make much sense if you ask me
What happened to the plans we made when we were young
Now they're just memories
Memories solely faded
What happened to all the plans we made
Was it all in vain when we were twenty something
I don't even wanna know why we became just a bunch of photographs
Doesn't make much sense if you ask me
What happened to the plans we made when we were young
Now they're just memories
Memories solely faded
What happened to all the plans we made
Was it all in vain when we were twenty something
What happened to all the plans we made
When we were twenty something
