Song Name: Space Cadet (feat. Gunna)
Yeah, ooh
Metro on these
Boominati wave, uh
(We've done it with robotic arm on the space shuttle)
(We've done it with direct launch of modules)
Prepare for light speed
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion in my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
Check came from my fans, life is fantastic (Fantastic)
I was broke as hell, sleepin' on the mattress (On the mattress)
I felt like it's Hell, wasn't nobody happy
Hot shells droppin' out the semi-automatic (Hot shells)
Ran it up, bought a condo, got a new addy (Ran it up)
Got the VVs with a Vlone jean jacket (VVs)
They can't see me even if you had 3D glasses (3D glasses)
Bad bitch in the bikini she from Calabasas (Calabasas)
Got a pocket full of bleu cheese and some green relish
I'm a psycho for these hundreds, got a cash fetish (Cash fetish)
I've been studyin' these hundreds, I'm a mathematic
And this love make me wanna buy my dad a Caddy
'Cause the love got me geeked up, I don't need an Addy
Dracos let these niggas know we war-ready ('Cos)
Expensive clothes on my bitches, we ain't ball-cappin'
Alien, feel like I'm livin' on my own planet
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion in my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
Chanel shoes overseas, they was patent leather
Shop in Tokyo, Japan, they the best ever
Blueberry t-shirt, sleeve on leather
Hard-top turn the vert, ride in any weather
You ain't gotta bend down
This ain't the propeller
Me and Wheezy spent a dime coppin' Gucci sweaters
Steady drippin', nigga drownin' I cannot help him
It's the Boominati, guys, we are not the devil (Boominati)
Got Columbia and ties out in Mexico (Mexico)
Wash the Benz a hundred times still smell dope (Smell dope)
Got some pants from Philipp Plein feel like velcro
A bitch fine and love shoppin' at Rodeo (Yeah)
I be iffy, don't want cop if it's a day old
Ain't stingy, my bro Gunna get a payroll
I just want the pretty women and the pesos
I can only hear the engine in this Lambo
Bought a spaceship now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion in my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion in my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
Oh, oh
(New coupe, I'm a space cadet, yeah)
Oh, oh
(Metro bought me two Pateks, ooh)
Oh, oh
(Is it drippin'? Got a nigga wet, hmm)
Oh, oh
(You on the Boominati wave)
