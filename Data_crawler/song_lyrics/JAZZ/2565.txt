Song Name: Baby, I Don't Cry Over You
Had my lunch all alone
Waited for you to phone
Said you'd call me at two
So 'bout twenty of three
I had cocktails with Lee
Baby, I don't cry over you
Stood me up in the rain
Tried to hurt me again
Bet you thought I'd be blue
I went out to a show
With a swell guy named Joe
Baby, I don't cry over you
These foolish games you keep playing
Might work with somebody else
Well, I could have told you right from the start
No man is man enough to break my heart
If you don't come tonight
Think you'll give me a fright
Tell you what I will do
I'll put on my best gown
And go painting this town
Baby, I don't cry over you
These foolish games you keep playing
Might work with somebody else
Well I could have told you right from the start
No man is man enough to break my heart
If you don't come tonight
Think you'll give me a fright
Tell you what I will do
I'll put on my best gown
And go painting this town
Baby, I don't cry over you
Listen, Jack, your sweet Jill
Will be out with some Bill
Baby, I don't cry over you
