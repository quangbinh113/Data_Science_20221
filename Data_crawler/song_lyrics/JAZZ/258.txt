Song Name: Master the Blaster (From "Master")
Got the man with the plan right here
Bringing swag with the man right here
Livin' up and sippin' on beer
Yeah, clap for me man right here
Got the man with the plan right here
Bringing swag with the man right here
Livin' up and sippin' on beer
Yeah, clap for me man right here
Hey, no matter what they say
Master the blaster
Hey, no matter what they do
Mr. master the blaster
Riddim!
Hey, no matter what they say
Master the blaster (master the blaster)
Hey, no matter what they do
Mr. master the blaster
Got the man with the plan right here
Bringing swag with the man right here (live it)
Livin' up and sippin' on beer
Yeah, clap for me man right here
Got the man with the plan right here
Bringing swag with the man right here (live it)
Livin' up and sippin' on beer
Yeah, clap for me man right here
Sound the alarm!
Yeah fuel up 'em on, JD setting fire to the screen
Big ups your mind, big ups to all your lovely people
