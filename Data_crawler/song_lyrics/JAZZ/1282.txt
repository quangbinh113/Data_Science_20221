Song Name: Watermelon Sugar
Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries
And that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar
Watermelon sugar, watermelon sugar high
(Watermelon sugar) I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
