Song Name: If I Were A Bell
Ask me how do I feel now that we're cozy and clinging
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light or if I were a banner I'd wave
Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a gate I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs
Well and if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding
Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm leaning
Well sir, all I can say if I were a bridge I'd be burning
Yes, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack or if I were a goose I'd be cooked
Ask me how do I feel, now that we're finally caressing
Pal, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Yes or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding
Ask me how do I feel, now that we're cozy and clinging
Well, sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight
