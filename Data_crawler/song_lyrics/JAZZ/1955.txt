Song Name: Pennies From Heaven (with Michael Bubl√©)
Every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from Heaven
And don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from Heaven?
You'll find your fortunes falling
All over the town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
And trade them for a package of
Sunshine and some flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from Heaven
For you (for you) and me
Every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from Heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from Heaven?
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You gotta have showers
Every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from Heaven
Don't you know that each cloud contains
Pennies from Heaven?
You'll find your fortunes falling
All over the town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You gotta have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from Heaven
For you and me
Pennies from heaven
For you and me
(For you and for me)
