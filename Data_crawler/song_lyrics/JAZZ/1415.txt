Song Name: The Nearness Of You - Remastered
It's not the pale moon that excites me,
That thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you
Isn't your sweet conversation
That brings me this sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you.
When I'm in your arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wondrous dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night,
The nearness of you.
