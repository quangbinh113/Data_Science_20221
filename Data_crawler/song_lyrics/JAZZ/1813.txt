Song Name: A Love That Will Last
I want a little something more
Don't want the middle or the one before
I don't desire a complicated past
I want a love that will last
Say that you love me
Say I'm the one
Don't kiss and hug me and then try to run
I don't do drama
My tears don't fall fast
I want a love that will last
I don't want just a memory
Give me forever
Don't even think about saying goodbye
'Cause I just want one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till I die
So call me romantic
Oh I guess that must be so
There's something more that you oughta know
I'll never leave you
So don't even ask
I want a love that will last
Forever
I want a love that will last
I don't just want a memory
Give me forever
Don't even think about saying goodbye
'Cause I just want one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till I die
So there's just a little more that I need
I wanna share all the air that you breathe
I'm not the kind of girl to complicate the past
I want a love that will last
Forever
I want a love the love that last
Always
I just want a love that will last
Want a love that will last
