Song Name: Moods
Trying just hard to get that feeling back in my mind
If I don't succeed in I won't survive
This day that is grey and cold, not only outside
So I try to lean back and relax
And my fantasy gets awake...
Feelin' the sand soft running through my toes
Tiny drops of the ocean land on my face
The sun tickles in my nose and the wind stripes my skin
The only coldness I feel comes from the drink in my right hand
Can't think of anything that brings me down
If I don't succeed in I won't survive
I just want to stay here till the sun says goodbye
I don't think 'bout the night or take care
What will happen the next day...
Trying just hard to get that feeling back in my mind
If I don't succeed in I won't survive
This day that is grey and cold, not only outside
So I try to lean back and relax
And my fantasy gets awake...
