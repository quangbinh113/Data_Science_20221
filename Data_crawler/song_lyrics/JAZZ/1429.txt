Song Name: I Won't Dance
Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me
You'd be the idol of France with me
And yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically
While I wait here so ecstatically, you just look and say emphatically
Not this season, yes, that's the reason
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do, yes
You know what, you're lovely
So what, you're still lovely
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
Yes, when you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feelin' isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos
And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, monsieur, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do
You know what, you're handsome
And so what, you're handsome
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos
And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
Yes, I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I will not dance, madame, with you
Yes, my heart won't let my feet do things they should do
Yeah, you know what, you're kinda lovely
And so what, I'm lovely
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shores
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feelin' isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos, honey, oh, oh yes
And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
