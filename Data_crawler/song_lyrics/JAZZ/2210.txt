Song Name: You're Mine, You!
You're mine, you
You belong to me, you
I will never free you
You're here with me to stay
You're mine, you
You are mine completely
Love me strong or sweetly
I need you night and day
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We will be found together
Heart to heart, lips to lips
We're chained and bound together
I own you
I don't need to buy love
You're a slave to my love
In every way, you're mine
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We will be found together
Heart to heart, lips to lips
We're chained and bound together
I own you
I don't need to buy love
You're a slave to my love
In every way, you're mine
