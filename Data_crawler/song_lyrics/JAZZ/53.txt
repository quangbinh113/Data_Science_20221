Song Name: Lemonade
She's my sunshine in the rain
She's my Tylenol when I'm in pain yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
Like a tall glass of lemonade
When it's burning hot on summer days
She's exactly what I need
She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me, baby
And she helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
She's my smile when I'm feeling blue
She's my good night sleep when my day is through yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
(She's kinda like this)
Kinda like the feeling after your first kiss
Except that everyday she makes me feel like this
She's exactly what I need
She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what
You're more of what I need
And less of what I don't, baby
The ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
I need
She's exactly what I need
