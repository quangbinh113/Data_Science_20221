Song Name: We Used to Call It Love
Babe's gone away, just for a while
I'm sitting down here wondering why, oh, why
Babe's gone away, so far away
I'm sitting down wondering what to say
Babe's gone away just for a while
I'm sitting down here wondering why, oh, why
Babe's gone away, so far away
And I'm sitting down wondering what to say
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
Babe's gone away now from the shore
Here I am crying out for more
Baby's gone, yeah, heading north
Let me down feeling blue and cold
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
Love, love
De maio ochum pudisda tanto
Ausencia tchal um vazio tao grand
Sem rumo el anda txeu temp cretxeu
Bai xpi√° se liberdade longe dess mund, oh
Baby's gone away, gone through the night
Lying down, wondering why and how
Is there anything I could have done?
Is there anything I should have done before?
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
We used to call it love
Used to call it love
