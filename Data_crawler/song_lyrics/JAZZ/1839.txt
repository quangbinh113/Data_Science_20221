Song Name: Breaking up Is Hard to Do
Feat. Peter Cincotti
Peter Cincotti:
Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do
Renee Olstead:
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me and it felt so right
Think of all that we've been through (together)
Breaking Up Is Hard To Do
Together:
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Renee Olstead:
Now I know, I know that it's true
Together:
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
I wish that we were making up again
Renee Olstead:
We were making up again
Peter Cincotti:
I beg of you (I beg of you)
Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
Together:
Can't we give our love just one more try
Peter Cincotti:
Come on, let's start a new
Together:
'Cause breaking up is hard to do
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Peter Cincotti:
Now I know (I know)
I know that it's true
Together:
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
I wish that we were making up again
Renee Olstead:
Oh we were making up again.
Together:
I beg of You
Don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love
Just one more try
Come on, let's start a new
Cause Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking Up,
Is hard to do.
Hard to do.
