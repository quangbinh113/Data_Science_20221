Song Name: Wish You Were Here
Oh yeah
Oh
I watched you leaving
And never tried to get you to stay
Somehow I talked myself into believing that
It's just another game that we play
But the moment you're gone
The heartache begins
Like an ocean of sorrow
That I keep drowning in
Should I reach for the phone
Or wait for your call?
I don't care who was wrong
I won't go there at all
Oh, I wish you were here
It's times just like these
That I desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There's a world of love inside us to share
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wished we always
Find a way to cause each other such pain
There's no doubt we love so completely
That sometimes we go a little insane
And the thing that keeps us
From drifting apart
Is the fact that we are bound by
The soul and the heart
Every power on earth
Every storm we'll survive
Come hell or high water
Love won't be denied
Oh, I wish you were here
It's times just like these
That I desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There's a world of love inside us to share
I wish you were here
Far too many nights, too many fights
When we should be making up
Let's get past the pride
And reach down inside for love, for love, for love
I wish you were here
It's times just like these
That I desperately need you
I wish you were here
There's a world of love inside us to share
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
It's times just like these
I need, and I need you too
I wish you were here
There's a world of love inside us to share
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Oh, I wish you were here
