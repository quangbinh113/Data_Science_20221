Song Name: If I should lose you
If I should lose you, the stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you, the leaves would wither and die
The birds in May time would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around hating the sound of rain
With you beside me, no wind in winter would blow
With you beside me, a rose would bloom in the snow
I gave you my love but I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain if I lost you
