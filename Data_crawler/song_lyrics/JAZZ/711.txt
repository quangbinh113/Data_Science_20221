Song Name: Too Bad
Might be lying next to her
Lying to yourself
Deep down you know
You wanna be with somebody else
But you missed your chance, baby
Never gave a shot
Don't really hope you're happy
Cause you made me hurt a lot
Bet she can't kiss like me, though
Yeah, she can't fuck like me, no
What I got she can never be, no
Ain't that too bad?
Bet she can't kiss like me, tho
Yeah, she can't fuck like me no
What I got she can never be, no
Ain't that too bad?
Bad baby
Bad baby
Close your eyes and
You see me
You see me
Ain't that all too
Bad baby
Bad baby
Too bad baby
Too bad baby
But I don't blame her
I blame the situation
I guess she's under your spell
Game of manipulation
I know you (the real you)
Hiding under all these faces
You can pretend all you want
But I know that she's just a phase, yeah
Cause you know she can't kiss like me, though
Yeah, she can't fuck like me no
What I got she can never be, no
Ain't that too bad?
Bet she can't kiss like me tho
Yeah, she can't fuck like me, no
What I got she could never be, no
Ain't that too bad?
Bad baby
Bad baby
Close your eyes and
You see me
You see me
Ain't that all too
Bad baby
Bad baby
Too bad baby
Too bad baby
Bet she can't kiss
Bet she can't fuck
Bet she can't kiss like me, no
Bet she can't fuck like me, tho
Bet she can't kiss
Bet she can't fuck
Bet she can't kiss like me, no
Bet she can't fuck like me, though
Bad baby
Bad baby
Close your eyes and
You see me
You see me
Ain't that all too
Bad baby
Bad baby
Too bad baby
Too bad baby
