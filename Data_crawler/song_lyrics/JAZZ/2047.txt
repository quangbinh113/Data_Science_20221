Song Name: Hey There
Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you,
You used to be too wise.
Hey there
You on that high flying cloud
Tho' she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you.
Better forget her,
Her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string,
Break it and she won't care.
Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other.
Better forget her,
Her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string,
Break it and she won't care.
Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other.
