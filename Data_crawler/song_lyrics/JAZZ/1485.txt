Song Name: Bags' Groove
Check, check, check it out ya'll
Ooh yeah, come on ya'll
I want you to, I want you to
I want you to turn on the groove
You guys are unbelievable
The feeling is fine you throw down the line
The beat, the lyrics are too combined
Tonight tonight is meant to be wild
Doing it to a level that feels alright
'Cause we're the ones yes the dance floor fillers
Don't like crime, don't like killers
Come on over what you trying to fool
Nothing alright then throw down the groove
Throw the groove down
Spinning round and round
We race them, we gotta pump
We can't get loose
Throw the groove down
Spinning round and round
We turn it up, not gonna stop
Just throw down the groove
You know that the best things in life are free
But if you don't make sure that you get a receipt
Like my man, Bob Marley said, 'Stand Up For Right'
Don't give up the fight if you help me all might
I think there's no time for no child's play
In the playground or perhaps another day
'Cause I in effect 'cause I coming in smooth
In other words throw down the groove
Throw the groove the down
Spinning round and round
We race them, we gotta pump
We can't get loose
Throw the groove down
Spinning round and round
We turn it up, not gonna stop
Just throw down the groove
Spinning round and round
Come on ya'll
Hoo, throw the groove down
Come on ya'll
Come, come, come on ya'll
Throw the groove down
Throw the groove down
Throw the groove down
Throw the groove down
