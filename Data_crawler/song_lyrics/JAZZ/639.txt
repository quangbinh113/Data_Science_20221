Song Name: Your Heart Is As Black As Night
Your eyes maybe whole
But the story I'm told
Is your heart is as black as night
Your lips maybe sweet
Such that I can't compete
But your heart is as black as night
I don't know why it came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind
'Cause your hands maybe strong
But the feelings are all wrong
Your heart is as black as night
I don't know why it came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind
'Cause your hands maybe strong
But the feelings are all wrong
Your heart is as black
Your heart is as black
Oh, your heart is as black as night
