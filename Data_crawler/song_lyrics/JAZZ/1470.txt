Song Name: Get Down Saturday Night
(Get down, it's Saturday night)
(Saturday night)
(Saturday night)
Saturday morning
Friday's enemy
Housework is calling me
But where to begin?
Kids are out of school
Trying to find a friend
Everybody's busy
Can't wait for the night to begin
You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Friday's at an end
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I'm thinking
I'm gonna have myself (Saturday night)
Some fun, fun, fun (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) make love until the morning come
(Get down, it's Saturday night)
Gonna have myself (Saturday night)
Some fun, fun, fun (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) make love until the morning come
I like to party
Everybody does
You can wait for the weekend at dawn
To see what you get into
But you got to get down, down, down, down, down, down
Even if you stay at home
Make love and listen to some music
You got to let yourself go, go, go, go, go
You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Friday's at an end
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I'm thinking
I'm gonna have myself (Saturday night)
Some fun, fun, fun (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) make love until the morning come
(Get down, it's Saturday night)
I'm gonna have myself (Saturday night)
Some fun, fun, fun (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) make love until the morning come
In New York, in Detroit, even in L.A.
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I can't wait for Saturday to begin (no, no, no, no, no, no)
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Friday's at an end, man
I can't wait for Saturday to begin (oh, oh)
My babe (Saturday night)
(Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) woah, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
(Get down, it's Saturday night)
I'm gonna have myself (Saturday night)
Some fun, fun, fun (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) make love until the morning come
(Get down, it's Saturday night) some like to party (Saturday night)
Some like to dance (Saturday night, it's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) some like to make romance
