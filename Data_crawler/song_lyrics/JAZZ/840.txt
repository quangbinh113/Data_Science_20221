Song Name: Green & Gold
Six years old
Staring at my nose in the mirror
Trying to get my toes in the mirror
Thinking 'Who's that girl?'
And 'Does the mirror world go on forever?'
Carve me a road
Sharpening the knives in the attic
Trying to watch cartoons through the static
Thinking where am I gonna be
If I'm ever twenty three?
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sun rise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from
Found an old friend
Meeting my guitar in the city
Feeling like a star in the city
And suddenly it seems that I'm where I'm supposed to be, oh
And now I'm fully grown
And I'm seeing everything clearer
Just sweep away the dust from the mirror
We're walking hand in hand in the warm white sands
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sun rise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Ancient stone
Green and gold
Ancient stone
Green and gold
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sun rise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sun rise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from
