Song Name: Casual
We can take the long way
We'll get there even if it takes all night
We'll talk until the morning
Don't tell me that you're fine if you're not fine
And if it's only pleasure that you're seeking
Then I'll be penciling you in for the weekend
Forget about the white noise
It's chocolate and pajamas 'til the whole world fades
Just right
Yes please
We can sink into the sofa for the whole week
Just right
Easy
We could just break down, break down these walls
Over some take out
Don't you worry 'bout nothing at all
I can get to know you
We can take it slow
Savor every moment
Keep it on the low
Baby just let go
And we can keep this whole thing casual
Well take it back to the beginning when we first met
I find if funny how you hit me with the silence
Said lady what's the deal
'Cause I'm diggin' your sex appeal
But now when I'm with you I feel
Just right
Yes please
Girl we could kick it at the crib for like the whole week
Just right
At ease
I'll give you what you need
We could just break down, break down these walls
Over some take out
Don't you worry 'bout nothing at all
I can get to know you
We can take it slow
Savor every moment
Keep it on the low
Baby just let go
And we can keep this whole thing casual
Relaxation 'til we take it to the limit
Meditation 'til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights
And new beginnings
If you love me, won't you say so
Girl, won't you say so
Relaxation 'til we take it to the limit
Meditation 'til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights
And new beginnings
Baby we can keep it casual
Relaxation 'til we take it to the limit
Meditation 'til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights
My head is spinning
If you love me, won't you say so
Relaxation 'til we take it to the limit
Meditation 'til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights
And new beginnings
We can keep it casual
