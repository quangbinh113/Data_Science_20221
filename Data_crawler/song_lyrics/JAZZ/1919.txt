Song Name: The Good Life
Oh, the good life
Full of fun, seems to be the ideal
Mmm, the good life
Lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So please, be honest
With yourself
Don't try to fake romance
It's the good life
To be free, and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches
When you learn you must face them alone
Please remember
I still want you
And in case, you wonder why
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life, goodbye
