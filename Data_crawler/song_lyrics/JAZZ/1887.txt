Song Name: Letâ€™s Fall In Love
I have a feeling, it's a feeling
I'm concealing, don't know why
It's just a mental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you, I'm so strong for you
Why go on stalling, I am falling
My love is calling, why be shy?
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it
Still we can try
To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it
While we are young
Let's fall in love
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it
While we are young
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
Let's fall
Let's fall in love
