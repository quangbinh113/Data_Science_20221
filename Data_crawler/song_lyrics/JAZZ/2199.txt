Song Name: Free Your Mind
Friend of mine cornered in on time
Mix a bit with mine
You will find he could take you higher fool upon a wire time to time
Need a helping hand you're gonna call the man in
The rain you can walk the sunshine you can chooose to
*Feel alright use your time view's no clear when you're here it's
Alright to find the real thing it's alright to find the real thing
Now's the time to for a real thing it's alright to find the real
Thing find you way get yourself together living day to
Day you can't hide please the sensation you don't have to
*Repeat it's alright to find the real thing it's alright to
Find the real thing find the real thing find the real thing
) It's alright to find the real thing it's alright to find the real
Thing now's the time for a real thing it's alright to find the
Real thing it's alright to find the real thing it's alright...
