Song Name: Somebody To Love
When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I say your eyes may look like his
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I say your eyes may look like his
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you want somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Yeah but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Baby, are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I say your eyes may look like his
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I say your eyes may look like his
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you want somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Oh-ohh
