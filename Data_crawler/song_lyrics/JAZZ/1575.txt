Song Name: Almost Like Being in Love
What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
And there's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why, it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
Oh, it's almost like being in love
Oh, what a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
And there's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why, it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
Oh, and from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear that I was falling
I could swear that I was falling
Oh, it's almost like being in love

Oh, what a day that this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
It's almost like being in love
And there's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why, it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
Oh, and from the way that I feel
When that bell does peal
I wish that I was falling
I swear that I was falling
It's almost like being in love!
See I just wanna be
I live to be
I wanna be
I wanna be
In love
Where all the birds are singing
And all the bells are ringing
Just for me
So I can be in
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
In love, love, love, love, love
I wanna be in love
Oh, yeah
I wanna be in love
I want to be in love
Don't you want to come with me?
