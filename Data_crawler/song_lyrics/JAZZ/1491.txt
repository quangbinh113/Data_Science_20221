Song Name: You Are The Universe
You're the future
And you've come for what is yours
The hidden treasure
Locked behind the hidden doors
And the promise
Of a day that's shining new
Only a dreamer
Could afford this point of view
But you're a driver
Not a passenger in life
And if you're ready
You won't have to try 'cause
You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do
You're a winner
So do what you came here for
The secret weapon
Isn't secret anymore
You're a driver
Never passenger in life
And when you're ready
You won't have to try 'cause
You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do
You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't be
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, and I believe in me
Yes I do
Believe in you, I do
Yeah, I do
You're a driver
Not a passenger in life
And when you're ready
You won't have to try 'cause
You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do
You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't be
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, and I believe in me
You are the universe (you)
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you
You are the universe (believe you)
And there ain't nothin' you can't be (I do)
If you conceive it, you can achieve it (if you, if you, if you)
That's why, I believe in you, I believe in me
You are the universe (universe, baby)
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
(Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' you can't do, no-no)
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you
You are the universe (yeah, you)
And there ain't nothin' you can't be
(Ain't nothin' you can't be now, you're a star)
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why-
