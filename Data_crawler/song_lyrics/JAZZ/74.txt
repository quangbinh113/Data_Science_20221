Song Name: over and over
Put my hands around your shoulders
That's the way that I hold ya
I could lay with you forever
Baby, uh
I'm fallin' everyday
Something came over me
I give you everything
Over and Over a
I'm fallin' everyday
Something came over me
I give you everything
Over and Over a
Gain
Over again
Over and over a
(A)gain
Over again
Over and over a
Put your hoodie over my head
Stay and talk to me in my bed
Think we finally found the real thing
Baby, Baby
(Ah)
I'm fallin' everyday
Something came over me
I give you everything
Over and Over a
I'm fallin' everyday
Something came over me
I give you everything
Over and Over a
(Over)
Gain
Over again
Over and over a
(A)gain
Over again
Over and over a
Over and over again
Again
Over and over a
