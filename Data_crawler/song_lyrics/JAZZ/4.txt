Song Name: Starting To
I've never felt like this
Was stuck inside my own atmosphere
Afraid of the thoughts that would
Cycle through my mind, about you
Yeah, I've never been like this
Stuck on little things you do
Stuck on stupid things I've done
I don't know which way to go from here
Guess we still gotta take it slow
Cuz darling I don't know
They say that line a lot in songs
But I like the way it sounds
I know we can't go wrong
Move in a little slower
I hope I don't lose my mind
Thinkin' too hard all the time
I'm tryin' to stop
You tell me that it's okay all the time
When am I on your mind
I hope that I'm on your mind
Sometimes I can't sleep cuz
I get caught up thinkin' 'bout this
Guess we still gotta take it slow
Cuz darling I don't know
They say that line a lot in songs
But I like the way it sounds
Cuz I know we can't go wrong
Move in a lot
We gotta take it slow
Cuz darling I don't know
It gets hard for me not to rush
And I know the way that sounds
I'm tryin' not to be rash
About things
And oh, I don't know if I've learned yet
What it means to love
Someone in this way
But I think I might be starting to
Guess we
Guess we still gotta take it slow
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ooh-ooh, ooh
