Song Name: Just A Little Lovin'
Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
Beats a cup of coffee
For starting out the day
Just a little lovin'
When the world is yawnin'
Makes you wake up feelin'
Good things are coming your way
This old world wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had
Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
A little extra somethin'
To kind of see them through
Nothin' turns the day on
Really gets it dawnin'
Like a little bit of lovin'
From some lovin' someone like you
This old world wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had
Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
Little extra somethin'
Early in the mornin'
Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
When the world is yawnin'
Early in the mornin'
