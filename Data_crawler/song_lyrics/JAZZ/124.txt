Song Name: I Ain't Perfect
There you are, beautiful, quietly
Sleepin' on the bed we made right next to me
Feels like a dream
Only a dream
Here we are holding on, dangerously
Dancin' on the edge of the infinity
Feels like a dream
Only a dream
Writing all these memories
Singing all these melodies
Waiting here for centuries
I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
Perfect for you
Perfect for you
Here I am, beautiful, as you see
Standing on the pedestal you made for me
Feels like a dream
Only a dream
Waltzin' through our symphonies
In our little galaxy
Waiting for our destiny

I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
Perfect for you
Perfect for you
There you are, beautiful, quietly
Sleepin' on the bed we made right next to me
Feels like a dream
Only a dream

I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
Perfect for you
Perfect for you
I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
Perfect for you
Perfect for you
There you are, beautiful, quietly
