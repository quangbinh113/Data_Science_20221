Song Name: Trampoline (with ZAYN)
Dreams, dreams, dreams
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up (as I'm lookin' up)
Suddenly, the sky erupts (sky erupts)
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice (my body turns to ice)
Crushing weight of paradise (paradise)
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love? (In love)
When I dream of dying (dying)
I never feel so loved (so loved)
Wait, if I'm on fire (so loved)
How am I so deep in love? (So loved)
When I dream of dying (so loved)
I never feel so loved
(I never feel so loved) so loved
So loved
La, la-la, la-la
I've been havin' dreams
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
Jumpin' on a trampoline
La, la-la, la-la
Flippin' in the air
La, la-la, la-la, la
I never land, just float there
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying (dying)
I never feel so loved (so loved)
Wait, if I'm on fire (so loved)
How am I so deep in love? (So loved)
When I dream of dying (so loved)
I never feel so loved (so loved)
