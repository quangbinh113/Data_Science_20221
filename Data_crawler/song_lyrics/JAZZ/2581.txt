Song Name: Time on My Hands
Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view
Then if you fall, once and for all
I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare with someone you care
For one love affair for two
And so with time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you
Moments to spare with someone you care
For one love affair for two
And so with time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you
