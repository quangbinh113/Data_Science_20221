Song Name: Do I Move You?
Do I move you
Are you willin'?

Do I groove you
Is it thrillin'?
Do I soothe you?
Tell the truth now
Do I move you?
Are you loose now?
The answer better be yes, yes
That pleases me
Are you ready
For this action?

Does it give you
Satisfaction?
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'?
If you are
Then let's start swayin'
The answer better be yes, yes
That pleases me
When I touch you
Do you quiver

From your head
Down to your liver?
If you like it
Let me know it
Don't be psychic
Or you'll blow it
The answer better be yes, yes
Great God almighty, that pleases me
