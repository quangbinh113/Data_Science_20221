Song Name: It's Crazy
You must be crazy, when you give your heart away
You must be crazy, that's what all the people say
And I guess that it's true, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you
Your world gets hazy, don't know if it's night or day
You must be crazy, that's what all the people say
And I guess that it's true, 'cause I'm so crazy 'bout you
And you turned my world around
It's really quite fright'ning, like thunder and lightning
All you did was look at me,
And then you threw the book at me
It's crazy, if you're smart you'll just give in
You know it's crazy, even when you lose you win
And I guess that it's true, 'cause I'm so crazy 'bout you
