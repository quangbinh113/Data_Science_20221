Song Name: Zombie
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken

And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head? In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du
Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head they're still fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are dying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head? In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra
