Song Name: Just A Dream
Last I lost another
Alone and lonely lover
I'm wondering in who's arms you will be
You'll be here one day
I'll hope and pray
You've got your village waiting
A rueful when it's raining
I'm naming it before you're here
Dear Lord, above
Please send true love
I'll patiently just let it be
I'll wait and see what comes to me
A melody that completes me
A wildest birth set reprieve
And beautifully our love will be
I'll manifest our destiny and one day
You'll be more than just a dream
And while the world is burning
It pales against my awnings
I'm learning life's journey one's unknown
I'll hope and pray
You'll be here one day
It seems I have seen its best
And projecting blind fate's lesson
Though guessing leaves you feeling low
Dear Lord, above
Please send true love
I'll patiently just let it be
I'll wait and see if there's a she
Who completes me, my melody
My world batter fly little free, fly beautifully
And beautifully our love will be
I'll manifest our destiny and one day
You'll be more than just a dream
