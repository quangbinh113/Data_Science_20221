Song Name: Why Why Why
When sunshine, doesn't wake me again
When moonlight, doesn't lull me to sleep
Oh why why why why why why, I'm lost in my mind
Everytime I call her, she doesn't know
She's asleep faraway, I can't find her
I try, try to be strong
I can't do, I can't do
When sunshine, doesn't wake me again
When moonlight, doesn't lull me to sleep
Oh why why why why why why, I'm lost in my mind
Everytime I call her, she doesn't know
She's asleep faraway, I can't find her
I try, try to be strong
I can't do, I can't do
Oh why why why why why why, I'm lost in my mind
