Song Name: Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what's spring is like
On a Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and I adore
In other words
Please, be true
In other words
I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please, be true
In other words
In other words
I love you
