Song Name: Alone Together
Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, we're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together
Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night, we're not in vain
For we're together, and what is there to fear together
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can wеather the great unknown
If wе're alone together
We can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together
Alone together
Alone together
Alone together
