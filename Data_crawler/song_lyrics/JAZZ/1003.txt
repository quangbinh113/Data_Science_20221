Song Name: I Get Lifted
Sittin' here together, baby we're all alone
Now I can tell ya, girl, you turn me on
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
Bring out the lovin', lovin' desire, baby
You got the match, oh that lights the fire
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
Mama-mama, mama-mama (woo!)
Mama-mama, mama-mama
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
Oh, mama-mama, mama-mama (woo!)
Oh, oh, mama-mama, mama-mama (woo, hot!)
Uh, mama-mama, mama-mama
I get lifted, I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted, I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted, I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted, I get lifted...
