Song Name: Let the Good Times Roll (with B.B. King)
Hey, everybody, let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done
So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you wanna have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together and let the good times roll
Hey, Mr. Landlord, lock all the doors
When the police come around
Tell 'em the joint is closed
And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Hey y'all, tell everybody, B.B's in town
I got a dollar and a quarter, I'm just rarin' to clown
And don't let nobody play him cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep
So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
No matter whether, it's rainy weather
Birds of a feather got to stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out there and get together
And let the good times roll
No, I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
