Song Name: I've Got A Crush On You
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All day and night time give me sign
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion
Could you, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush my baby on you
How glad the million ralish from millionairs to carish
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion
Could you, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush?
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you
