Song Name: Your Mind Is on Vacation
You sittin here and yakkin right in my face
I guess I'm gonna have to put you in your place
You know if silence was golden
You couldn't raise a dime
Because your mind is on vacation and your mouth is workin' overtime
You quotin' figures and droppin' names
You tellin' stories about the dames
You're overlaughin' when things ain't funny
You tryin' to sound like big money
You know if talk was criminal
You'd lead a life of crime
Because your mind is on vacation and your mouth is workin overtime
You know that life is short
Talk is cheap
Don't be makin' promises that you can't keep
You don't like this little song I'm singin'
Just grin and bear it
All I can say is if the shoe fits wear it
If you must keep talkin
Please try to make it rhyme
Because your mind is on vacation and your mouth is workin' overtime
