Song Name: Do Like That
IFeeling it in my soul yeh yeh yeh
Oh no no eh eh
Why you gon do like that
Why you gon keep that thing from me
Why you gon do like that
Why you gon act like you don't know me
Baby don't do like that
Girl come feed me don't be stingy
Why you gon do like that
No baby don't do like that
Want you to roll, see I like the way you jo
And you sabi do the dance, and you dey ____
Baby you know say you carry no be small
Shebi torimi lo se ge gele skonkolo
Girl I like the way you, like the way you
I like the way you dance for me, I like the way you dance
I like the way you dance like say you want to greet your mummy
You bend like say you want to pack your money
Just bend like say you want to kneel for daddy
Just bend like say you no send anybody
Why you gon do like that
Why you gon keep that thing from me
Why you gon do like that
Why you gon act like you don't know me
Baby don't do like that
Baby don't tell me you don't know that you're beautiful
Oh baby don't do like that
I know you feel it in the bone inside your body
I know you need someone to hold somebody like me
I know you want a piece of me (of me)
You want to say my name (my name)
So tell me why you don't wanna spit it out
(I know you feel it in the bone inside your body
So tell me why you don't wanna spit it out)
Baby don't do like that
Why you gon keep that thing from me
Why you gon do like that
Why you gon act like you don't know me
Baby don't do like that
Baby don't tell me you don't know you're beautiful
Don't do like that
My love be say say
I love you sotey
Baby don't do
So le bere bayi bayi
So le bere bayi bayi
Mo ni ko bere bayi bayi
Ehn oya bere bayi
Sole bere bayi
