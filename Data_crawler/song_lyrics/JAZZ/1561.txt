Song Name: Soul Eyes
A soul
I'm told
Can be both hot and cold
So how is one to know
Which way to go
A soul is mirrored
In the eyes
But how is one to know
When the whole world
Is full of such lies
So darling
Watch those eyes
And even more those lies
And then you will see them smile
For a long, long while
Then you'll know that the one
Who will always
Always be true
That's how I
That is how I found, found you
Found you
