Song Name: In the Morning
I'm looking in your eyes
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing left to say
I've been trying hard but the night is through
I'm lying in this bed
Don't wanna go away
I see you in the dark, but you're sleeping already
Hold your pillow tight
'Cause I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while when you've broken your chains
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while when you've broken your chains
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
I'm looking in your eyes
I wanted us to last, oh
Do you recall the song that I wrote, did you hear it?
I know you've heard them all
I know I've been a liar
But would you ever change?
Have you ever thought about knowing your heart to keep us going on?
I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while when you've broken your chains
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while when you've broken your chains
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
In the morning
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
And I'll be gone for a while
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while when you've broken your chains
Yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Oh, yes, I'll be gone in the morning
Clap your hands
And I'll be gone for a while (clap your hands)
Yes I'll be gone (clap your hands) in the morning
