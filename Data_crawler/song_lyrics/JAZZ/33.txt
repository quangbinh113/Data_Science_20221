Song Name: The First Thing You See
The sun slowly rises, you'll open your eyes
I'll be the first thing you see
Through rain and cold snow, when all others go
You'll always be waking by me
I'll be the first thing you see
Holding you tight as day turns to night
I'll be the first thing you see
Falling asleep as our lips softly meet
You'll always be sleeping by me
I'll be the first thing you see
As I kiss your tired shoulder
While we spill our minds again
Over our future growing older
Not if, but when?
Our cinema minds have pictures inside
In colours that we've never seen
Geometry in bold, what a thing to behold
We'll wake from impossible dreams
I'll be the first thing you see
As I kiss your tired shoulder
While we spill our minds again
Over our future growing older
Not if, but when?
As I kiss your tired shoulder
While we spill our minds again
Over our future growing older
Not if...
