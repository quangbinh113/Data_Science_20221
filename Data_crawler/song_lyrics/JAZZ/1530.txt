Song Name: The Girl From Ipanema
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa
When she walks she's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa
Oh, but I watch her so sadly

How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes
I go di-di-do-di
The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema
Yea I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see.
She ain't looking at me.
