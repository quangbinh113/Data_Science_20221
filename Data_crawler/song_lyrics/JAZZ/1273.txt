Song Name: Night & Day
If I can't have your love
I don't want nothing at all
If I can't have your love
I'll keep my heart behind the wall
I don't want to see the sun
Don't want nothing from no one
And night and day don't mean a thing to me
If I can't have your love
I don't want nobody else
If I can't have your love
I'll keep my sorrow to myself
Can't do no go with my time
Got no rhythm got no rhyme
And night and day don't mean a thing to me
Come back and revive my sense
Set fire to my skin
Give me a reason to feel defenceless
Give me a reason to start again
If I can't have your love
I don't want to play the game
If I can't have your love
It would be a lie to love again
I don't have a life to live
If you've got no love to give
And night and day don't mean a thing to me
