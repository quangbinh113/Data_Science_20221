Song Name: I Remember You - Remastered 2004
"I Remember You
You're the one who made my dreams
Come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said
I love you too
Didn't you know
And I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I Remember You!
Trumpet Solo
Piano Solo
I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember you!
If they should ask
I'll gladly tell them
I remember you!"
