Song Name: Moon River
Moon river wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Old dream maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
Moon river wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Old dream maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We'll be after that same rainbow's end
Just waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
