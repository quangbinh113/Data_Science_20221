Song Name: Infinity - Dubdogz & Bhaskar Edit
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity (If you wanna-)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
You know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Don't know when it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody call me Mr. Infinity
(If you wanna-)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
(You know, you know, you know, you-)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
(Oh, you know, you know, you know)
You know, know, know, know...
You know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Don't know when it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
Rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody call me Mr. Infinity
(If you wanna-)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
(If you wanna be)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you-
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
