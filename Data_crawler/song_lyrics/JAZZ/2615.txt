Song Name: I Shall Be Released
They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls
I see my light come shining
From the west out to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
Man who says he's not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he's not to blame
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
