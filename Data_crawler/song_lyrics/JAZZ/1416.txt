Song Name: Love For Sale - 1959 Version
Love for sale,
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled,
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love,
Every kind of love but true love
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares,
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Da da da,
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled,
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who, who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love,
Every kind of love but true love
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares,
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
