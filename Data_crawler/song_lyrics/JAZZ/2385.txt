Song Name: Words Can't Describe
Words can't describe the way
That I feel for you.
Words can't describe the dreams
That you've made come true.
The wonderful things
That we planned together
Have all come true
Because we planned together
Through all kinds of weather.
I know that this love of ours
Will forever be
For words can't describe the way
That you're thrilling me.
I promise you that I will be
Forever yours eternally
For words can't describe how much
You mean to me.
The wonderful things
That we planned together
Have all come true
Because we planned together
Through all kinds of weather.
I know that this love of ours
Will forever be,
For words can't describe the way
That you're thrilling me.
I promise you that I will be
Forever yours eternally
For words can't describe how much you mean to me.
Words can't describe how much
You mean to me.
