Song Name: Time After Time
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through
Lord I only know
What I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky, so lucky to be loving
You
