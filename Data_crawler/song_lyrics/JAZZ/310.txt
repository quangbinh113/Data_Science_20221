Song Name: all my friends are fake
I've been keeping things inside
Taking up space 'til I got someone
I could open my mind up to
I guess it worked pretty good 'til now
But shit's kinda getting serious
I think I'm running out of room
Everyone's got someone built custom
To give their darkness to
I wish I had someone, could trust them
But loyalty don't come for free
'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake
Sorry, if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by a cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off
Everyone's got people they see through
But I see through everyone
So if you want me to believe you and need you
Might take some time to recognize
'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake
Sorry, if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by a cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off
All my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake
Like all my friends are fake
