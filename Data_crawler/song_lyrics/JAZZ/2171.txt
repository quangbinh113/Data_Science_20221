Song Name: September In The Rain - Live At Mister Kelly's, Chicago/1957
The leaves of brown, came tumbling down,
Remember
That September, in the Rain.
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That september
In the rain.
Through every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain.
Though spring is here to me its still September
That September
In the rain.
