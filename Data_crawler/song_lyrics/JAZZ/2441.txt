Song Name: For Heaven's Sake
Once I might take for granted world
Love was no common place
But now I see an enchanted world
In your face
In your embrace
For heaven's sake
Let's fall in love
It's no mistake to call it love
An angel's holding hands with me
How heavenly a heaven can be
Here is romance for us to try
Here is the chance we can't deny
While heaven's giving us the break
Let's fall in love for heaven's sake
Don't say a word my darling
Don't break the spell like this
Please hold me tight
We're alone in the night
And heaven is here at a kiss
This pair of eyes can see the stars
So paradise can't be so far
Since heavens what we're dreaming of
For heaven's sake let's fall in love.
