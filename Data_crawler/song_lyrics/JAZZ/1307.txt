Song Name: Body
You make me feel like a child, it's true
You make it seem like it is something brand new
I've never met as agile as you
You have a way with doing the things you do, yeah
Girl, you're like nobody else
You're bringing down my defenses
I'm losing track of my senses
I'm the puppet you possess
Let me please you like you would
Let me thank you how I should
Let me love you 'til we taste the morning dew
Just let the rhythm drift on you, baby, ooh
The way you look is so right for me, ooh
I want to hold on to you tightly, ooh
And let my lips slip on your body, ooh
You're really one of a kind, aren't you?
You show me things I didn't know I was into
I've never craved anyone like you
For you, I'm ready to change my point of view, yeah
Girl, you're like nobody else, no
You really have no complex, no
You make it all so intense, yeah
You pull me 'til I'm obsessed
Let me please you like you would
Let me thank you how I should
Let me love you 'til we taste the morning dew
Just let the rhythm drift on you, baby, ooh
The way you look is so right for me, ooh
I want to hold on to you tightly, ooh
And let my lips slip on your body, ooh
Just let the rhythm drift on you, baby, ooh
The way you look is so right for me, ooh
I want to hold on to you tightly, ooh
And let my lips slip on your body, ooh
