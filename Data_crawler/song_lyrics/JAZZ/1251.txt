Song Name: Time
Time again
I heard you say you were my friend
Time again
Time again
The truth won't hurt if you pretend
Oh but all the good things they must end
Time time time
Time time time
Time again
I read the letters that you send
Time again
Time again
Every truth that you contend
Oh and all the madness you defend
Time time time
Time time time
Time again
Some wounds they never seem to mend
Time again
Time again
With every hand that you extend
Oh and all the pennies that you lend
Time time time
Time time time
Ouoh ouoh
Aaaaaaaoh
Aaaaaaaoh
Time Time Time
Ouououh
Time again
I heard you say you were my friend
Time again
Time again
The truth won't hurt if you pretend
Oh but all the good things they must end
Time time time
Time time time
Ouoh ouoh
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Time time time
Ouououh
Time Time Time
