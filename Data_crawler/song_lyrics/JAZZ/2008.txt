Song Name: I've Got a Woman
Well, I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Said I got a woman, way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her loving, just for me
Oh, she love me so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right
Never running in the streets
Leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there now in her home
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Said I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Oh, she is my baby, don't you understand
Yeah, I'm her loving man
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Don't you know she's alright
Don't you know she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
Whoa yeah, oh yeah
