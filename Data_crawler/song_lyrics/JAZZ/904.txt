Song Name: Let Me Go
No need to rewind, be kind
And let me go
What's on your mind?
We tried and lost control
No need to rewind, be kind
And let me go
What's on your mind?
We tried and lost control
I'm dated, so frustrated
Tryna work it out and I'm agitated
Know you hate it, but we, we really need to talk about
