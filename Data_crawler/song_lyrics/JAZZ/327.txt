Song Name: Eshay
Ay, ay (Futile)
We got big stacks, lil' cap, real fat, time, uh
Make tracks, make cash, big facts on me
Hit that, roll black and the bands on me
Drip-drip, got that Gucci on my lens, I really can't complain
Isolate? Yeah, I'm really number one
You can ask your mates, they'll probs know my name
Alert the gang that Esh comin', fuckin' it up
Like Esh come fuckin' it up, ay, ay
Like I heard of this, I murder this, I spend it in a day
'Cause I'm earning this, the bare naked
The all black and Birkin bitch
Life hoping that they learn from this
We gon' pull up with a stick-stick that clip-clip
Got my homies dip-dip, like tiger
I'm on fire, drift from Designer, she likin' my attire
I'm hitting the dash in the fourth, fuckin' up the tyres
Think I'm stuck in the loop
I think they'd up and miss 'em 'cause I'm stuck in the booth
Right now, I'm on top, my boys stopped
Until me and my boys chilling in the Ford, droptop
Like, fill up my cup with some Cartier
Can't say it to the sheisy, they cardiac
I could fuck this bitch just to start my day
This some lean in my cup, this ain't a Chardonnay
Nah, the news cunts mention my name
I'm flexing the game, you're probably sucking dick for some fame
That kinda funny, wishing that shit cunt get dumped
Which I just put the funds in, you be at some dumb shit
One hit, then I make another, then fuck without a rubber
That's what you made undercover
My boys silent, dare they chat, just made that cash
It was a hook, play that back
We got big stacks, lil' cap, real fat, time, uh
Make tracks, make cash, big facts on me
Hit that, roll black and the bands on me
Drip-drip, got that Gucci on my lens, I really can't complain
Isolate? Yeah, I'm really number one
You can ask your mates, they'll probs know my name
Alert the gang that Esh comin', fuckin' it up
Like Esh come fuckin' it up, ay
My Esh cunt really fuckin' it up
Put double in my cup, I made it so the lovin' would stop
The pursuit, we gonna fuckin' back better, good
The next day get paid like I'm shootin' some hoops
I'm up next, she gets undressed
Tonne of dreads on the dresser, don't make assumptions, like
This ain't dirty money, gave it a bird bath
Thinking if I didn't rap, she would've flirt back
Somersault to the game
It ain't the same in my range
Fuck with us and get the flames, yeah
Diamonds gonna drip, making it rain
Foreign bitch, ain't no pronouncing her name
Nah, yeah we vicious, we doing missions
Pussy wet, got it dripping, he's got it pimpin', now who's winnin'?
Yeah, she said she lovin' it, Eshay
Said I'm from Adly, let's go and get the yard, babe
Quick get it, unleaded we leg it
He said it, we said it, one word, five letters
E-S-H-A-Y try to schedule my date line but I can make time
Nothing but fifties and hunnids in my sights
There's no way you can flow better than me
Bitch you can try, like
I said I can get her high but I can't fly
Call my Lil' Yachty, only wanted her for one night
We got big stacks, lil' cap, real fat, time, uh
Make tracks, make cash, big facts on me
Hit that, roll black and the bands on me
Drip-drip, got that Gucci on my lens, I really can't complain
Isolate? Yeah, I'm really number one
You can ask your mates, they'll probs know my name
Alert the gang that Esh comin', fuckin' it up
Like Esh come fuckin' it up, haha
East Wall, buzz
2020 taking over, no doubt
