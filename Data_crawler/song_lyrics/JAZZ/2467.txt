Song Name: Days Of Wine And Roses - Remastered
The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked 'Nevermore', that wasn't there before
The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden laugh that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
