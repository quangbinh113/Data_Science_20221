Song Name: Cold Blood
Come here boy, rest your head for a while
I know you've been traveling a long time
Come here boy, sing your songs with a smile
Watch me turn water into wine
Intoxicating creation and endless elation
You'll see the stars before sunrise
Come here boy, give me your soul for a while
You make me go weak in knees
In cold blood, I will eat you up
I'll tell you that I love you while
I lower you six feet into the ground
In cold blood, I will let you down
I will swear that I don't know you when you turn your back
When you're not around
In cold blood
In cold blood
In cold blood
In cold blood
Don't look down, it's a long, long way from home
No one's ever survived before
Wearing your crown
Assume your throne
One day all this will be yours
Intoxicating creation and endless elation
You'll see the stars before sunrise
Come here boy, give me your soul for a while
You make me go weak in knees
In cold blood, I will eat you up
I'll tell you that I love you while
I lower you six feet into the ground
In cold blood, I will let you down
I will swear that I don't know you when you turn your back
When you're not around
In cold blood
In cold blood
In cold blood
In cold blood
