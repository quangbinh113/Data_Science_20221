Song Name: Preaching To The Choir
What's that ring around your finger
Is that a hickey on your neck
Swipe my card, I'll buy the bar
I'll get drunk 'till I forget
I've been running around too
With the ex-lovers blues
In deeper lanes he still cares
That's the difference, him and you
So don't tell me
You want a different kind of fire
Boy, you're preaching to the choir
And if you tell me
There's someone who takes you higher
Boy, you're just preaching to the choir
I know you got lonely
I know you got lonely
I guess I got lonely too
Still talking shit behind my back
Hope that you can drop the act
Can we be friends
At least pretend
That there ain't no turning back
No need to tell me
You want a different kind of fire
Boy, you're preaching to the choir
And if you tell me
There's someone who takes u higher
Boy, you're just preaching to the choir
I know you got lonely
I know you got lonely
I guess I got lonely too
I know you got lonely
I know you got lonely
I guess I got lonely too
No need to tell me (Tell me)
Boy, you're preaching to the choir
And if you tell me (Tell me)
Boy, you're just preaching to the choir
No need to tell me
You want a different kind of fire
Boy, you're preaching to the choir
And if you tell me
There's someone who takes you higher
Boy, you're just preaching to the choir
I know you got lonely (I know you got)
I know you got lonely (I know you got)
I guess I got lonely too
I know you got lonely
I know you got lonely
I guess I got lonely too
