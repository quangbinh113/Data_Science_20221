Song Name: Feel The Real - Micky More & Andy Tee Classic Mix
Since we been together
Been trying to tell you how I feel
I know what I feel for you got to be real
But so far I've not been able to make you see
I've been loving you for so long
Now you're trying to make a fool out of me
I tried to make you happy
You thought you found your fool
So let your game be over
Now I know what to do
This time
Instead of making a bigger mistake
I'll walk 'cause this I don't need no more
I can't take it
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
And now we're not together
I just made up my mind
Now that the fighting's over
I got myself some time
I feel
So much better than I did yesterday
The way I am, yeah
I know good things are gonna come my way
From now on if you want to fight
You fight by yourself
'Cause I'll be getting things together
With or without, I can do it for myself
I tried to make you happy
You thought you found your fool
So let your game be over
Now I know what to do
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, dey-ah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba, aah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba-baa, dey-ah
Ah-ah, eh-hey
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba-baa, dey-ah
One more time, oh yeah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba-baa, dey-ah
Dey-ah, yeah
Ba-da, ba-ba-ba-baa, dey-ah
Ba-ba-baa, yeah
