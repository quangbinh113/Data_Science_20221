Song Name: Down by the River - 2009 Remaster
Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me, staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride, yeah
She could drag me over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, ooh, shot her dead
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today, yeah, ooh, yeah
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away, yeah
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, dead, oh, oh, shot her dead
Shot her dead
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me, staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride, ooh, yeah
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away, yeah
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
