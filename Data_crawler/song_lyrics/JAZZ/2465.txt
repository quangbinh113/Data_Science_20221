Song Name: One Note Samba [Digitally Remastered 00]
Ahh…
Ahh…
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note
Now this new one is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
There's so many people who can talk
And talk and talk and just say nothing
Or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know
And at the end I've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you.
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know.

He will find himself with no show
