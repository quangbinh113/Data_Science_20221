Song Name: Gold
All I wanna do is love you
Won't put no one above you
All I wanna do is love you
'Cause loving you is like gold
Dinner on the floor and no TV
Room was small but that didn't bother me
But that's what we called home
Loving you was like gold
All the riches in your kisses
You made me feel like a million
Like gold
If I had nothing but your touch
You know that would be enough
Like Gold
All I wanna do is love you
Won't put no one above you
All I wanna do is love you
'Cause loving you is like Gold
Chasing dreams and chasing those blue eyes
Radio playing on our ocean drives
Sandy toes and sunsets by your side
Waking up and knowing you are mine
Loving you was like gold
All the riches in your kisses
You made me feel like a million
Like gold
If I had nothing but your touch
You know that would be enough
Like gold
All I wanna do is love you
Won't put no one above you
All I wanna do is love you
Love you
Whoever said
You needed money
To be happy
Didn't know our love
Whoever said
You needed money
Didn't know our love
What we have's enough
'Cause lovers without two dimes
To rub together
Who knew this kind of life
Is all we'd ever need
Loving you was like gold
All the riches in your kisses
You made me feel like a million
Like gold
If I had nothing but your touch
You know that would be enough
Like gold
All I wanna do is love you
Won't put no one above you
All I wanna do is love you
Love you
Loving you was like gold
