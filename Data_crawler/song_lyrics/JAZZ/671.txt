Song Name: Please Don't Tease
I'm fine, I don't need anyone
You're with a girl, yes, and not alone
No boy I don't wanna dance
I ain't looking for romance
So would you please not tease
You're so tempting I feel the heat
Oh would you please not tease
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
Da da da...
I can see that you are dancing for me
But I can't join you don't you see
I'm damaged good, I'm broken hearted
I'm sure you'll only complete what is started
So would you please not tease
You're so tempting I feel the heat
Oh would you please not tease
The spirit is ready but the flesh is weak
Da da da...
But then again maybe it won't hurt
It's nothing real, just a little flirt
I've been longing for arms to hold me
Yes maybe you can set my soul free
So would you please please tease
You're so tempting I feel the heat
Oh would you please please tease
The spirit is ready but the flesh is weak
Da da da...
