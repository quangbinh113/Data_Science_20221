Song Name: You Never Ask - from 'Madame Sean Connery'
You never ask me how I've been
You never ask me how I'm carrying on
You never seem to care
You never seem to give a notice of your vacant stare
You never ask me how I've been
Ain't seen you since I don't know when
Yes, you never ask me how I've been
You never ask me how
I'll wait by the hour
Hoping one day
Maybe someday
It'll begin to change your mind
For instance
That we wake in the morning
Somewhere between the evening and the colors of those glorious skies
But you never ask me how I've been
You never offer me a glance in my direction
Don't need to focus on the story of perfection
Nothing stays the way that it begins
But you never ask me how I've been
I wish you take another look around
Don't try to get your feet back on the ground
You're floating up inside the air so thin
I say it is over
But the line that we've drawn
Speaks you're moving on
To a someday
Without a love to come along
Hmmm-mmmm
But you never ask me how I've been
You never offer me a glance in my direction
Don't need to focus on the story of perfection
Nothing stays the way that it begins
But you never ask me how I've been
I wish you take another look around
Don't try to get your feet back on the ground
You're floating up inside the air so thin
And I'll wait
And I'll wait
You never ask me how
