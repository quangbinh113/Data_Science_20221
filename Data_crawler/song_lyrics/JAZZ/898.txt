Song Name: Dream Machine - Kaskade Mix
What you thinking of
Man what you doing what you think you can do
What you are, what you do
Looking out at ripples on the dance floor
What you mean is what you get
Did you forget to know what the end is
To begin clearing
Looking out at ripples on the dance floor
Dream machine
Did you get everything you asked for
Dream machine
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
Dance floor
Dance floor
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Love's rage, broken page
Electric lights and glass bone nights
Electric lines run through your minds
Distractions with radio contraptions
Pipe ashes, night glasses
Tick tock, hear the wind lick the window
Ignited, you're invited
Grow wings sprouting from the backbone
Dream machine
Mister Jones
You don't know what you came for
Dream machine
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Dream machine
Dream machine
We are like those two mirrors
Steaming in the rain
Oh, we are those two lovers
Holding each other's hands
Dream with me
Dream with me
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
Rattlesnake a charm on the dance floor
The dance floor
The dance floor
What you thinking of
What you doing what you think you can do
What you are, what you do
Looking out at ripples on the dance floor
Dream machine
Dream machine
