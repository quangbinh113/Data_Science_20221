Song Name: Thunderclouds
Lay your burden down
Look to the sky it is raining
Open your mouth and swallow the sun
Shrouded in clouds like my love for you
Shrouded in thunderclouds like my dreams
Sometimes you have to gaze into a well to see the sky
Sometimes you have to gaze into a well to see the sky
Sometimes you have to gaze into a well to see the sky
Sometimes you have to gaze into a well to see the sky
You've been through the mud
Well, brooding through, that is all that you can do
When you've lost everything
But your sense of human, it is shroud in the thunderclouds
Like my dreams shroud in the thunderclouds
Like my love for you shroud in the thunderclouds
Like when dreams seem too good to be true
L'insomnie, en son début, est presque une oasis
Où se réfugient ceux qui ont à penser ou à souffrir
Ombrageusement
