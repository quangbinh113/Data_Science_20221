Song Name: Dearly Beloved
Dearly beloved, how clearly I see
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me
Angel eyes knew you
Angel voices led me to you
Nothing could save me, fate gave me a sign
I know that I'll be yours, come shower or shine
So I say merely
Dearly beloved be mine
Dearly beloved, how clearly I see
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me
Angel eyes knew you
Angel voices led me to you
Nothing could save me, fate gave me a sign
I know that I'll be yours, come shower or shine
So I say merely
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved be mine
