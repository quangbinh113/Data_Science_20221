Song Name: Cannonball
(Check, check, check
One, two, one, two)
Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
On the last splash
I know you, little libertine
I know you're a real cuckoo
(Hey now)
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
(Hey now) In the shade
In the shade
(Hey now) In the shade
In the shade
I know you, little libertine
I know you're a cannonball
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

(Hey now) In the shade
(Hey now) In the shade
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
I'm the last splash
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song
(Hey
Hey now)
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
Want you, cuckoo
Cannonball
(Hey now) In the shade
In the shade
(Hey now) In the shade
In the shade
