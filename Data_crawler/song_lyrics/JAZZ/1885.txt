Song Name: Most of the Time
Most of the time, I'm clear, focused all around
Most of the time, I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it on the road, unwind
I can handle whatever, I stumble upon
I don't even notice, he's gone, he's gone, most of the time

Most of the time, it's well understood
Most of the time, I wanna change it if I could
I can make it on Metro, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive and I can do all
I don't even think about him as much before
Most of the time
Most of the time, he ain't even here enough
I wouldn't know him if I saw him, he's that far behind
Oh, most of the time I can't even be sure
If he was ever with me or if I was ever with him, most of the time
Most of the time
I'm halfway content, most of the time
I know exactly where it hurts
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are burning inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don't even care if I ever see him again
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
