Song Name: Eternally
(Note: also known as "theme from limelight" and "terry's theme")
I'll be loving you eternally
With a love that's true, eternally
From the start, within my heart
It seems i've always known
The sun would shine
When you were mine
And mine alone
I'll be loving you eternally
There'll be no one new, my dear, for me
Though the sky should fall
Remember i shall always be
Forever true and loving you
Eternally
Though the sky should fall
Remember i shall always be
Forever true and loving you
Eternally
