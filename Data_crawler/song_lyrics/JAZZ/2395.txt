Song Name: Lover Man
I don't know why
But I'm feeling so sad
I long to try
Something I've never had
Never had no kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
The night is cold
And I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul
Just to call you my own
Got the moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed
With the prayer that you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweeet
Little things in my ears
A huggin' and a kissin'
Ooh, what we've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
Lover man, where can you be?
