Song Name: Love You Anymore
Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
Hoping that I'd run into you one last time
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind
Just because I accidentally slipped and said your name
Well I heard your song, it makes me insecure
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
Am I lying to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had
Am I lying to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change
And I'd do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
Am I lying to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had
Am I lying to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change
And do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore, more
Doesn't mean I love you anymore (anymore, anymore)
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
