Song Name: Black Coffee
I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room
I'm talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock 'til four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry
Now a man is born to go a-lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moanin' all the mornin'
And mornin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around
