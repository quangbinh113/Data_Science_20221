Song Name: Goodbye Blue Sky
Ooh, ooh
D-d-did you see the frightened ones?
D-d-did you hear the falling bombs?
D-d-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?
Ooh, ooh
D-d-did you see the frightened ones?
D-d-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye, blue sky
Blue sky
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
