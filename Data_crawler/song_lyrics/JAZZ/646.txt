Song Name: Fly Me to the Moon
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand

In other words, darling, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please, be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please, be true
In other words, I love you
Well, in other words, I love you
