Song Name: Greed
Well I know
What is rare only rarely lasts forever
And there's no place like home
Like this place that we've found together
And so it is
So I won't resist
We'll only miss violets till the roses grow
Well I dare not defy
This world that comes and goes
But I'd rather you stay
And these words couldn't hold
Who you are or what you mean to me
For the moment I know
There's nothing quite like you to me
So be free but be mine
And with time I've come to find
My greed just might be the end of me
How lovely you are
Well I know what remains
And I've wondered this forever
If that truth stays the same
Let's be true you and I
