Song Name: The Mambo Craze
Why, Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears?
My heart is strained with bloodness
Oh look, the orchestra is getting ready,
Dance with me, George!
Check the scene outside of Medellin.
Make a fuss in Caracas
Mixed guys and dark men at the bars
Mambo's slow Guantanamo
Was so glad escape in Trinidad
Outside down in Kingston town
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota
Space cake brake at the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Out for a dance in a dive in Puerto Prince
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time, for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
A little weak, a little pale today
Rip 'em up
Space cake brake on the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time, for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time, for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
