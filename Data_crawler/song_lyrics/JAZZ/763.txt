Song Name: Jamirobeegees Mashup: Stayin' Alive / Virtual Insanity
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women walk
Then hit the roud since I was born
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, Oooh...
That's going nowhere
Somebody help me, somebody help me yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have, Oh
Useless, twisting, over new technology
Oh now there's no sound but we all live underground
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, Oooh...
That's going nowhere
Somebody help me, somebody help me yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have, Oh
Useless, twisting, over new technology
Oh now there's no sound but we all live underground
That's going nowhere
Somebody help me, somebody help me yeah
That's going nowhere
Somebody help me, somebody help me YEAAAH
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have, Oh
Useless, twisting, over new technology
Oh now there's no sound but we all live underground Oooh
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have, Oh
Useless, twisting, over new technology
Oh now there's no sound but we all live underground
Live underground
Live underground
