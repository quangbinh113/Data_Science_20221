Song Name: Dancing With Your Ghost
Hmm-hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm
Yellin' at the sky
Screamin' at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I'm still your girl
Holdin' on too tight
Head up in the clouds
Heaven only knows where you are now
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

Never got the chance
To say a last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
