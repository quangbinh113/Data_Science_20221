Song Name: Seize The Day
Hold them close
Petals of a rose
Thorns as well
Friends and foes
Have no fear
I don't mind whatever happens
I don't care whatever happens
Let them burn
Things of cotton
Admire the fire
Things undone
There's applause
There'll be encores
You're sincere
That's what we're
Have no fear
I don't mind whatever happens
I don't care whatever happens
