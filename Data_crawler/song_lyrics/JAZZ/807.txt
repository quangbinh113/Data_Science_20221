Song Name: Get Get On
You and me
Wakin' up to seaside views
A cabana in the back
Can't you see
We can make our dreams come true
Only got one bag to pack
Through the seasons of time
And the scenes that come to mind
There is only one thing to do
Go on and
Shake it where you walk
- Can I get fries with that?
Time is flyin' "tick-tock"
- Hey what's up, where you at?
They'll say "take it slow"
- But darlin' you will know
Girl it's time to go!
And get yа get get on
Summer days
Sippin' bubbles of champagne
Not a worry in the world
Feelin' right
Makin' movies in your mind
Like it's goin' outta style
Well the energie flows
Where it stops no one will know
There is only one thing to do
Go on and
Shake it where you walk
- Can I get fries with that?
Time is flyin' "tick-tock"
- Hey what's up, where you at?
They'll say "take it slow"
- But darlin' you will know
Girl it's time to go!
And get yа get get on
