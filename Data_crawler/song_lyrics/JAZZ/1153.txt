Song Name: PAINLESS
Had to cut her off, it was painless
Showed me fake love, it was shameless
I should've known that we would never make it
Now my heart is cold, feeling vacant, I just wanna move on
And I don't know how I could be so dumb
Lied to me and said you wouldn't run
The echoes in my head go on and on
But I'll be fine, I'm better off without you
Yeah, you really know how to mess up a good thing
Acting like you care, you weren't there for my dark days
How could I have been so blind, let you walk right over me
I gave you time, now I'm off that
I don't wanna run away from all of my mistakes
But I'm so ashamed of all the time I waste
Now I do my own thing, I won't let you slow me down
Went my own way, yeah, you barely know me now
Lost another one, life goes on
I'll find another one, it won't take long now
How many times will this happen to me?
But I guess I don't mind
Had to cut her off, it was painless
Showed me fake love, it was shameless
I should've known that we would never make it
Now my heart is cold, feeling vacant, I just wanna move on
And I don't know how I could be so dumb
Lied to me and said you wouldn't run
The echoes in my head go on and on
But I'll be fine, I'm better off without you
Still sending me texts, but I don't care
Try to get in my head, but it goes nowhere
I been focused on the better me, maybe you should try that
If you did, then maybe I would write back
I'm not letting you pretend that we could
Have a happy ending, our love is fading
I left, and I'll never come back
Can't believe I ever wanted you so bad
Lost another one, life goes on
I'll find another one, it won't take long now
How many times will this happen to me?
But I guess I don't mind
Had to cut her off, it was painless
Showed me fake love, it was shameless
I should've known that we would never make it
Now my heart is cold, feeling vacant
I just wanna move on
And I don't know how I could be so dumb
Lied to me and said you wouldn't run
The echoes in my head go on and on
But I'll be fine, I'm better off without you
