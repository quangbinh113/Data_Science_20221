Song Name: Nothing's the Same
You go ahead, I think I'll stay in for the winter
Can't quite remember when I even got this bitter
And how do you live like that?
So uncomplicated by the weather in December
Think I'll stay in for the winter
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember
You go ahead, you're probably better off without me
Just take a look at all the heartbreak that surrounds me
Oh, how do you live like that?
So at peace with all the war
Whatever, like I said, you're probably better off without me
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever
It gets hard to remember
