Song Name: Art History, Pt. 1
In a house, she shows me a picture of her favorite painting.
I learned about it in my history class last year.
She doesn't like the way impressionism makes her dizzy.
Dipping the brush in one too many shades of blue.
Now I just want my lovely girl
To be back here with me.
And she just wants her lovely boy
To ask her how she's doin' lately.
Yeah, how you doin lately?
Baby just take me.
She got a brand new painting up in her room
And we watch the colors move.
So I got out just to find her just what she deserves.
Why do you like the things that you like?
And why do you smile and the things that make you smile?
Just like your voice, and just like your art.
I finally see what sets you apart.
Like my lovely girl
To be back here with me.
She just wants her lovely boy
To ask her how shes doing lately
Yeah, how you doin lately?
Baby just take me.
Yeah, how you doin lately?
Baby just take me.
Oh, how you doin lately?
Baby just take me.
