Song Name: We Don't (Still Water)
Blik dap dap di ba boo ba
Blik dap dap di ba boo ba
Blik dap dap di bab
(We don't) we don't, we don't
Sometimes it seems so hard to find
The reason why I'm staying around
Dreaming yesterday, loving today
Been lying to myself, I said it's okay
So that's my story
I can't be romantic
I'd rather fight than leave these troubles
But girl, don't worry
It's just my kind of crazy
You're my reflection in still water
Until the rain comes down
Until the rain comes down (ba da da da da)
I know you say I'm hard to handle
Really, it's all because of you
Problems yesterday
I bring up today
I just don't understand
It still feels right
So that's my story
I always get so moody
I'd rather fight than leave these troubles
But boy, don't worry
You're just my kind of crazy
You're my reflection in still water
Until the rain comes up (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Until the rain comes up (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ba bliki dap dap di ba boo ba
Ba bliki dap dap di ba boo ba
Ba bliki dap dap di bab
We don't care
Ba bliki dap dap di ba boo ba
Ba bliki dap dap di ba boo ba
Ba bliki dap dap di bab
We don't care
So that's our story
Things aren't always easy
I'd rather fight than breathe these troubles
But don't you worry
We're just kind of crazy
You're my reflection in still water
So that's our story
Things aren't always easy
I'd rather fight than breathe these troubles
You're my reflection in still water
Until the rain comes
You tell me I'm crazy
Look at you
Isn't that exactly what I am with you?
You drive me crazy
Drive me and sing
Hmm, my mother drive around my lover
We got it best, got it best
So good, so good
So good, so good
It's so good
