Song Name: Whisper Not
Sing low, Sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer
Sing on, until
You bring back the thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon
Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last
So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally
Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
Gossiping voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up
If we forget 'em all, and answer Cupid's call
It's the truth!
Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
All it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not of rumours
But of your love for me
That's how it's got to be
