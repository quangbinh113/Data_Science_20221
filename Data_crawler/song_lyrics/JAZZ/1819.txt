Song Name: YouÂ´ve Got A Friend (Bossa Version)
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've go to do is call
And I'll be there yeah yeah yeah
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Should get dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon I'll be knocking upon door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there yeah yeah yeah
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
They'll take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Oh baby don't you know that
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there yeah yes I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Oh yeah, you've got a friend
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
