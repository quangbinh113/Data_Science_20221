Song Name: A Time for Spring
I love to sing
About all the colours of spring
When they'll come
Dancing on a carpet of dreams
And there you are
Soft light breeze
Scent a breeze
And I love to think
About all the poems worth saying
I love to think
About all the flowers and things
Bouquet of buzz
Your eyes will bring
I clearly see
Brighter days
Wild embrace
And I love to think
About all the poems worth saying
I love to think
About all the colours of spring
When they'll come
Dancing on a carpet of dreams
And there you are
Soft light breeze
Scent a breeze
And I clearly see
The brightest days
When you come to me
