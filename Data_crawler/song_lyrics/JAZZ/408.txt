Song Name: Umbrella
You have my heart
We'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh
These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's raining
Oh, baby, it's raining
You can always come here to me
Come here to me
It's raining
Oh, baby, it's raining
You can always come here to me
Come here to me
It's raining
Oh, baby, it's raining
You can always come here to me
Come here to me
It's raining
Oh, baby, it's raining
You can always come here to me
Come here to me
