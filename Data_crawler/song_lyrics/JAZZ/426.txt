Song Name: Baby I Got Issues
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing but you always got me in too deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
I-I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
Everything you say make me look the other way
I don't wanna know so I'ma let it fade
Baby, I got issues but I love myself
(B-b-baby, I got issues but I love myself)
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing but you always got me in too deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Used to be the lowest, now I'm up
I-I-I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
Tryna do my thing but you always got me in too deep
Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe
You keep making faces that I don't wanna see
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Oh, na-na-na-na, don't you talk to me, talk to me
Used to be the lowest, now I'm up
I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
I-I-I don't like the way you talk to me, saying you can talk to me
However you like, I know that ain't right
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk to me
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk
I don't like the way you talk to me, talk-talk to me
But I like the way you talk to me, talk to me
