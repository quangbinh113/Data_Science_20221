Song Name: Brother Bill
Well, me and brother Bill went a huntin'
Away up in the hills of Maine
The reason why we went up there
We thought we'd catch some gain.
And as we were a huntin' away
In the middle of the night
We shot somethin' that looked like a grizzly bear
The doggone thing turned white.
Well, I dropped that gun
And away I run
My brother Bill says boy
What's the matter with you?
And he'd known like me
He'd've ran some too
Well, I'd ran so fast to say
And they couldn't catch me all day.
Away I'd run cross that field
They couldn't catch me with an automobile
My brother Bill got so excited
He commited shootin' at me
I heard those bullets sizzlin'
All among those trees.
I was runnin' so fast that night
My feet wasn't touchin' the ground
I heard a little tailbird in the tree
Singing he's Alabamy bound.
Well I'm goin' home
I'm all alone
My brother Bill says boy
What's the matter with you?
And he'd known like me
He'd've cut out too
Well, I run so fast to say
And they couldn't catch me all day.
Away I run cross that field
They couldn't catch me with an automobile.
No, they couldn't catch me with an automobile...
