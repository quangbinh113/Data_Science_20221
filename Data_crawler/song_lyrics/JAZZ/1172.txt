Song Name: Good Pills
They say an angel drive a man insane
Feels like I'm dying in the pouring rain
Need one good ol' pill a-just to kill the pain
Feel like chemicals are runnin' a-through my brain
Pills! Good pills
Pills! Good pills
They say an angel drive a man in tears
Feels like I'm living on for years and years
Can't feel my pain, I can't feel my fears
Got a chemical fix just to twist the gears
Pills! Good pills
Pills!
Don't forget now to take your pills
Know you won't because you can't stop
Don't forget now to take your pills
Know you won't because you can't stop
Know you won't because you can't stop
Know you won't because you can't stop
You can't stop
You can't stop
