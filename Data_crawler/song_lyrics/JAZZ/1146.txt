Song Name: Meteorite - From "Bridget Jones's Baby" Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
I don't know how it led to this
I felt a tremor in your kiss
Earth shakes, and I answer it
My body realigns
It's too much, I cannot handle this
I taste, the pleasure on your lips
You make, planets start to spin
I'm ready to ignite
Let me feel your devotion
Let me feel your emotion
Love me like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
Hit me like a meteorite, woah
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
You've been, following the rush
I've sinned, but I keep it hush
You're near, but it's not enough
I need this to survive
Reckless, what I'm heading for
Lights flash, and I hear a roar
One touch and you're so powerful
You're burning through the night
Let me feel your devotion
Let me feel your emotion
Love me like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
Hit me like a meteorite, woah
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
I can feel it coming tonight
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Our path turned to stone
Everything's falling
In silver and gold,
Colour's are warning
And I see it, gold
When I look to the sky
I want it all tonight,
I want it all tonight
Hit me like a meteorite, woah
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
I can feel it coming tonight
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
