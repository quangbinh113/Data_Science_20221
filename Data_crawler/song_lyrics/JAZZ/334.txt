Song Name: Might Be - Remix
Wait
Let's get (high)
3, ayy (run for cover)
I got a feeling that you might be (high)
Do I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (high)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and I'm (high)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed, she just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby
Is you rolling? I might be
You the shit, you the sugar, honey, iced tea
What I got to hint for
You know I'm a nympho
On my Marshawn Lynch
You know what I'm here for (aye)
Ride through the city and get (high)
Take you to the crib and have one hell of a night
It's ironic 'cause we on cloud (high)
Girl, make up your mind
Is you mine or you mine? (Aye)
Henny what I'm drinking, she got Remy in her cup
She break down the weed
I break down the dutch
Body like J'lo after (high), she had enough
She caught contact, now she tryna fuck
Girl, I love it when we (high)
Do it turn you on? Shawty tell me if I'm wrong
I can see it in your eyes when you (high)
That you feeling my vibes, baby, you ain't gotta lie
