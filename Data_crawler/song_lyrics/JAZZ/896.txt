Song Name: Twin Peaks
Here am I, sleep walking in the light
With my eyes closed with all my mind
What am I seeking, when life ain't
I'm so afraid of what might
I'm filled with fear it might, might
What it is inside of me
They say that you are the only one
To talk some sense into me
They say that you are the only one
Take away this pain from me
Can you see
Can you see
Tender with my heart, don't play with me
Let's leave this game out, hide and seek
Pick what's yours just leave me be
They say that you are the only one
To talk some sense into me
They say that you are the only one
Take away this pain from me
Can you see
What is this inside me
Is that all there is
Afraid to look behind me
But I will
Time is running out
Not much left here to gain
They say that you are the only one
To talk some sense in me
They say that you are the only one
Take away this pain from me
Can you see
Can you see
(Outro)
Sometimes we rush
Yes we rush too much
Sometimes we rush
Yes we rush too much
You make me chase you
Yes something is wrong
