Song Name: I Want U
My mind is going
I can feel it
I'm afraid
My mind is going
And I'm trying to forget
That I'm addicted to your smell,
That I'm helpless like a child beside you
My mind is going
And I'm trying to hide from you
That I'm lost and that I'm scared
Cause I'm sure I can't exist without you
You really turn me on
It lets you take control
You don't believe in compromise
It could be so straight
But now I think it's too late, late to care about it
Baby, I want you
Only you can tempt me twice
I want you
Don't you use my lust to blind my eyes?
Baby, I want you!
Dancing on the edge of a knife
I want you
Only you can bring me back to life
My mind is going
I can feel it
I'm afraid
