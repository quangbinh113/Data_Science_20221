Song Name: I Won't Cry Anymore
I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you've gone
I've shed a million tears since we've been apart
Now that it's got to end, not tears could ever mend a broken heart
I won't sigh anymore, no, I'll just forget you
For I'm closing the doors of memories
Although you're the one love my arms are yearning for
Baby, this is goodbye and I won't cry anymore
(I won't cry anymore)
