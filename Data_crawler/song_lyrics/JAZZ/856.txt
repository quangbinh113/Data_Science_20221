Song Name: Pablo's Blues
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
You better come on in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors.
Ah, the woman I love took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors.
Oh-ah, she's gone I know she won't come back
I've taken the last nickel out of her 'nation sack
You better come on in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors.
(Spoken: 'Baby, can't you hear that wind howl 'n' all?'
'Oh-y', can't you hear that wind would howl?')
You better come on in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors.
When a woman gets in trouble everybody throws her down
Looking for her good friend none can be found
You better come on in my kitchen
Babe, it's gon' to be rainin' outdoors
Winter time's comin' hit's gon' be slow
You can't make the winter, babe that's dry long so
You better come on in my kitchen
'Cause, it's gon' to be rainin' outdoors.
