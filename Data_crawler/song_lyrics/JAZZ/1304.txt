Song Name: Devil
If I lie when I say that I'm getting emotional
Let me try to express all the things that you want me to
One, I feel nothing
Two, I got something
Three, I need you near
You're the only one that never fools around here, so
You, won't ever break
Every time that you fuck with me, I wanna let you go
But I can't 'cause I don't really know how to let you know
One, I feel nothing
Two, I got something
Three, I need you near
You're the only one that never fools around here, so
You, won't ever break
You, won't ever break
You, won't ever break
You, won't ever break
