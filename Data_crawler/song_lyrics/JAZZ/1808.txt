Song Name: What A Difference A Day Made
What a difference a day made, twenty four little hours
Bought the sun and the flowers, where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine
And, what a difference a day made
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you (Is you)
My yesterday was blue dear
Still I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine
Oh what a difference a day makes

There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you (Is you, is you)
