Song Name: Positively Inclined
Hello, hello Mr. Tailor
What do, what do, what do you want
Turn on the radio
I'm talking to you

Get high, slow down
Now it's pretty late
Why don't you, uh, switch on the radio
I refuse to discuss it anything
So, please, please, you must
Please, please, don't treat me like a mental patient
Do you believe them
Not for a second
Do you realise what this mean
Don't look for it Tailor
That's the radio
Thank you, Mr. Tailor
