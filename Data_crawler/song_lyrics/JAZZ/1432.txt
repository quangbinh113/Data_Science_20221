Song Name: Do Nothing 'Til You Hear From Me
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please, do nothin' 'til you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
