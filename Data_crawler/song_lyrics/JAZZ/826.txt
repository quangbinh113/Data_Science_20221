Song Name: Never Let You Go
Boy, you got it going on
Ever since you came along
On and on and on and on
Boy, you got it going on
Ever since you came along
My head keeps spinning round and round
My head keeps spinning round and round and round
My head keeps spinning round and round and round
Ever since you came along
My head keeps spinning round and round and round
Ever since you came along
Ever since you came along
Boy, you got it going on
You got it going on
Nothing's been the same
Ever since you came
I'll never let you go again
Flowers in my kitchen sink
Boy, you got it going on
On and on and on and on
Boy, you got it going on
Ever since you came along
My head keeps spinning round and round and round
Ever since you came along
Ever since you came along
Boy, you got it going on
You got it going on
You got it going on
