Song Name: I'm Confessin' (That I Love You)
I'm confessin' that I love you tell me do you love me too
I'm confessin' that I need you honest I do
Need you every moment in your eyes I read such strange things
But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things making me blue
I'm afraid someday you'll leave me saying can't we still be friends
If you go you know you'll grieve me all in life on you depends
Am I guessin' that you love me dreamin' dreams of you in vain
I'm confessin' that I love you over again
(I'm afraid someday you'll leave me saying can't we still be friends)
If you go you know you'll grieve me all in life on you depends
Am I guessin' that you love me dreamin' dreams of you in vain
I'm confessin' that I love you over again
