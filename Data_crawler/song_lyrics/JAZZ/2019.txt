Song Name: Mack the Knife
Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe
And he keeps it out of sight
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red
Now on a sidewalk, ooh Sunday mornin', uh-huh
Lies a body just oozin' life
And someone's sneakin' 'round a corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?
There's a tugboat, down by the river, don't you know?
Where a cement bag, just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get you ten Old Macky's back in town
Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?
Jenny Diver, ho-ho, yeah, Suki Tawdry
Miss Lottie Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms, on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
I said, Jenny Diver, whoa, Suki Tawdry
Look out Miss Lottie Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's
Back in town
Look out Old Mack is back!
