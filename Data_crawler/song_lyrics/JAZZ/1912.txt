Song Name: I've Got the World On a String
Merry month of May, sunny skies of blue
Clouds have rolled away and the sun peaks through
May express happiness
Joy you may define in a thousand ways
But a case like mine needs a special phrase
To reveal how I feel
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?

Life is a beautiful thing as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so if I should ever let it go
I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow
I've got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
