Song Name: Romance in the Dark
In the dark, it's just you and I
There's not a sound and there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark
Now, in the dark I get such a thrill
Well, well, when he places his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me, "Please be still
In the dark"
But soon this dance will be ending
And you're gonna, you're gonna be missed
Gee, but I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear it's fun, it's fun to be kissed
In the dark, in the dark
Now we will find
Oh, what the rest, what the rest have left behind
Just let them dance 'cause we're gonna find romance
In the dark
