Song Name: bloodline
(Because I'm trying to do the best I can)
(And they can't find something to satisfy me, look)
Mmm, yeah, yuh
Even though you're bad for me, I know
You're the one that I'm thinkin'
Got me feelin' so incredible
Would you mind maybe linkin'?
Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it, like uh
Don't want you in my bloodline, yuh
Just wanna have a good time, yuh
Ain't no need to apologise, no

Yeah, that ship sailed away
Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
