Song Name: Oh My God
I ain't got too much time to spend
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah
Oh my god, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into yours?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I'm a grown woman and I do what I want to do
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah
Oh my god, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into yours?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle I cannot fight
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (oh, Lord)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (don't let me let myself down)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (oh my god)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down"
Oh my god, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into yours?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
When it's a battle that I cannot fight
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me" (I know that it's wrong)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me" (mm, yeah)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (mm, yeah)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me" (I know that it's wrong)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me" (mm, yeah)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (mm, yeah)
