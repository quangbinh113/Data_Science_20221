Song Name: Don't Go To Strangers
Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers darling, come on to me.
Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers darling, come to me.
For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know.

I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go! So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers darling, come to me.
