Song Name: Love Is The Drug
Good evening, gentlemen
We've got a great night in store for you
I see a lotta new faces out there
As well as some familiar ones
So I'm not gonna yammer on too long
I want you all to sit back
Enjoy the service, the scenery
But most of all, enjoy the show, hit it
It ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
It ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell
Aggravated, spare for days
I troll downtown the red light place
Jump up, bubble up, what's in store?
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showin' out, showin' out, hit and run
Boy meets girl, well, the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, I can't set free
'Cause love is the drug for me
Oh, oh, love is the drug
Late that night, I park my car
Stake my place in the singles' bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumber up, limbo down
The locked embrace, the stumble around
I say, "Go" and I say, "Yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
Oh, oh, love is the drug
Oh, oh, love is, love is the drug
Good love is, good love is
Good love is, good love is
Good love is
(Love is the drug for me)

Oh, whoa, catch that buzz
'Cause love is the drug I'm thinkin' of
Oh, whoa, can't you see
Love is the drug? Got a in me
Oh, whoa, catch that buzz
'Cause love is the drug that I'm thinkin' of
Oh, whoa, can't you see
Love is the drug for me?
Oh, it ain't no big thing
(It ain't no big thing)
Can't you see
Love is the drug for me?
Oh, oh, love is the drug
Oh, oh, love is, love is, love is the drug
