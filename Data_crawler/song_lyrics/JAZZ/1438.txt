Song Name: Dream A Little Dream Of Me
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear (Oh, how you linger on)
Still craving your kiss (How you crave my kiss)
Now I'm longing to linger 'til dawn dear
Just saying this (Give me a little kiss)
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss

Yeah, I'm longing to linger 'til dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams, I'm dreamin' ('Til sunbeams find you)
Keep dreamin' (Gotta keep dreaming)
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
You've gotta make me a promise (oh, yes)
Promise to me
You'll dream
Dream a little dream of me
