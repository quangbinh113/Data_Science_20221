Song Name: U
Right now my head is a mess, thinking bout' you got me stressed
But you could probably care less, you're just so hard to impress
Everytime that we go out, you do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now
I always worry bout' you, I only tell you the truth
I'm not like those other girls, I don't be acting brand new
Everytime that we go out, you do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now
It could be u-s, there's so many letters but it's only u
Only u, only only only u, only u
My friends say you not about me, I wasn't trying to believe in
I'm always holding you down, even tho you mess around
You ain't showing me no love, you just want me too show off
Played the food but I know now
It could be u-s, there's so many letters but it's only u
Only u, only only only u, only u
It could be u-s, there's so many letters but it's only u
Only u, only only only u, only u
Boy I wish that you would see this could be us
Ooh I'm so tired of you taking advantage of love
It could be u-s, there's so many letters but it's only u
Only u, only only only u, only u
It could be u-s, there's so many letters but it's only u (it's only u)
Only u (it's only u), only only only u (it's only u), only u (it's only u)
