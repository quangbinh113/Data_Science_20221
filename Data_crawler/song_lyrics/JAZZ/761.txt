Song Name: Bad Romance
I want your ugly
I want your disease
I want your everything
As long as it's free
I want your love
Love-love-love
I want your love
I want your drama
And the touch of your hand
I want your leather studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love-love-love,
I want your love,
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want your bad
Your bad romance
I want your love
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Love-a-la-la-la,
Uma-u-mamaa
A-A-uh-la-la
Want your bad romance.
I want your horror
I want your design
'Cause you're a criminal
As long as your mine
I want your love
Love-love-love
I want your love
I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick
Want you in my rear window
Baby you're sick,
I want your love
Love-love-love,
I want your love
I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love and
I want your revenge
I want your love
I don't wanna be friends
Je veux ton amour
Et je veux ta revenge
Je veux ton amour
I don't wanna be friends
I don't wanna be friends
I don't wanna be friends
Want your bad romance!
Want your bad romance!
Let's write a bad romance
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
