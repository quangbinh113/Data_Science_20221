Song Name: You Put A Move On My Heart
Baby, I just want you to understand
Just exactly how you make me feel
Oh, yeah
I wanna feel you next to me
Time after time when I'm feeling low
Something inside of me, let's me know
It's alright, love's on my side
When the world seems a lonely place
I've got a dream that won't leave a trace
Of the blues, I just think of you
Baby I know
I got a real thing here by my side
Someone who needs me, holding me tight
And these special feelings, won't ever fade
'Cause I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on my heart
Baby our love's like a melody
Playing for us in the sweetest key
You could find the music of life
And when we touch, there's the warmest glow
Heating the passion that Heaven knows
Is a dream, just for you, you and me
And baby I know
I got a real thing, the love of my life
Someone who needs me, and he fills me with pride
Baby now, now and forever we'll never part
'Cause you're the world to me
You put a move on my heart
I got a real love, yes I do
Hey you're someone, baby, you're someone, baby
You're someone that needs a true love
And these, these special feelings, time can't erase
Baby believe me, this isn't dreaming
Sugar, I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on me
Oh, you got through to my
Oh yeah
You got through to my heart, baby
Baby, can't you see
You and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me
Hold me baby
Put your hand in mine
Love me till the end of time
Hold me, love me
Hold me baby
And don't let go
Baby can't you see
You and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me
I want you to touch me baby
Put your hand in mine
Love me till the end of time
Hold me, love me
I want you
Right here, right now
Lay by my side, sugar
Thrill me tonight
I wanna feel you in my arms baby
Oh, and you know what I love when you're loving me
Come closer
I wanna feel your body pressed against mine
Baby can't you see
You and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me
Put your hand in mine
Love me till the end of time
Hold me, love me
