Song Name: My Flame
Mmm, how long?
How long have you been away?
Oh, how long?
I can't find the words to say, yeah
I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself, oh
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me?
Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Mmm, my love
Will I ever make you see
Ooh, that somehow
You are still a part of me? Oh, yeah
Maybe we can compromise
'Cause our love just can't be disguised, oh
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me?
Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Mmm, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Mmm, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
