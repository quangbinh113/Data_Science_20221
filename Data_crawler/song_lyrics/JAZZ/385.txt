Song Name: Way Too Long - Acoustic
Really wanna call you
But if I called you up, would that be wrong?
It's funny how I loved you
Then suddenly you're nothin' but a song
Summer in the back of your car
Singin' Drake in the dark
I've been reminiscin' 'bout our love
I can't help but think about you
And the way that it was
I wish I could let go of us
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Been way too long, oh
Since you've been gone (ah)
Where have you been?
Have you found another lover?
Better than me?
I hope you don't forget all
All the things, all the love, promises, tables turned
I know it's her
Sitting in the back of your car
Singin' Drake in the dark
I've been reminiscin' 'bout our love
I can't help but think about you
And the way that it was
I wish I could let go of us
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long (ah)
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long (yeah)
Been way too long, oh
Since you've been gone
Summer in the back of your car
Singin' Drake in the dark
(Oh, it's been too long)
I can't help but think about you
And the way that it was
Baby, I should let go of us, oh
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long
It's been way too long
It's been way, way, way too long, no
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long (yeah)
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
It's been way too long
Oh, woah-oh-oh, it's been way too long
Been way too long, oh
Since you've been gone
