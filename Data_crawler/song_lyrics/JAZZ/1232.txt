Song Name: Free My Mind
Trying to free my mind
Baby, I've been travelling on my own
Trying to free my mind
Trying to free my soul
Lately, I wonder how you feel
Am I waiting for something?
Am I waiting for someone now?
Am I waiting for something?
Am I waiting for someone now?
Trying to free my mind
I've seen saints and they don't lie
And I feel time just past me by
So tell me now, I need to know
Am I waiting for a ghost?
Trying to free my mind
Am I waiting for something?
Am I waiting for someone now?
Baby, I've been travelling on my own
Trying to free my mind
Trying to free my soul
Lately, I wonder how you feel
Am I waiting for something?
Am I waiting for someone now?
Trying to free my mind
Trying to free my soul
