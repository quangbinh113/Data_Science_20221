Song Name: Too Sad To Cry
Wasn't raised religious
But I wish that I was
Havin' nothin' to believe in
Has been killin' my buzz
Yeah, I cut my hair, close the blinds
Play Hallelujah like two dozen times
And yesterday, I tried to pray
But I didn't know what to say
I'm too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk, I just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry
Can't tell my Mamma
It makes her worry
I'm not suicidal
Sometimes, the lines get all blurry
Yeah, I cut my hair, close the blinds
Played Hallelujah like two dozen times
And yesterday, I tried to pray
But I didn't know what to say
I'm too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk, I just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
I lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry
I'm too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk, I just stay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry
