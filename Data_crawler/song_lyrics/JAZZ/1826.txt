Song Name: And I Love Him
I give him all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love him too
And I love him
And I love him
He gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
He brings to me
And I love him
And I love him
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love him
And I love him
And I love him
