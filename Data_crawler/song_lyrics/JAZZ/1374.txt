Song Name: Teach Me Tonight
Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm tryin' not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Ooh, teach me tonight
Let's start with the A B C of it
Roll right down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight
The sky's a black board
High above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come on and teach me tonight
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me, please, teach me tonight
