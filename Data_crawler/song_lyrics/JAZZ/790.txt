Song Name: Bamboo Moon
Once upon a time there was an old man
He went gathering firewood in the mountains
And came upon a big bamboo dazzling in the woods
He split the bamboo
A beautiful girl appeared
Pale as moonlight
Pale as moonlight
Kawaii otokotachi ga sukina yureru kemuri
Tsukino akogareta anohi no kotoha wasuretesa
I wish I could be free but that's just a dream
Floating like a paper balloon, not trapped in a cage
Dama no kanzashi ochi, kurukuru mawaru kazaguruma
Tsuyu no ame ni nurete furete mitaiwa ten no mukou
I long to return to the moon
I wanted a place to stay but, I think, I like it here too
When men lust for me, I feel so happy
Kizu wo nameau nara, yurushite agetemo ii
Hoshii mono nado atai ni wa nai
