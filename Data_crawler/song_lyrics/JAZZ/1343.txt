Song Name: Word Of Mouth
Well, you know what's wrong with me
I keep on going on, I keep on chasing things
Type of things no good for me
They all tell me good for me
I try to not talk on it, it's all that they talk about
You know what's wrong with me
I blame that on word of mouth
Feed me, I'm hungry, I'm bleeding, take from me
I'm wounded, haunted, out here, they got me
Word of mouth, bring 'em out
Put 'em up, knock 'em down
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out
It's word of mouth, it's word of mouth
I keep on going on, I keep on chasing things
Type of things no good for me
They all tell me good for me
I try to not talk on it, it's all that they talk about
You know what's wrong with me
I blame that on word of mouth
Feed me, I'm hungry, I'm bleeding, take from me
I'm wounded, they got me out here, they got me
Word of mouth, bring 'em out
Put 'em up, knock 'em down
Chew 'em up, I'll spit 'em out
That's word of mouth, that's word of mouth
Rip your lip off, sick of your lip
Slick and smooth talk
I want to rip your lip off, sick of your lip
Rip your lip off, sick of your lip
Slick and smooth talk
I want to rip your lip off, sick of your lip
Word of mouth, bring 'em out
Put 'em up, knock 'em down
Chew 'em up, I'll spit 'em out
That's word of mouth, that's word of mouth
