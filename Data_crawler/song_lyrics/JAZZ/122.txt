Song Name: talk
Baby, I can't decide
Need your guidance, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I got nobody left to lose
When I fall, I turn to you
And the world just got confusing
And I think you need me, too
She want a night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Drive so fast and we runnin' red lights
Night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Shit won't last but I wanna make right
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?

So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (baby I...)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (can't decide)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (need your guidance)
Maybe we don't talk like we used to, like we, like we used to
Talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk like we used to, like we, like we used to
She got me runnin' round town, I surrender all of me
Oh my God, I'll give you anything you want
Maybe I forgot why you left in the first place
Way too many friends getting close...
Got me runnin' 'round town
I surrender all of me
Oh my god, I'll give you anything you want
Maybe I forgot why you left in the first place
Way too many friends getting close on your birthday
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (baby I...)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (can't decide)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (need your guidance)
Maybe we don't talk like we used to, like we, like we used to
Talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk like we used to, like we, like we used to
