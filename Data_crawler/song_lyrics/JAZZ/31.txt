Song Name: Paragraphs
How do I tell you I'm still paranoid you'll leave?
How do I tell you that I worry when you say nothing's wrong?
I'm writing paragraphs to find the words to say
Don't wanna upset you, but I needa get this weight off my chest
Lately you've been in and out of love
And I've been feeling in and out of touch
I'll keep your flowers
While I'm still waiting, playing broken guitars in my room
Maybe I don't think you ever have to leave
Maybe the way you feel is out of my control
And if I'm honest, I know having you's too good to be true
But I can't help myself from giving you my all
Not gonna stand and watch this thing we have get torn up in two
Lately you've been in and out of love
And I've been feeling in and out of touch
So I'll keep your flowers
While I'm still waiting, playing
Broken guitars
I only wish you'd call me back it's been hours
I don't think you have to leave, oh no
Even if you run away (so I'll keep your flowers)
Would you be my, runaway (while I'm still waiting)
'Cause I'll still be standing here (playing broken guitars)
For God knows how many days (I only wish you'd call me back)
Even if you run away (it's been hours)
Would you be my, runaway (I don't think you have to leave)
'Cause I'll still be standing here (oh no)
For God knows how many days
Maybe I don't think you ever have to leave
So how do I tell you I'm still paranoid you'll leave
How do I tell you that I worry when you say nothing's wrong
I'm writing paragraphs to find the words to say
Don't wanna upset you, but I needa get this weight off my chest
So I'll keep your flowers
While I'm still waiting, playing broken guitars in my room
Maybe I don't think you ever have to leave
Maybe I don't think you ever have to leave
