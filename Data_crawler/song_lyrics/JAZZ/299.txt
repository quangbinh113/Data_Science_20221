Song Name: Get Into It (Yuh)
Yuh, ayy
Huh, ayy, yuh
They say I just got a buck, get into it, yuh
Pop out with a truck, ha, get into it, yuh (yuh)
If you go to church, I said, "Get into it, yuh"
And if she ain't got a butt, now fuck it, get into it, yuh
And they say I just got a buck (get into it, yuh)
Pop out with a truck (get into it, yuh)
If you go to church (get into it, yuh)
If she ain't got a butt, fuck it, get into it, yuh
Yeah, you just wanna party, you just want a lap dance
You just wanna pop up on these clowns like you're the Batman
You just wanna ball out in designer with your best friends
You don't wanna talk no more about it in the past tense
Get me out my zone, I'm just talking comfort, shawty
I ain't give you nothing you can come for, shawty
I got plenty things you make a run for, shawty
Call him Ed Sheeran, he in love with my body
They say I just got a buck, get into it, yuh
Pop out with a truck, ha, get into it, yuh, ha
If you go to church, I said, "Get into it, yuh"
And if she ain't got a butt, now fuck it, get into it, yuh
And they say I just got a buck (get into it, yuh)
Pop out with a truck (get into it, yuh)
If you go to church (get into it, yuh)
If she ain't got a butt, fuck it, get into it, yuh
Y'all need to get into the drip like a piranha
Y'all need to get into my drip like y'all need water
I mean, it's only head to toe Balenciaga
I mean, y'all bitches better "yuh" like Ariana
If they ever tryna knock her, put my foot up in your caca
Call your mama and your papa, like I'm finna take your daughter
Turn that bitch into a soccer ball and rocka, rocka, rocka (brr)
Get into it like a suit, and fuck a stock up like a broker
They say I just got a buck (yeah), get into it, yuh, ayy
Pop out with a truck, ha, get into it, yuh (pop out, pop out)
If you go to church, I said, "Get into it, yuh"
And if she ain't got a butt, now fuck it, get into it, yuh
And I say I just got a buck (get into it, yuh)
Pop out with a truck (get into it, yuh, yeah)
If you go to church (get into it, yuh)
If she ain't got a butt, fuck it, get into it, yuh (yeah, yeah)
Thank you, Nicki! I love you!
