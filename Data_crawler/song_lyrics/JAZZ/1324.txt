Song Name: I Want To
You're on my mind
Been there all night
I've been missing seeing my midnight queen
Come have a drink
Or maybe three
And darling I'll make you my next victim
It's been too long to spend this night alone
I need to hear the sweet sound of your moans
Come have a ride, baby don't be so shy
I prefer girls who're not afraid to cry
I want to- (ah, ah, ah)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah)
In your sexy skinny jeans
I want to- (ah, ah, ah)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah)
In your sexy skinny jeans
It's been too long to leave me on my own
I need to hear the sweet sound of your moans
Come have a ride, baby give me your thighs
I prefer girls who're not afraid to cry
I want to- (ah, ah, ah)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah)
In your sexy skinny jeans
I want to- (ah, ah, ah)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah)
In your sexy skinny jeans
I want to- (ah, ah, ah) (ooh)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah) (I wanna do to you the things I shouldn't wanna do)
In your sexy skinny jeans
I want to- (ah, ah, ah) (ooh)
To make you- (ah, ah, ah)
You make me- (ah, ah, ah) (I wanna do to you the things you make me wanna do)
In your sexy skinny jeans
