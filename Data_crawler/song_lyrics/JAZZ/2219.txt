Song Name: I've Never Been In Love Before - Vocal Version
I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you for evermore
I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour
So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour
So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before
