Song Name: Walk with the Dreamers
Yeah-
Just a drop in the ocean
Just a flash in the night
Just a soul among billions
With no place to hide
The world keeps turning around
While we're sleeping safe and sound
There's still long way to go
I think I'm beginning to see the light
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
While we're sleeping safe and sound
There's still long way to go
I think I'm beginning to see the light
The world keeps turning around
While we're sleeping safe and sound
There's still long way to go
I think I'm beginning to see the light
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Keep your feet on the ground
Yeah
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Walk with your head in the clouds
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the angels
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the dreamers
Keep your feet on the ground
Walk with the angels
Walk with the dreamers
