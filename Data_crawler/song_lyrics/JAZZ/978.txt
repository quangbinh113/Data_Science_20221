Song Name: 911
911, what's your emergency?
Don't think I can take it
With every drama a piece of me dies
Like some kind of sadist
I think that he likes to see the pain in my eyes
He knows that I'm lovesick
He kissed me and promised I will be alright
We both know it's bullshit
The longer I'm with him the less I'm alive
Doctor's on the other line
'Cause he's not coming home tonight
And I just took my very last pill
Need something to numb the pain
Demons knocking on my brain
I think they coming in for the kill
911, I need someone
My baby plays me like a game
I'm not having fun
911, tell him he's
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done 'cause
I, I, I gotta lose my guy
Or, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose my mind
You must think that I'm crazy
Well he does too so I guess that makes three
Need someone to save me
I'd really appreciate if you'd intervene
Doctors on the other line
'Cause he's not coming home tonight
Can't seem to find my bottle of pills
Swear to God I'm not insane
The voices only say his name
When I'm starting to think that they're real
911, I need some (need someone)
My baby please me like a game
I'm not having fun (not having fun)
911, tell him he's
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done 'cause
I, I, I gotta lose my guy
Or, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose my mind
911, I need some (need someone)
My baby please me like a game
I'm not having fun (not having fun)
911, tell him he's
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done 'cause (gotta be, gotta be done)
I, I, I gotta loose my guy (I, I)
Or, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose my mind
