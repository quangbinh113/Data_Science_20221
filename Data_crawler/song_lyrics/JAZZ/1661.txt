Song Name: Blame It On My Youth - Remastered 1999
I live my life, one after the other
Can't seem to shake trouble
Ollows me where ever I go
My mama told me I was always in a hurry
You'd better slow down or you'll lose control
I've loved and lost for the moment
It never lasted long enough
You come to me when something gets broken
But I won't let it get me down
Blame it on my youth
Put it to the circumstances
Blame it on my youth
I can't be judged for my actions
I'm an accident waiting to happen
Blame it on my youth
Someday I might stop being a child
But for now it looks as though
I'm havin' too much fun
You're as young as you feel
From the inside
Inside and out you're always on the run
Angel's with dirty faces
A little lost and innocent
Time steals people and places
But I won't let it get me down
Repeat Terror-Guitar Solo
I've loved and lost for the moment
It never lasted long enough
You come to me when
Something gets broken
But I won't let it get me, baby.
Repeat
