Song Name: Good Time - R3HAB Remix
(Good-good-good time)
(I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time)
(I got enough on my mind)
I just, I just, I just
Wanna get drunk with my friends
Talk about some nonsense
With girls that we just met
I just, I just, I just
Wanna go out, midnight
Low key, no fights
I'm messed up, man, you drive
I just, I just, I just
Wanna tell the barback line 'em up ('em up)
'Cause the whole world needs some love
I just want a good time, I
I just want a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just want a (good), I just want a
I just want a good time, I
I just want a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just want a, I just want a
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I just good-good-good time
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I got enough on my mind
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I just good-good-good time
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I got enough on my mind (I just want a)
I just, I just, I just want a
Catch vibes with strangers
Find out we're neighbors
From back in LA, yeah
I just, I just, I just
Wanna call up my exes
Wish them the bestest
I'm that kinda wasted
I just, I just, I just
Wanna tell the barback line 'em up (ah-ah-ah-oh)
'Cause the whole world needs some love
I just want a good time, I
I just want a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just want a (good), I just want a
I just want a good time, I
I just want a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just want a, I just want a
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I just good-good-good time
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I got enough on my mind
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I just good-good-good time
I just, I just, I just want a good-good-good time
I got enough on my mind (I just wanna)
I just, I just, I just want a
Stop stressin' and start counting blessings, yeah
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Stop obsessin' and just start lettin' it all go
I just want a good time, I
I just want a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just want a, I just want a
I just, I just, I just want a
