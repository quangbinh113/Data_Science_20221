Song Name: Something Cool - Mono
Something cool,
Something cool,
Something cool,
I'd like to order something cool!
Something cool, (something cool)
I'd like to order something cool, (something cool)
It's so warm here in town,
And the heat gets me down,
Yes, I'd like something cool! (something cool)
My! It's nice to simply sit and rest awhile,
Now I know it's a shame,
I can't think of your name,
I remember your smile!
I don't ordinarily drink with strangers,
I most usually drink alone.
You were so awfully nice to me,
And I'm so terribly far from home.
Like my dress? I must confess it's terribly old,
But it's simple and neat,
It's just right for the heat,
Save my furs for the cold!
A cigarette? Well I don't smoke them as a rule,
But I'll have one,
It might be fun
With something cool!
I'll bet you couldn't imagine
That I one time had a house
With so many rooms I couldn't count them all!
I'll bet you couldn't imagine
I had fifteen different beaus
Who would beg and beg to take me to a ball.
I'll bet you couldn't picture me
The time I went to Paris in the Fall,
And who would think the man I loved was quite so handsome,
Quite so tall?
Well it's true, (something cool)
It's just a memory I have, (something cool)
One I almost forgot
'Cause the weather's so hot!
And I'm feeling so bad (something cool)
About a date,
Oh wait!
I'm such a fool!
He's just a guy
Who's stopped to buy
Me something cool!
