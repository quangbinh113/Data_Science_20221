Song Name: Happy
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news talking this and that
Yeah, give me all you got, don't hold me back
Yeah, well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
Yeah, no offense to you don't waste your time
Here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Happy, bring me down, can't none
Bring me down, my level's too high
Bring me down, can't none
I said (let me tell you now)
Bring me down, can't none
Bring me down, my level's too high
Bring me down, can't none
I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Happy, bring me down, can't none
Bring me down, my level's too high
Bring me down, can't none
I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along, if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm haá¹—py
Clap along, if you feel like that's what you wanna do
