Song Name: This Masquerade
Are we really happy here
With this lonely game we play?
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding
Understanding any way
We're lost in a mask, masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of weeping disappear
Every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try, oooh
To understand the reasons
That we carry on this way
We're lost in a mask, masquerade
