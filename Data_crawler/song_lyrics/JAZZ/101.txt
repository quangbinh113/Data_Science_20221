Song Name: Say Less
In this perfect moment
All my cards are folding
Just wanna feel your hands on mine
I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Please, just stop with all the speaking
Won't you let me love you blind?
We ain't been here before
But i've been here
And you've been here too
There's something in the water
That makes me wanna give it all
All to you
Say less
Won't you say less
So I can give in more
I can give in more
Say less, say less, say less
So I can give in more
I can give in more

From where did you come from?
You don't act like any other one
You have no doubt, bless these eyes (oooh)
Let's tear down any fences
And take away four of our senses
So all we can do is feel tonight

We ain't been here before
But i've been here
And you've been here too

There's something in the water
That makes me wanna give it all
All to you
Say less
Won't you say less
So I can give in more
I can give in more
Say less, say less, say less
So I can give in more
I can give in more
