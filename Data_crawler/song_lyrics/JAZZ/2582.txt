Song Name: My Man
Sometimes I say
If I just could get away
With my man
He'd go straight
Sure as fate
For it never
Is too late
For a man
I just like
To dream
Of a cottage
By a stream
With my man
Where a
Few flowers
Grew
And perhaps
A kid or two
Like my man
And then
My eyes
Get wet
I most forget
â€˜Til he gets hot
And tells me
Not to talk
Such rot
Oh my man
I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is
Just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me
In his arms
The world is
Bright
All right
What's the difference
If I say
I'll go away?
When I know I'll
Come back
On my knees
Someday
For whatever
My man is
I'm his
Forever
More
