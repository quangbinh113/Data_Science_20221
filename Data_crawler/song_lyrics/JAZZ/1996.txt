Song Name: Come Rain or Come Shine
I'm gonna love you
Like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
Deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things

But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true, well, if you let me

You're gonna love me
Like no one's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And wouldn't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny, yeah
We're in or we're out of the money, yeah
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And wouldn't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money, yeah
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine, yeah
