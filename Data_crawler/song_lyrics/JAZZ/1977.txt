Song Name: (What A) Wonderful World
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be
Now I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For may be by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
La-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta (history)
Hmm-mmm (biology)
Well, la-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta (science book)
Mmm-mmm-mmm (French I took), yeah
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
