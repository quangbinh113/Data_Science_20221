Song Name: Tapestry
Have you seen the seven oceans?
Or the snow cap of a mountain top?
Or the northern lights set in motion?
Or a heartbeat slow to a stop?
Have you read a book by candlelight?
Or heard a leader's call to arms?
Have you ever felt my love burns so bright
Like a fireball in your palms?
More
Than all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
More
Than all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry
Have you felt a revolution?
Do you ever sit to stop and pause
Just to take a little moment

To see what's mine and yours?

More
Than all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
More
Than all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry
These aren't just lines of latitude
That we made up
Drawn upon a map
We could be meeting with more than minds
We could be woven and intertwined
More
Than all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
More
Than all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry
