Song Name: Magic Moments (with Mitchell Ayres and His Orchestra & The Ray Charles Singers)
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
I'll never forget the moment we kissed
The night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While takin' a sleigh ride
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love
The telephone call that tied up the line
For hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love
The way that we cheered whenever our team was scoring a touchdown
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down
(The penny arcade, the games that we played, the fun and the prizes)
The Halloween hop when everyone came in funny disguises
Magic moments
Filled with love
