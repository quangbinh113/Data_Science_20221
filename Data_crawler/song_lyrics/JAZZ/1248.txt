Song Name: Losers
Tried to climb a mountain so we can slide back down the hill
And after all just a cannon ball falling for the thrill
And When we fall we just dust it off you know we're ready to begin
Cuz Giving up is never good enough so we try and try again
Let's hear it for losers
The ones who tried didn't land it right
The losers
Leave on the line putting up a fight
The losers
Burning up but never satisfied
Keep on pushing till the day we die
The day we die or we get it right
The Losers
Come On
Aye ay aye ay aye ay
Out of minds over finish lines all our ribbons they turn green
Warn out shoes learning how to lose while we're stepping to our dream
Time went by still never satisfied we're hungry and we're lean
In our heads we're ten feet high never running out of steam
Let's hear it for losers
The ones tried didn't land it right
The losers
Leave it on the line putting up a fight
The losers
Burning up but never satisfied
Keep on pushing till the day we die or we get it right
Let's hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
Hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers losers
Hear it for losers
Come on
Let's hear it for losers
The ones who tried didn't land it right
The losers
Leave on the line putting up a fight
The losers
Burning up but never satisfied
Keep on pushing till the day we die or we get it right
Let's hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
Hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
Hear it for the losers
Let's hear it for the losers
