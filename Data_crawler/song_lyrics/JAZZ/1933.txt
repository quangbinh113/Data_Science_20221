Song Name: How Do You Keep The Music Playing
How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say? (Yeah)
And since we know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name
I know the way I feel for her, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
In her eyes I may not see forever
Forever
Tell me if we can be the best of lovers
And be, baby, be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose, the music never ends
Yes, I know (I know), the way I feel for her
It's now or never! (Now or never)
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
(Oh, the more that I'm afraid)
In her eyes I may not see forever
Forever (forever), forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Maybe we can be, ooh, be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck, I suppose the music ne-, ne-
Never, never, never ends (never ends, never ends)
