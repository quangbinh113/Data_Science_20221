Song Name: Peaceful Life
Oh-oh-oh
Slow down baby slow down
Don't make a sound
Make your soul
A river flow and
Let it all out
Now you can shout
Scream it out loud
Let em know
To leave you alone
For a peaceful life peaceful life
I feel the wonders the sun in light through the light
I know that everything will alright be alright
That's the elation of a peaceful life
And every thing gonna be alright, yeah
See when everything goes wrong
You gotta learn to fly
So that you can find your way
Off to paradise so
Put in your brain
Make it the same
Don't you know you're beautiful
Feel your embrace
Hold yourself sane
You've got all to gain
Take it all
It's your own now
For a peaceful life peaceful life
I feel the wonders the sun in light through the light

That's the elation of a peaceful life
And every thing gonna be alright
When the thunder turns to rain
You gotta dance from night to day
Go and shake your pain away
All will be ok
