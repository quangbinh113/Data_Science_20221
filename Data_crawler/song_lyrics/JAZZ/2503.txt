Song Name: This Bitter Earth / On The Nature Of Daylight
This bitter earth
Well, what the fruit it bears
Ooooh
This bitter earth
And if my life
Is like the dust
Oooh that hides
The glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows
Lord, this bitter earth
Yes can be so cold
Today you're young
Too soon, you're old
But while a voice
Within me cries
I'm sure someone may answer my call
And this bitter earth, oooh
May not, oh, be so bitter after all
This bitter earth
Lord, this bitter earth
What good is love
Mmmm, that no one shares
And if my life is like the dust
Oooh that hides, the glow of a rose
What good am I
What good am I
Heaven only knows
