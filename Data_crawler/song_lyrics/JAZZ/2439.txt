Song Name: When Sunny Gets Blue - Remastered
When Sunny gets blue
Her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone, what can matter
No sweet lover man comes to call
When Sunny gets blue
She breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violin
Is playing strange
And haunting melodies
People used to love to hear her laugh
See her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair
She lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same
Chorus:
When Sunny gets blue
Pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here
To kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue
(Repete 3 estrofe)
(Chorus)
