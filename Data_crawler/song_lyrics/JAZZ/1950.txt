Song Name: Can Anyone Explain?
Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss? No no no
But when two eager lips
Are pressed against yours
You'll know, yes, you'll know
Can anyone explain the glow of romance? No no no
But when you hear the phrase
"It's you I adore"
You'll know, yes, you'll know
And you will find
To give love a start
Don't think with your mind
Just feel with your heart
Can anyone explain the wonder of love? No no no
But now that you and I
Are sharing a sigh
We know, yes, we know
Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss? No no no
But when two eager lips
Are pressed against yours
Then you'll know, yes, you'll know
Can anyone explain the glow of romance? No no no
But when you hear the phrase
"It's you I adore"
Then you'll know, yes, you'll know, honey
And you will find
To give love a start
Don't think with your mind
Just feel with your heart
Can anyone explain the wonder of love? No no no
But now that you and I
Are sharing a sigh
We know, you can't miss it, yes, we know
