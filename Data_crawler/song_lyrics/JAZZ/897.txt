Song Name: Darling
I see you in a lonely place
How can you be so blind?
You're still regretting the love you left
Left behind
I see you in a lonely place
How can you be so blind?
You're still regretting the love you left
Left behind
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be so blind?
I see you in a lonely place
How can you be so blind?
You're still regretting the love you left
Left behind
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be so
How can you be
How can you be
How can you be so blind?
