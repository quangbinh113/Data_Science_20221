Song Name: Big Jet Plane
Hello mister
Pleased to meet you
I want to hold her
I want to kiss her
She smelled of daisies
She smelled of daisies
She drives me crazy
She drives me crazy
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Be my lover
My lady river
Can I take you
Take you higher?

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Gonna hold you
Gonna kiss you in my arms
Gonna take you away from home
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
