Song Name: Butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
Where you gonna go tonight?
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then you'll take me high
Away from it all again
Away from my troubles and my sins
Away from the fears inside
Away from the tears I try to hide away
'Cause I just want to make you smile, but
I know that'll take a while
'Cause I'm
I'm tryin' to find myself
I just want to make you proud, but
I think that I'm runnin' out of time
To figure it out
Butterfly, butterfly
Take me on your wings and fly (ooh)
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then I'll see the light
And I could be free again (free, free, free)
Free from my troubles and my sins
Free from the tears inside (free, free, free)
And free from the fears I try to hide away
'Cause I just want to make you smile, but (ooh)
I know that'll take a while
'Cause I'm (ooh)
Tryin' to find myself (ooh)
And I just want to make you proud, but (I just wanna)
I think that I'm runnin' out of time (I'm runnin' out of)
To figure it out
To figure it out (oh woah, oh woah)
Out (oh woah, oh woah)
Out (oh)
To figure it out
Out
To figure it out
I'm tryna figure this out (out, out, out)
To figure it out
I'm tryna figure this out (out, out)
