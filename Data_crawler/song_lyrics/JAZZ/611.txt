Song Name: Walk On By
If you see me walking ddown the street
And i start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private
Cause each time i see you i break down and cry
Walk on by.
I just can't get over losing you and so if i seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride that's all that i have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by.
If you see me walking down the street and i start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private
Cause each tim i see you i break down and cry
Walk on by
I just can't get over losing you an so if I seem broken and blue walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride is all I have left so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me whe nyou said goodbye
Walk on by
Walk on by
