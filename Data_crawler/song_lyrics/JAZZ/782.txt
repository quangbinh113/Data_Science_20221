I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I got sunshine
I got sunshine
I got sunshine
I got sunshine
I got sunshine in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
Will someone finally let me out of my cageI'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
Finally someone let me out of my cage
I've been waiting here to let go of this rage
And take me or leave me or just let me be
I'm gonna give it to you one two three
And give you sunshine a b c
Won't you come with me
I got sunshine
I'm gonna make you feel so fine
I'm gonna bring you up high
I'm gonna make you high
I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
Well I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I'm happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
Well I'm useless, but not for long
The future, it's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming coming on
It's coming coming coming on
