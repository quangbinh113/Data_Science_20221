Song Name: River - King Kavalier Remix
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
How do you fall in love?
Harder than a bullet could hit you
How do we fall apart?
Faster than a hair pin trigger
Don't you say, don't you say it, don't say
Don't you say it, one breath and it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river
Shut your mouth
Baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands oh they make me a sinner
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love till the veins start to shiver
One last breath till the tears start to wither
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Tales of an endless heart
Cursed is the fool who's willing
Can't change the way we are
One kiss away from killing
Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river
Shut your mouth
Baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands oh they make me a sinner
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love till the veins start to shiver
One last breath till the tears start to wither
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Hey! Ooh oh oh
Hey! Ooh oh oh
Like a river!
Hey! Ooh oh oh
Ooh oh oh
Like a river!
Shut your mouth
Baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, oh they make me a sinner
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love till the veins start to shiver
One last breath till the tears start to wither
Like a river
Like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
