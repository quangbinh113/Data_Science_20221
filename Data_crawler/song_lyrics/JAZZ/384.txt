Song Name: Kiss My (Uh Oh)
Uh oh, uh oh, oh-oh
Don't wanna hear one more lie
That used to work, but not tonight
And that's the last time you do me wrong (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Got my stuff, I'm out the door
Now I'm the one you're begging for
Don't know what you got until it's gone (ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Uh oh) already know how this goes
(Uh oh) give you my all, then you ghost
(Uh oh) but when I'm gone you do the most, yeah (uh oh)
Why you only lo-o-ove me when I'm walking away?
Only ever wa-a-ant me when I don't want to stay
Love the feeling, hitting different
I'm not ever looking back
While I'm leaving, I see you staring
Go ahead boy, you can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh)
You can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh)
You can kiss my
The only time I'm in your head
Is when you're alone up in your bed
Boy, I ain't the one, you got me wrong (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Yeah, you send me roses everyday
But I know the game you play
Boy, all you did was make me strong (ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Uh oh) 'cause I already know how this goes
(Uh oh, oh-oh) give you my all, then you ghost
(Uh oh) but when I'm gone, you do the most, yeah (uh oh)
Why you only lo-o-ove me (love me) when I'm walking away?
Only ever wa-a-ant me when I don't want to stay?
Love the feeling, hitting different
I'm not ever looking back
While I'm leaving, I see you staring
Go ahead, boy (you can kiss my)
(Uh oh) yeah
(Uh oh) you can kiss my
(Uh oh) oh
(Uh oh) you can kiss my
Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh)
Go on and on 'bout the times we had
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh)
Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh) (you can, you can)
Go on and on 'bout the times we had
Baby, you can kiss my
Why you only lo-o-ove me when I'm walking away? (Walking away)
Only ever wa-a-ant me (want me, yeah)
When I don't want to stay (I don't wanna stay)
Love the feeling, hitting different
I'm not ever looking back (I'm not ever looking back)
While I'm leaving, I see you staring
Go ahead boy, you can kiss my
(Uh oh) ooh
(Uh oh) you can kiss my
(Uh oh) lie, lie
(Uh oh) yeah, you can kiss my
Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my (you can kiss my)
Go on and on 'bout the times we had
Baby, you can kiss my (yeah, you can kiss my)
You can kiss my
