Song Name: Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Mmm let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it
Still we can try
To make a go of it
'Cause we might have been meant for each other
To be
Or not to be
Let's let our own hearts discover
Well let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Now is the time for it
While we are young
Come on let's fall in love
Well we might have been meant for each other
Haa to be
Or not to be
Come on let
Let our own hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Now is the time for it
While we are young
Let's fall in love
