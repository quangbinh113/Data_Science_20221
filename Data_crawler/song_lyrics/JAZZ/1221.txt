Song Name: Concrete Jungle
No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play (won't come out to play)
Darkness has covered my light
(And has changed) and has changed my day into night
Now where is this love to be found
Won't someone help me?
'Cause life (sweet life) must be somewhere to be found
Instead of a concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Where the livin' is hardest (concrete jungle)
A concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you've got to do your best (concrete jungle)
No chains around my feet but I'm not free (I'm not free)
I know I am bound here in captivity
And I've never known happiness (I've never known)
I've never known sweet caresses (I've never known)
Still, I be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me?
'Cause life (sweet life) I've got to pick myself from off the ground
In this here concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
I say, what do you got for me now? (Concrete jungle)
A concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Oh, why won't you let me be now? (Concrete jungle)
I said, "Life must be somewhere to be found"
Instead of a concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
You name it, we got it
(Concrete jungle)
(Jungle, jungle, jungle)
You name it, we got it
(Concrete jungle)
