Song Name: Blueberry Hill
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And it was and until my dream come true
The wind and the willows play, love sweet melody
And all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
Now come climb the hill with me, baby
We'll see what we will see
I'll bring my horn with me
I'll be with you where berries are blue, yes
Each afternoon we'll go, yeah
Higher than the moon we'll go
To a weddin' in June we'll go
Ba ba da d bzz bzz va d in da day
The wind and the willows play, yes, I love sweet melody
And all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart, yeah, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill, yeah on Blueberry Hill
Ba ba da d bzz bzz va d in da day
