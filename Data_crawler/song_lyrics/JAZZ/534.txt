Song Name: Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go Jamaica?
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all

And bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go (ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo)
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea and we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight, cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye, give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go (ooh, I want to take you down to Kokomo)
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we want to go
Way down in Kokomo
Port au Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go (ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo)
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go...
