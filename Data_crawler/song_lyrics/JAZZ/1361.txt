Song Name: Everytime We Say Goodbye
Every time, we say goodbay
I die a little every time
We say goodbay i wonder why a little
Why the gods upon me, who must be end
Think so litlle love me, the own you too vote
When your need, there is such a name
Off spring aboved all get here
All like somewhere, begin to sing about it
There is no love so fiber
But a strange the change
From mayor to minor
Everytime we say goodbye
Everytime we say goodbye
Every single time we say goodbye
